Knuckledusters, hammers and a meat cleaver were among weapons retrieved after a brawl between rival biker gangs at Birmingham Airport, a court heard.  Up to 30 bikers fought inside a terminal building in January 2008, Birmingham Crown Court was told.  The prosecution said onlookers were left frightened and distressed following the battle between members of the Hells Angels and Outlaws gangs.  Twelve men deny charges of riot and an alternative charge of violent disorder.  Timothy Raggatt QC said the weapons were recovered after the violence during the evening of 20 January.  He told the court the two groups had a long-standing rivalry.  "In the course of what happened, a variety or, in some cases quite alarming, weapons were used.  "There were knives produced, there was certainly a machete produced and there were various blunt instruments," he said.  He said a number of people involved were injured, although no members of the public were hurt.  Seven of the men on trial are Outlaw members. The other five are known to be Hells Angels.
