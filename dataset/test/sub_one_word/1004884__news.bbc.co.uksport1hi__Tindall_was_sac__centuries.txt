The Terras lost 3-2 at Rushden and Diamonds on Saturday, and lie 19th in the Blue Square Premier table, five points off the relegation zone.  Tindall became player-manager in January 2007, guiding the club to a mid-table finish last term.  However, this season the Dorset club have struggled, recording just three home wins.  In a statement the club said: "Regretfully, following the recent run of frustrating league results, the board feels that it is paramount to act decisively in order to secure the long-term future of the club.  "Remaining in the Blue Square Premier is of the upmost importance to the club's continued progression."
