The preferred location for a town's first railway station in 50 years has been revealed.  Lancashire County Council has earmarked land on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College.  The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused.  The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre.  The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council.  County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an "exciting step forward".  He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion.  He added: "It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area."  The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land.  Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961..  It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station.
