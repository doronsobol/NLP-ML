A major redevelopment of an historic park close to the centre of Ipswich is near completion.  More than £3m has been invested in Christchurch Park by the Heritage Lottery Fund, with another £1.4m coming from the borough council.  Work has included a new pavilion and paths, restoration of Brett Fountain, creating a bird reserve and a new-look Round Pond.  The park in Suffolk is expected to be officially opened next month.  Christchurch was the first public park in Ipswich, opening in 1895.  It is home to Christchurch Mansion, which contains the Wolsey Art Gallery.
