About 900 pigs have died after a large fire that destroyed a piggery at a farm in Dorset.  The fire swept through the 330ft-long complex after the blaze was reported in its roof early on Friday morning at Seaborough Manor near Beaminster.  Fifty firefighters were involved in tackling the incident for up to three hours.  Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said crews would stay at the scene overnight and an investigation has been launched.  A fire service spokeswoman said: "There was an asbestos roof involved in the fire with no affect to any other properties. Crews were at work protecting adjacent piggeries and property.  "There was 100% severe damage to the piggery and sadly approximately 900 pigs lost their lives in the fire.  "Firefighters will be in attendance through the night keeping an eye on the site."  In May last year, 180 piglets and 18 sows died in a fire at Corton Farm in Friar Waddon, Weymouth in Dorset.  The large farrowing unit suffered severe fire damage and none of the pigs survived.
