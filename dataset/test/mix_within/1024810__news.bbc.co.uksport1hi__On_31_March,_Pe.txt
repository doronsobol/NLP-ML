The incident occured before the team's Under-21 European Championships qualifier against Turkey and Pennant was sent back to club side Arsenal by coach David Platt.  The incident led to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger warning Pennant that he would have no future with the Gunners if he did not improve his discipline.  "I have apologised to the three main people who look after my football, who are David Platt, (England Under-21 coach) David Dein (Arsenal vice-chairman) and my boss Mr Arsene Wenger.  "I have called them to apologise and I said sorry and it won't happen again.  "You do learn from your mistakes and now I'm going to put my head down and work hard in training and get my attitude right and get back into the squad."  Pennant was signed four years ago as the most expensive teenager in Britain in a £2m deal from Notts County.  And after his return to Highbury, Wenger said: "I hope he'll learn from this as you can understand that young boys make mistakes. But if they don't learn, there's no future for them.  "Some players who appeared for England against Turkey have made mistakes in the past but they have learned from them. His future is down to him now.  "The biggest part of success until 20 is how much talent you have and, after 20, it's how much you want it."  Wenger could turn to former skipper Tony Adams, who overcame alcohol problems during his successful spell at Highbury, to help guide Pennant in the right direction.  "We will help him to control his life better and someone like Tony Adams could be a big help in that," he revealed.
