The BBC's interactive services have been relaunched as BBCi, bringing together BBC Online, BBC Text and BBC Interactive under a single identity.  Digital television viewers will be able to access a host of new interactive features, which will first be available during the run of flagship documentary Walking with Beasts on 15 November.  Viewers will be alerted to extra interactive content for a TV show by an "i" logo appearing on screen.  They can then click the text button on their remote control to bring up the BBCi-bar, which offers on-screen information and links about the programme, as well as the latest news, weather and sport.  The award-winning website BBC Online has also undergone a redesign to streamline the corporation's extensive web content.  There is a new look homepage, bearing the BBCi logo and navigation bar which takes users to the site's most popular areas and pages.  The navigation bar now goes across all of the corporation's web content, including its news site, and features a new search facility for ease of use.  It will provide users with up to three of the best BBC links with every search.  There is also more emphasis on communicating, as web users can log on to message boards, chatrooms and live forums.
