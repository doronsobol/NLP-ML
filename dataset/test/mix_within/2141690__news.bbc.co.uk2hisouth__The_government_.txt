Ghulam Nabi Lone was shot at his home in the summer capital Srinagar and died on his way to hospital, police say.  At least three other people were killed in the attack, including one militant, police say.  Violence has continued in Kashmir despite the earthquake 10 days ago which killed more than 1,400 people in Indian-administered Kashmir.  As many as 40,000 people have died in the part of Kashmir administered by Pakistan, officials say.  Police say two militants scaled the wall of the minister's house, located in the high-security Tulsibagh area, and shot Mr Lone.  One militant died when security men at Mr Lone's house returned fire.  A policeman and a security guard have also died in the attack.  The militant group Al Mansurian called the BBC office in Srinagar and said it had carried out the attack.  The attack comes as aid workers have been struggling to reach the survivors of the devastating earthquake.  Last week, the Indian army said there had been no let-up in separatist violence in Kashmir despite the earthquake. The army had killed at least 29 militants in the past week, a military spokesman said.  However, an umbrella body of groups fighting Indian rule in divided Kashmir, the United Jihad Council, said it had called a temporary halt to operations against the Indian security forces.  India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in its entirety and have fought two wars over the region since independence.
