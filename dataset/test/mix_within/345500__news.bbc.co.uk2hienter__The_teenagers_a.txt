The 29-year-old star, who found fame with reality TV band Hear'Say, went into labour shortly after co-hosting The One Show on BBC One on Wednesday.  The baby, which weighed in at 5lbs 9oz (2.5kg), arrived at 1345 BST, three-and-a-half weeks early.  Klass' fiance Graham Quinn was by her side. "Myleene had a problem-free labour," her spokeswoman said. "Mother and baby are doing well."  Presenter Christine Bleakley will replace Klass on The One Show during her maternity leave.  Klass' colleagues on the magazine programme said they were "delighted and thrilled" for her.  The host's spokesman said: "Myleene presented The One Show and felt a bit weird on the way home.  "She went to the hospital to get checked out and they told her she was in labour. The birth went very smoothly and all is well, but her stint on the show is obviously over for now.  "She is looking forward to returning to work after some time off with Ava."  The classically-trained singer first found fame on TV reality show Popstars in 2001 and came second in last year's ITV reality TV show, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.  She also starred in a Marks and Spencers advertising campaign with models Erin O'Connor and Twiggy.  Klass began her relationship with Quinn in 2001 when he worked as a bodyguard for Hear'Say.
