These are The Bay, in Morecambe, Lancashire, and three stations in Northern Ireland - Belfast's City Beat 96.7, Heart Beat 1521 in Craigavon and Gold Beat in Cookstown. They have until the end of the month to respond.  Oysten's wife, Vicky, a former Miss Blackpool, has been acting as chairperson of the group of companies since he was jailed.  If the Authority concludes that Oyston retains controlling interest in the stations, their licences could be withdrawn and ultimately re-advertised.
