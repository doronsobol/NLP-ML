The United Nations chief refugee official, Sadako Ogata, has expressed doubts that Serb refugees from Kosovo will be able to return to their homes soon.  Mrs Ogata was speaking during a tour of Serbia, where she visited collective centres for Serb refugees from Kosovo and Croatia.  Serbia hosts the largest refugee population in Europe, with more than 700,000 refugees from the wars in the former Yugoslavia.  Mrs Ogata gave a stark assessment of the position of Serbs in Kosovo. The security situation in the province, she said, was not one in which the UN refugee agency could promote returns.  She said there were still people fleeing.  Her remarks are the latest acknowledgement by the international community of its failure to reassure and protect Serbs and other ethnic minorities.
