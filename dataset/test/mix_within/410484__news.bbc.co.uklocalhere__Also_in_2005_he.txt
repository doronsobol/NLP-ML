The Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond was one of the main reasons for a record attendance at the 31st Herefordshire Country Fair.  Nearly 15,000 people were drawn to the event, causing gridlock on surrounding roads.  Richard is the President for the annual fair this year, held in the grounds of Hampton Court, at Hope under Dinmore.  He said: "The day's been a huge success, judging by the queue outside, it's enormous!  "As an event, it's really showing off the Herefordshire county, where the country isn't just something to be looked at, it's a place that people work in and live in, and base their existence on it."  Richard spent much of the afternoon signing autographs and chatting to fans.
