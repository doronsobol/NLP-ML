Sunshine has returned to the capital following four days of dense fog in which London transport was brought to a standstill.  The atrocious conditions led to widespread disruption of rail, road and air services and affected shipping on the River Thames.  As freshening winds and milder temperatures dissipated the fog today London buses and coaches ran normally but still with some delays on the Southern Region railway.  The fog, which began on 5 December, also affected other areas of the south-east, with icy roads causing several road accidents. Ambulancemen and firemen had to walk ahead of their vehicles to reach those in need.  It also spread as far as northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  A cross-channel ferry carrying 300 passengers from Folkestone to Calais was 15 hours late. The ship had to anchor off the French coast, unable to get into port due to poor visibility.  Fog descended on London once again yesterday evening at the end of a relatively clear day.  By 1830 London Transport reported a virtual shutdown of its north-east London service and nearly all buses were out of action.  Only the London Underground was still running, but as buses stopped running once visibility was reduced to a few hundred yards this too became congested.  At Stratford, on the Central Line, 3,000 people queued for tickets.  London Airport was also severely affected - BOAC reported just two departures and four arrivals yesterday. All other flights were diverted to Hurn, near Bournemouth and passengers were taken by train to Waterloo.  The severe weather conditions led to a rise in crime as robbers used the cover of fog to break into houses and shops and attack and steal from Londoners making their way home in the darkness.  The weather even affected cattle brought into Earls Court in preparation for the Smithfield Show.  Farmers spent hours trying to reach the capital and when they finally arrived found many livestock had breathing difficulties. At least one animal died.  There was no escape from the fog inside either, as it seeped into buildings as well as filling the streets.  Last night, the Sadler's Wells threatre had to end a performance of La Traviata after the first act because the auditorium had filled with fog.  The fog also took its toll on several sporting events. A University Association Football due to take place at Wembley was postponed. It is the first time any fixture has been cancelled at the stadium since it opened in 1923.  Most rugby matches were cancelled and no Association Football League matches took place in London.
