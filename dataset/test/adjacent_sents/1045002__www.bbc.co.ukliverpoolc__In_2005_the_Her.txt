In 2005 the Heritage Group of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers awarded its first Blue Plaque to St George's Hall recognising it as the World's First Air Conditioned Building.

The original plans for the building did not allow for the ventilation system which was recommended at a later date.  The aim of the system was to warm and ventilate the building without draughts.   Fresh air was brought into the building via shafts at the eastern portico and the used air expelled through grilles in the ceiling into the roof spaces.  The air was warmed by five hot water pipes heated by two coke-fired boilers and two steam boilers.   Four ten foot-wide fans distributed the air and circulated air for cooling.  Control of the air into and out of the individual rooms was largely manual and involved an army of workers opening and closing a series of canvas flaps.  Only two rooms could control their own heating. The judges and court clerks had a system of valves beneath their benches.  The system no longer works but the refurbishment will restore some of it as a display piece.
