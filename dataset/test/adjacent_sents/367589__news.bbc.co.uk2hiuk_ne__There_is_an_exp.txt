There is an expanding range of restaurants in the new shopping centre, mainly national chains.

The development will include a multi screen cinema, Debenhams department store and new market hall.  The plans for the old mart site in the centre of the town have been on the drawing board for more than five years.  But various disputes over the relocation of the indoor market, road closures and pedestrianisation of surrounding streets delayed progress.  The development, called St Catherine's Walk, was allowed to proceed after the scheme cleared its final hurdle in November.  A planning inquiry ruled potential problems caused by closing an access lane at the site would be "negligible".  Objectors forced the public inquiry by claiming Fair Lane was a vital link for people living to the north of the town.  But a Welsh Assembly Government appointed planning inspector gave the go-ahead to close Fair Lane.  Work on the scheme is expected to take around 18 months to complete.  It also includes restaurants and a multi-storey car park.  Developers Simons say it will create 500 jobs.
