The Australian, 39, only joined Bath last month, having spent four years on the coaching staff at Stade Francais.  But having impressed in his short time at the club, Meehan could see his new role become permanent according to Bath chief executive Bob Calleja.  "Steve has already demonstrated that he has the leadership skills necessary for this role," Calleja said. "This is a great opportunity for him."  Bath recently appointed New Zealander Mark Bakewell, who has worked in Australia and France, as their new forwards coach.  They now hope to appoint a defence and skills coach as soon as possible to complement the Antipodean duo.  The club were forced to find a completely new coaching team this summer after former head coach Brian Ashton joined the England set-up, forwards coach Michael Foley returned to Australia and skills coach Richard Graham joined Saracens.
