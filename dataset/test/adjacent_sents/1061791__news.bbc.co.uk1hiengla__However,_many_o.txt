However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.

Hundreds of mourners gathered for the funeral of Private Arthur Foster, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was 27 when he died.  He was killed in World War Two during the doomed attempt to capture the bridge at Arnhem in 1944.  The ceremony was held at Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery on Wednesday.  The failed operation which claimed the life of Pte Foster was known as "Operation Market Garden".  The service was conducted by the Rev Robert Williams, chaplain of the First Battalion of the King's Own Royal Border Regiment (KORBR), which recruits from north Lancashire and Cumbria.  Mr Williams said: "By the honour of this special event and ceremony we show no particulars or favourites. Pte Foster would not want that.  "In saluting him we salute him and all his comrades, whose lives were laid down or taken in the cause of freedom."  War veterans were also among those at the ceremony.  After the war, Pte Foster was one of 33 soldiers from the Border Regiment with no known grave commemorated on the Groesbeek Memorial near Nijmegen.  Workmen discovered his almost-complete remains early in 2003 when a barn was demolished near Oosterbeek.  Pte Foster's family were only traced in August last year.  His niece, Mrs Sheldon, said: "I think my uncle would have been highly honoured.  "It is especially good that he should be buried with his friends and comrades, so they are all together."  Mrs Sheldon said it was a "complete shock" when she found out her uncle's body had been discovered.
