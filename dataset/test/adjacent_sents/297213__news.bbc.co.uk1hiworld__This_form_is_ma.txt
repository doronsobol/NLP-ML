This form is mainly practiced by the elite and middle class Indians.

A growing trend is for people to go online to get their daily dose of religion.  Religion is very important to most Indians, and the country is dotted with temples and religious shrines.  But increasingly, many young Indians are expressing their discontent with organised religion and are seeking alternatives.  Madras, in the deep south, has for years been a very conservative city. The city's Tamil majority population is deeply religious, and the city and its surrounding areas has some of the country's oldest and most magnificent temples.  But the city is also very modern and, economically, is one of the country's most progressive. It is at the centre of the growing automobile industry as is an important player in the cutting edge IT industry.  Advertising director Dinesh Damodaran is typical of many of the young executives in today's India.  He holds a high-pressure job in a demanding profession, working to tight deadlines.  With growing stress levels, young people like him are seeking a way to release their anxieties. But a visit to the neighbourhood temple is not what he has in mind.  "A lot of religious practices have been handed down from generation to generation. A lot of it has lost its relevance. I think modern-day youth want something with a direct impact on what they do."  In an India at the forefront of an IT revolution, it is not surprising that an online portal decided to cash in on this need for immediate salvation.  Mahesh Mohanan set up saranam.com, a website which sells religious services, in 1999.  For a fee ranging from $4 to $300, Indians can perform virtual complex religious ceremonies in any temple in the country.  "People just log in, go through our services and place an order," says Mohanan.  "We have a network of priests, we call them franchisees. They go out and perform the ceremony."  Mr Mohanan hit upon the idea when he had to make a pilgrimage to several temples after he got married, and just found the experience too arduous.  "Basically, people don't have time," he says.  "It's much easier. They don't have to worry about things like parking, and everyone has an internet connection."  But it is not just Hindus - people from other religions too are look for fresh approaches.  Many of India's Christians, for instance, are being swayed by the growing influence of evangelists.  The Apostolic Tabernacle church is located in one of Madras oldest neighbourhoods, Vadamalai. The church itself, however, is brand new - a low-rise building with a large, neon cross.  Inside hundreds of worshippers are gathered in a packed auditorium. The pastor, Reverend Sam Chelladurai, is one of they city's best-known preachers and was trained in the United States.  His congregation is mixed - men and women, affluent and working class, and predominantly young.  Reverend Chelladurai also has a popular television programme on God TV, an evangelist channel.  "Today the world is ridden with all kinds of problems; young people are going through divorce, financial trouble, job and career related problems," he says.  "It's a very competitive world, one that puts a lot of tension in them.  "They come here and they begin to hear some hope. We use music for that purpose."  As for stressed-out advertising executive Dinesh Damodaran, the answer lies in a meditation technique once popular among Buddhists.  "I meditate using the Vipassana technique - it's very effective, it helps me handle the day-to-day pressure of work," he says.  "You feel a lot more calm and are more productive at work."  Vipassana is growing in popularity in India. Many institutions - both government and private sector - now offer courses for their employees.  India's booming economy is increasingly having an impact on how young urban Indians lead their lives.  And in a country with religious practices that date back centuries, some traditions are clearly having to adapt to changing needs.
