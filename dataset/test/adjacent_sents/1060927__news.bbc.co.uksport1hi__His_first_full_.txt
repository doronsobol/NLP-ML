The 30-year-old moves to United on a free transfer, after a clause in his contract enabled him to leave after Swindon's relegation to League Two.  Meanwhile, veteran defender Steve Jenkins will not be offered a new contract by Swindon when his current deal expires at the end of June.  The 34-year-old is now free to leave the County Ground.  Cureton told BBC Essex: "There's been a lot of speculation and I'm glad it's all sorted now. Being here last season has played a massive part in my coming back.  "It's not like joining a new club and the fans were good to me last season. I'd have been happy to stay until the end of last season but Swindon wanted me back and I went and did a professional job and tried my hardest to keep the club up.  "I think Colchester are a club where I feel comfortable and settled and when that happens I play my best football and it's a nice close knit club and I'm happy to be a part of it again."
