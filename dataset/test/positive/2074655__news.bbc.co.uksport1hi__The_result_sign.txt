The result significantly boosted Schumacher's championship standing, placing him third overallâ€”no driver above him in driver championship points took part in the race.

Because of the Michelin tyre safety row the only cars on the starting grid were those of Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi.  Rubens Barrichello took second, despite being shunted onto the grass by Schumacher after his 51st lap pit-stop, to give Ferrari 18 championship points.  Tiago Monteiro and Narain Karthikeyan, Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher took up the other places.  Schumacher's first victory of the season saw him earn a valuable 10 points in the world championship standings, to move to third place in the table on 34 points, behind leader Fernando Alonso and second placed Kimi Raikkonen.  Barrichello's eight points saw him rise to fourth in the standings.  But many fans did not stay to see the outcome of the race, choosing instead to leave early.  Missiles were thrown onto the circuit during the race, and the cars crossed the finishing line to shouts of derision from spectators.  While the Jordan team celebrated Monteiro's podium place enthusiastically, after the race Schumacher was somewhat restrained in his reaction.  "It was a bit of a strange Grand Prix, it's not the right way to win my first race of the year, but to have one win out of 84 being like this isn't too bad," he said.  "Obviously I would have wished to fight the race under normal circumstances.  "I think we had a good car so I think we had a very fair chance to fight for the victory."  But it was a hollow victory and left many questioning F1's future in America.
