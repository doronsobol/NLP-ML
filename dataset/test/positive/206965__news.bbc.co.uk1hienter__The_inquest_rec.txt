Music producer Gus Dudgeon, who produced some of Elton John's biggest hits of the 70s, has died in a car crash aged 59.  Dudgeon was killed on Sunday when his vehicle veered off the M4 between Reading and Maidenhead, and plunged down an embankment.  John was said to be "devastated" by the news. "He was an incredibly talented producer and a dear friend for several years. I will miss him terribly," he said on his website.  Dudgeon produced many of the singer's classics tracks, including Your Song, Rocket Man and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.  In an interview in The New York Times, he said, "We lose everything. We lost the World Cup. We lost Wimbledon. But we do it with grace and style because we're used to it."  The 69-year-old also suggested that he was hated in the UK because of his overseas success. "But that's OK," he added. "I'd rather have people hate me than fail."  Caine stars in the new Austin Powers film Goldmember, which is released in the UK and US on Friday.
