Hereford Livestock Market's controversial move to a new site after more than 150 years in the city centre has been hailed a "success story" a year on.  The market moved to a £7m home at Stretton Sugwas, on the outskirts of the city centre, to make way for the £90m regeneration around Edgar Street.  Richard Hyde, director of Hereford Market Auctioneers, which has run both sites, said sales were up and the new market was attracting more visitors.  At about 16 acres, the custom-built site was more than double the size and much more accessible, he said.  "We've brought people back who haven't been to Hereford for 20 years because of the congestion and parking and difficulty getting in and out," he said.  "There are new people virtually every week."  Mr Hyde said there had a "phenomenal" increase in the number of cows sold through the market, with 2012 so far seeing a 59% increase.  Meanwhile, the number of sheep sales was up about 22%.  He said this time of year was particularly busy for lamb sales.  "At the moment, lamb numbers through this market are in the top three in the country," he said.  Mr Hyde said the site along the Roman Road, which can accommodate about 240,000 animals a year and is set to expand, suited the future of farming.  "Food production is massively important," he said.  "The new site is an absolute godsend. It is what state-of the-art marketing in the 21st Century should be - ease of access, ease of parking. It's customer friendly and it's animal friendly. It is very nearly perfect."  He said in contrast, the city centre site "was a nightmare on busy days".  The departure of the market from the city centre was met with criticism, particularly by some residents who said a slice of history would be lost as well as the market's distinctive atmosphere.  The cost of the move, which was funded by Conservative-run Herefordshire Council, was also criticised.  Mark Hubbard, leads the nine It's Our County councillors who had raised objections over the scheme.  He said the group was not against the move itself but had "asked questions" over the costs being borne by taxpayers.  "I'm very glad that it's doing well, because that is what Herefordshire is about," he said.  However, Mr Hubbard said you had to consider how much the old site could have been improved with a £7m upgrade.  In addition, the party is opposed to the £90m retail development on the old cattle market site, which he said would "absolutely" damage the "traditional market town centre" and its shops.  "Also it's the idea of such a retail development being built during a recession when everywhere else is contracting its retail offer," he said.  Meanwhile, Elwyn Maddy, a beef and sheep farmer from Michaelchurch Escley, said there had been fears the market could have been lost for good.  "There had been a lot of opposition about spending that sort of money but it's important for the farming and rural community and it's success answers criticism that we did not need it."  A farmer for 40 years who sits on the NFU's West Midlands Livestock Board, Mr Maddy added feedback from other farmers had generally been "very positive".  "Without a doubt it's a success story," he said. You're getting livestock from a very large area. The layout is good, the amenities are good, it's all positive."
