Coastguards helped resupply a remote South Pacific island with food after a Cornish sailor called them for help.  Alex Bond from Penryn was on board the 33ft (10m) yacht Mary Powell en route from Hawaii to Australia when he stopped off at Kanton Island.  A food air drop had been delayed and the 24 islanders were starving.  Mr Bond called Falmouth coastguards on his satellite phone and they called the US coastguard in Honolulu who are arranging for emergency supplies.  Mark Thomas, watch manager at Falmouth coastguards, told BBC News: "Mr Bond called us to say the islanders were starving.  "They had not had any food for a number of months and had been living off coconuts and fish.  "He had given them as much food as he could spare, but the situation was quite dire.  "We are liaising with our colleagues in the States to get supplies dropped off as soon as possible."
