Damir Dokic alleged that the boyfriend of the former world number four was behind her disappearance in Croatia.  Dokic told Sportski Zurnal: "Of course I haven't been kidnapped, that's complete nonsense. I've been listening to so much rubbish from my father.  "I need to say this to protect my boyfriend because he has never interfered either with my private life or with my tennis."  Dokic has plummeted to 583 in the world rankings and has a long-standing conflict with her father.  She added: "I don't speak to my father at all any more. I rarely talk to my mum too, over the phone. And we never discuss business or tennis."
