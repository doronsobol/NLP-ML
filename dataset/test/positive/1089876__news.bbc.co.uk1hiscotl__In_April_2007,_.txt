In April 2007, a local farmer painted the sheep which graze on the pyramids bright red with a harmless sheep spray.

The sheep have been released on a hillside beside the M8 between junctions three and four and is the brainchild of Pyramid Business Park.  The stunt in Bathgate was set up "for a bit of fun" to "brighten things up".  Farmer Andrew Jack, who owns the 54-strong flock, spent hours spray painting the woolly mammals. They will be red for a month until sheared.  He said: "They are causing quite a stir with passers-by. It is a bit of fun and it does brighten things up.  "It was a bit messy and it really did take a while, but they look fantastic.  "We used a sheep spray, but it was totally animal friendly and would not do them any harm. We will leave them like that until it is time to shear their coats off."  It comes after the M8 Art project which created artistic talking points along the main travel corridor between east and west.  The 'Sawtooth Ramps', which quickly became known as the pyramids, were the first to be installed in 1993 by artist Patricia Leighton.  They were followed by the 80 foot high 'Horn', which transmits recorded music, poetry and prose, the 'Big Heids' at Eurocentral Terminal site and the Iron Horse at Easterhouse.  Craig Chalmers, senior facilities manager at Pyramids Business Park, said: "We wanted to do something different to brighten up the area and make it a nicer place to work.  "The sheep have become a huge attraction. They look fantastic and they serve the double process of maintaining the grass on the pyramids.  "The dyes are obviously animal friendly and we are now considering replacing them with pink sheep when these ones have their coats sheared."
