At the Court of Appeal in London, Lord Justice Phillips, Mr Justice Jowitt and Mr Justice Moses also dismissed his appeal against his six-year jail sentence.  Oyston, 64, dressed in a dark blue suit with an orange handkerchief in his breast pocket, sank low in the dock as the decision was announced.  The former chairman of Blackpool Football Club was convicted by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court in May last year at the end of an 18-day trial.  He had denied raping and indecently assaulting a former model in the early 1990s when she was 16.  The trial judge, who said he had committed "horrendous" crimes against the girl, jailed him for six years.  After the ruling was delivered, the judges agreed that Mr Oyston should pay _100,000 costs which are to be taxed.
