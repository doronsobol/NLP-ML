The house with the narrowest front in the world has been sold in Scotland.  The one-bedroom property on the island of Great Cumbrae, off the North Ayrshire coast, has been bought by a family from Essex as a holiday home.  Measuring just 1.19m at its narrowest point the house called The Wedge, in Millport, barely has enough room downstairs for the front door.  Owners George and June Allison put it on the market for Â£27,000 in May.  But they refused to say whether they got their asking price for the property.  The paperwork on the sale, agreed earlier this year, was completed this week, according to Mrs Allison.  She said they had decided to sell so they had more spare time without having to look after the upkeep of the house which they had been renting out.  "We are pleased to have sold the house and the people who have bought it are delighted with it.  "They have connections to Millport and we are very happy for them," she said.  She said that the house included a small porch and a studio-lounge-cum-kitchen downstairs and upstairs had a bathroom or shower-room and bedroom.  The house is about 22ft long by 11ft wide or 6.7m by 3.35m, at its widest point.  When the couple bought the house 20 years ago they were oblivious to its record-making potential.  It was only when a newspaper reported a claim that the narrowest house was in the south of England that an architect friend of the couple suggested they measure their property.  So they got their tape measure out to record the exact measurements of their house they dubbed The Wedge because it was shaped like a wedge of cheese.  And the front of The Wedge measured just 47in or 1.19m.  This earned the couple's house a place in the Guinness Book of Records for having a property with the narrowest recorded frontage in the world.
