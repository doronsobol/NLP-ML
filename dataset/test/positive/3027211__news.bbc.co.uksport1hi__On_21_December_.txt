Henri Michel has quit as coach of Africa Cup of Nations co-hosts Equatorial Guinea just weeks before the start of the tournament.  He says he left in protest at interference from "a third party".  The country's sports minister has accused the Frenchman of "sabotage" but Michel said it was the authorities who were undermining him.  "Working conditions were worse than before," Michel said in an interview broadcast by French radio.  "I have stopped my work because there are more problems than before, political problems rather than sporting problems."  It is the second time the French trainer has left the job because of meddling in team affairs.  He briefly left his post in October, before returning following the sacking of the then sports minister.  The most recent dispute centres on a player who was called up by officials rather than by the coach - and a dispute over the location of the team's pre-tournament training camp.  Michel wanted to go to Ghana whereas the government has arranged for the squad to travel to South Africa.  Michel is also angry about outstanding salary payments and the failure of the authorities to repay expenses.  Equatorial Guinea are in Group A at the Nations Cup, along with Zambia, Senegal and Libya.  Former coach Casto Nopo has been drafted in to take charge for the time being.  They are the lowest ranked team at the tournament and will be competing at the CAN for the first time in their history.
