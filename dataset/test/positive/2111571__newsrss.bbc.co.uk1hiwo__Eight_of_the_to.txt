Linda Adams, from California, escaped by faking an asthma attack as she was marched into the jungle.  Mrs Adams told how around 100 heavily-armed rebels attacked her campsite in Bwindi National Park at 0645 (0345 GMT) on Monday after sweeping down from the surrounding hills.  She said they quickly separated Americans and Britons from the group and released most of the others.  Mrs Adams told the Evening Standard newspaper in London that the rebels had tortured the British.  "The group holding the British people treated them quite badly," she said. "A British guy was sitting next to me. I could see he had purple toenails from being beaten."  After seizing their hostages the rebels marched them up a mountain path.  "I told them I had asthma and they let me go. Did they think I might hinder them climbing? They could have shot me but they didn't shoot me. I didn't have my shoes and they gave me my shoes to walk.''  Mrs Adams, a businesswoman, was shocked when told some of her fellow hostages had been killed.  "The sound in the valley, the vibration, was quite a shock," she said. "I heard the gunshots and some noises. I got out of my tent and I walked around the corner to the front and I got caught.  "I saw gentlemen running with guns and four of them came over and grabbed me, all the money that I had, and told me to sit down," she said.  "After a while they brought some of the other captives ... from the other camps, marched them up and asked them what nationality they were. If they were British or American, they were sent to my group.''  The tourists had travelled to the game park in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest to track rare mountain gorillas.  Mrs Adams said her father had warned her not to go on the trip but she ignored him. "It wasn't going to happen to me," she added.
