Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech has returned to full training earlier than expected following a knee injury.  It was originally feared the 29-year-old Czech international would be out for up to four weeks after he damaged knee ligaments in training last month.  However, Cech, who joined Chelsea from Rennes in 2004, has recovered quickly and could now feature in Saturday's Premier League trip to Sunderland.  Deputy Hilario has failed to keep a clean sheet in Cech's absence.
