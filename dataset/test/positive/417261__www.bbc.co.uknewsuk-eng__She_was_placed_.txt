I understand that there is no suggestion of gross misconduct, or dishonesty, or of what was described to me as "impropriety".  Clearly there are serious concerns of some sort, or Professor Purcell wouldn't have been suspended.  But this does help to clarify things, because until now there was no hint at all as to why she had been "placed on leave".  What should we make of this?  Some business leaders are concerned that if the university looks shaky at the top, the impressive investment that's been going on there could start to dry up.  On the other hand, the South West Devon MP Gary Streeter told us that he trusts the governors completely, and if there's a process to be gone through, he's happy for them to go through it.
