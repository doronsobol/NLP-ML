EastEnders actor Dean Gaffney is to leave the BBC One soap, the show's producers have confirmed.  A BBC spokesman said the decision was a "mutual one", taken by producers, writers and actors last week.  He refused to comment on speculation that the actor's departure came after a row over storylines, adding the door will be left open for Gaffney to return.  A spokesman said his character had "provided hours of entertainment" for viewers.  Gaffney joined the EastEnders cast in December 1993 as teenage tearaway Robbie Jackson, who now spends his days sweeping up around Albert Square.  Co-star Bindya Solanki, who plays Robbie's partner Nita, has also been dropped from the show.  Executive producer Louise Berridge said: "Dean and Bindya have contributed an enormous amount to the programme.  "However, we feel that the characters have reached the end of their natural course in the show."  Both actors will leave the show in Spring 2003.  "It is always sad to say goodbye to a good double act and especially to a long-running character like Robbie Jackson, so we will be leaving the door open for both characters," she added.  "I would like to thank Dean for his devotion to EastEnders and Bindy for transforming our loveable loser into a winner at last.  "They will both be personally greatly missed by the cast and crew."
