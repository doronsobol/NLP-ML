Thordarson had been in charge at Meadow Lane since May last year and County ended the season just three points above the relegation zone.  Earlier in the day, Thordarson's assistant Ross MacLaren had also left the club by mutual agreement.  County chairman Jeff Moore said: "We acknowledge the work Gudjon has done for us in difficult circumstances."  Thordarson, who has managed the Iceland national team, has also been in charge of Stoke and Barnsley.  He originally took charge of Stoke in November 1999 but left the club in May 2002 just five days after leading them to victory in the Division Two (now League One) play-off final.  Just over a year later he took over at Oakwell but in March 2004 he was replaced by Paul Hart after a miserable run saw the club pick up just eight points from 11 matches.  When he signed a three-year contract as Notts County boss last May, he became their sixth manager in five years.  During the season he was linked with a move to Leicester and he had been making changes to the squad before his sudden departure.
