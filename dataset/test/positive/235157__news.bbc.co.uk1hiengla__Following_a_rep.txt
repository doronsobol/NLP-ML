Following a replacement after the death of Jade, in 2005 the first cub born to the new Amur leopard pair, Amirah, escaped into the male's enclosure and was killed by her father.

The female Amur leopard cub, which remains unnamed, was born at Marwell Zoo, Hampshire, in November.  A recent census found less than 35 of the creatures, which like to roam large areas of wilderness, left in the wild in far eastern Russia.  Members of the public have been invited to suggest names for the cub online.  The birth was part of a European conservation breeding programme to try to save the breed from extinction.  Until now the three-month-old cub has been kept inside with its mother Ascha.  Last week it experienced its first human contact, when it was sedated and taken for a check up by zoo staff.  Amur leopards were once found in the forests of Russia, Korea and China but their range has diminished due to poaching, as well as the loss of their habitat due to competition with humans for land.  The Wildlife Conservation Society, which carried out the census of Amur leopards, has classified the breed as endangered and threatened with extinction.  "As well as risks posed by man, the small worldwide population size means that the species is particularly vulnerable to inbreeding which can cause genetic problems including reduced fertility.  "Plans are in place to begin the long process of reintroducing the species back to the wild."  In 2005 the zoo bred an Amur leopard called Amirah, but the three-month-old cub entered its father's enclosure and was mauled to death in front of visitors.  In 2003 a two-year-old Amur leopard at the zoo, called Jade, escaped from her enclosure into a tree, but died after falling four metres (13ft) when it was shot by a tranquilliser dart.
