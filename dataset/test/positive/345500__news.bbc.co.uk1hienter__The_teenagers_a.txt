Klass, who presents ITV show CD:UK, was confronted by a group of three girls and two boys in a Bermondsey newsagent.  After dropping a bag of chips on her head they pushed her to the ground. She ran away after one of the youths said: "Shall I bitch slap her?"  Klass, who fronted an anti-bullying campaign, was "very shaken up" by the incident, which she reported to police.  Her spokesman, Simon Jones, said the teenagers attempted to take pictures of Klass on their mobile phones as she escaped.  Earlier this year Klass, 27, helped launch an anti-bullying website on behalf of children's charity NCH, previously the National Children's Home.  Mr Jones said: "The whole point of the anti-bullying campaign was to say 'look, speak out about this'.  "She wants to get the message across about how important it is to report this kind of incident to the police."
