Lawyers were upset by suggestions in the film, which opens across Greece on Friday, that Alexander was bisexual.  They argue there is no historical evidence supporting claims that the Macedonian leader had male lovers.  "Fortunately it was not what we had feared. The people can go and see the movie," said lawyer Giannis Varnakas.  "There is a kiss that can be interpreted in many ways, but we have avoided the worst," added Mr Varnakas.  The group of 25 lawyers had claimed the film was "not a true depiction of Alexander's life", and wanted this made clear to cinema-goers.  They had requested a disclaimer at the start of the film warning audiences that it was not historically accurate.  However director Oliver Stone said there was a historian on set to ensure accuracy.  The lawyers' leader, Mr Varnakos, denied homophobia was the motive behind their action.  "We would have reacted the same way if the issue didn't involve homosexuality," he said.  "We just don't want a distortion of historical facts."  The film opened in the US last week to a slew of negative reviews. It will be released in the UK on 7 January.
