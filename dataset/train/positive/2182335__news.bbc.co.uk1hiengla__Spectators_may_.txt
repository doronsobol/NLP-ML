Spectators may either put on mask, fins and snorkel and enter the pool for a view of the playing area, or possibly take advantage of the work of underwater videographers who have recorded major tournaments.

The world "octopush" championships are being held in 2006 at Ponds Forge and this weekend organisers are testing out a new camera system.  Octopush is an six-a-side game with players pushing a lead puck along the bottom of a pool to the goals.  Organiser Phil Lawrence says he hopes the equipment being tested will increase the profile of the game.
