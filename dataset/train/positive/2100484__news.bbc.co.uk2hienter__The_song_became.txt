Hear'Say are on course for their second consecutive number one this Sunday.  However, they have sold less than a tenth of their first effort in the same period, according to today's figures from the Chart Information Network (CIN).  It is also worth remembering that Hear'Say's album had massive sales so many people will already have this song and will not want to buy it again on single  The track from their debut album Popstars is selling poorly in comparison to their first single Pure and Simple, which sold a staggering 160,995 copies on its first day of sale in March.  The band have remained realistic about their chances, saying they would be delighted with any chart position.  Hear'Say - who were launched on the Popstars TV show - had an early setback when BBC Radio 1 only decided to play the song about once a day.  Their first single Pure and Simple went straight to number one on the back of their TV show's success, and became the most successful debut single ever, shifting half a million copies in its first week.  Their album, Popstars, also went straight to number one when it was released in March - but has dropped out of the top 30.  They are now hoping to prove critics wrong who said their popularity could not be sustained.  Although the first day's sales for The Way To Your Love look somewhat modest, there are mitigating circumstances according to Gennaro Castaldo, chart expert at HMV.  Castaldo said: "It is a very hot week and traditionally music sales take a bit of a breather during the good weather because people don't really want to be indoors listening to music.  "It is also worth remembering that Hear'Say's album had massive sales so many people will already have this song and will not want to buy it again on single."
