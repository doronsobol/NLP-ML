The bombing campaign over the last two days took place near the town of Spin Boldak where officials say they discovered around 40 suspected Taleban.  Afghan and US officials are concerned that Taleban forces are regrouping after they were driven from power 18 months ago.  "Eight enemy were killed in action and Afghan forces have taken 15 persons under control," US military spokesman, Colonel Roger King said on Friday.  He said around 35,000 pounds (16 tonnes) of ordnance and five types of aircraft were used on the rebel positions during the fighting on Wednesday and Thursday.  A spokesman for the Kandahar authorities, Khalid Pashtun, said two government soldiers were killed in the fighting and another two were wounded.  Khan Mohammed, Afghan military commander, said on Thursday: "Six months ago their attacks were sporadic. But today there is a new organisation to the Taleban."  Kandahar province, where Spin Boldak is located, was a powerbase of the Taleban organisation until it was ousted from power in a US-led war in 2001.  Commander Mohammed accused Pakistan of aiding the Taleban's reformation and the director of foreign affairs in Spin Boldak, Khalid Khan said the organisation's former commanders were living safely "in hundreds of homes in Quetta" - the capital of the Pakistani province of Baluchistan.  Afghan interior minister, Ali Ahmad Jalali has said that increased Taleban activity may be linked to the US-led war in Iraq.  A senior Taleban commander has told the BBC the Taleban hopes to regain power in Afghanistan.  Coalition troops continue to patrol and search remote border areas where Taleban and their supporters are thought to be present.
