This provided Claire House children's hospice in Wirral with a £20,000 windfall, the money being paid to Merseytravel by Warner Brothers, the makers of the film, for use of the Tunnel as a location.

Harry Potter fans are able to tour the Mersey tunnel that hosted a chase scene in his latest film.  The wizard and Hagrid race through the Queensway Tunnel in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.  It was closed for four days last year while the scene was filmed. Now, for one night only on 10 December, visitors can walk through its dark corridors.  Merseytravel donated a £20,000 payment from Warner Brothers to charity Claire House hospice after filming.  The tunnel has been previously used for tours, but this one will involve many of the sites where the Potter movie was filmed.  As well as being able to walk out on to the roadway where the scenes were shot, visitors will be able to get a glimpse of the workings of the two-mile tunnel, through which 35,000 vehicles travel a day.  Neil Scales, chief executive of Merseytravel, said: "The feedback from the tours has been tremendous, extremely positive, and they have established themselves as a very popular tourist attraction."  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the penultimate film in the series, and follows Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe, on a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality - the Horcruxes.  It was released in cinemas last month and broke five UK box office records, according to Warner Bros.  Based on the books by JK Rowling, the films have been massive box office hits with many critics saying the last two have been a lot darker than previous instalments.
