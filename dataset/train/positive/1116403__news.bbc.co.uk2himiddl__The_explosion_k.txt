Ali Razini, head of Tehran's judiciary, was attacked by armed assailants while travelling in a car in the capital, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said.  It said a motorcyclist hurled a hand grenade at Mr Razini's car as it was leaving his office in the Imam Khomeini Judicial complex in central Tehran.  Mr Razini was "slightly wounded" in the leg and taken to a hospital, IRNA said. His condition is reported to be satisfactory.  The attack killed another judiciary official and injured Mr Razini's driver and two other people, according to Iranian reports.  Nobody has admitted carrying out the attack, but in the past the armed opposition faction Mujahideen Khalq has claimed responsibility for similar incidents.  Mr Razini, a hard-line conservative who heads the Special Court for the Clergy, is a key supporter of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The attack comes four months after Mohsen Rafiqdoust, a senior economic official, survived an attempt on his life.  In August, the former head of Iran's prisons, Assadollah Lajevardi, was killed by gunmen in Tehran's bazaar.  BBC Middle East Correspondent Jim Muir says activity by the armed Iranian opposition has apparently dwindled in recent months. The focus has instead been on a number of murders of liberal intellectuals and writers.
