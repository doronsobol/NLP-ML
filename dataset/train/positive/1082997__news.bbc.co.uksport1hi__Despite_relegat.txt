"I wouldn't have stayed at Portsmouth. If a League Two club had come in for me, I'd have left," he said.  "It's as simple as that. That's the way it was when I was there, and that's the way I was treated.  "I don't regret the move one bit, I'm happy here and I was willing to come in and have a go and I felt I did that."
