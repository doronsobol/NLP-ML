MotoGP engines will increase in size from 800cc to 1000cc in 2012 after an agreement between the sport's governing body and rights holders on Friday.  The international motorcycling federation (FIM) met with rights holders Dorna in Switzerland to agree the switch and discuss rule changes.  "2012 will be the year of a new era of MotoGP," FIM president Vito Ippolito told the motogp.com website.  "Manufacturers want 1000cc engines, so that's the way now."  The top engine category in MotoGP increased from 500cc to 990cc in 2002 but was reduced to 800cc in 2007 in a bid to reduce costs and cornering speeds.  "With 800cc power is more or less the same (as with 990cc engines) but cornering speed has increased. And costs have increased too."
