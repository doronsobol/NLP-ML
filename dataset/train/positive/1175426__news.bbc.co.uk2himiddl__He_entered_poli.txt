Despite his strong revolutionary credentials - he served in the Iran-Iraq war and his wife is a granddaughter of Ayatollah Khomeini - Mr Khatami is a strong supporter of the president's policies.  He entered politics in 1997 following his brother's landslide victory and was appointed deputy minister of health.  He is now a deputy speaker in the Majlis - the Iranian parliament - as well as secretary general of the Islamic Iran Participation Front (Jebheh-ye Mosharekat-e Iran-e Eslami).  On his election to head the Front, in July 2000, he pledged that "the various reformist parties and other groups must adopt a new strategy".  At the same time Mr Khatami took over as publisher of the party's newspaper, the Mosharekat (Participation) daily.  The paper, however, remains suspended after a November 2000 ban, following its criticism of restraints imposed by the authorities on the Front.
