Shortly afterwards, Forest announced that they would not be re-offering Curtis an improved contract, and that he would therefore be free to leave after 30 June 2007.

Lester and Curtis as well as Gary Holt, Rune Pedersen, John Thompson, Nicky Eaden, Kevin James, Robert Hughes and Vincent Fernandez will exit on 30 June.  Striker Lester made 189 appearances for Forest in two spells with the club, while Curtis, formerly of Manchester United, played 90 games for the club.  Holt made 76 appearances after his arrival from Norwich in 2005.  Thompson, Eaden and James rarely featured in the first team this season - spending much of it on loan at Tranmere, Lincoln and Swindon respectively.  Hughes and Fernandez only made a handful of appearances between them, while keeper Pedersen could only manage 22 games during his two seasons.  Calderwood's decision to release those nine players follows Forest's defeat to Yeovil in the League One play-off semi-final last week.  But Calderwood has offered new deals to Kris Commons, Spencer Weir-Daley, Alan Power and goalkeeper Dale Roberts.
