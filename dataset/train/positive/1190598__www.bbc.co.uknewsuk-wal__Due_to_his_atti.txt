Reports that the serial killer Peter Moore, who was jailed for life in 1996, has died have been denied by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).  A patient at high security Broadmoor hospital with the same name died in July and this was incorrectly reported as being the killer from Conwy.  The error was made in a news agency report which was carried by the BBC and other media outlets.  The MoJ confirmed the reports related to another man called Peter Moore.  The Press Association said its story had been "based on incorrect information".  Broadmoor said there was no connection between it and the serial killer Peter Moore.  Cinema owner Moore, who was dubbed the "man in black" for his trademark black shirt and tie, was responsible for four murders in four months in 1995.
