Vicar of Dibley star Dawn French has married her partner Mark Bignell at a hotel in Cornwall.  The comedian wed charity worker Mr Bignell, whom she began dating in 2011, at the Scarlet hotel near Newquay at the weekend.  It is French's second marriage - she was married to comedian Lenny Henry for 26 years before they divorced in 2010.  The Scarlet hotel in Mawgan Porth describes itself as a "luxury eco hotel" with 37 bedrooms.  French, 55, is set to star in James Corden's new BBC Two comedy thriller The Wrong Mans later this year.  She will play Corden's mother in the series about two lowly office workers who become caught up in a criminal conspiracy after one of them discovers a ringing phone at the scene of a major car crash.  French was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs last December, where she spoke on the programme about the end of her marriage to Henry.  "Those last few months were pretty much like the first few months; we were good friends," she said.  "It was a tribute to the way we'd been married, the way we accomplished it."  The pair, who married in 1984, have an adopted daughter named Billie.  Apart from The Vicar of Dibley, French is best known for her comedy collaboration with Jennifer Saunders, the French and Saunders sketch show, which began in 1987.
