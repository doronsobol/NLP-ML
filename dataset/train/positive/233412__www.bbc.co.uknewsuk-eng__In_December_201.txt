Entertainer Michael Barrymore has admitted possessing cocaine that was found in his pocket after police approached his car in London.  Barrymore, 59, was detained in the early hours of 22 November after his Citroen DS3 hit a kerb in Acton.  The former host of programmes like Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People was fined a total of £780 at Ealing Magistrates' Court.  A charge of being drunk and disorderly was withdrawn at the hearing.  Barrymore, born Michael Parker, was held after officers on routine patrol noticed damage to the Citroen, at the junction of The Vale and Dordrecht Road.  The court heard he swore at officers during an angry rant, saying: "Don't you think I've had enough... from you lot over the years?  After he was arrested he was seen trying to conceal a white substance in his mouth, prosecutor Sally Peters said.  A small white rock was found in his trouser pocket and Barrymore tested positive for cocaine at a police station.  He was told the fine would have been higher had he not pleaded guilty.  Barrymore's lawyer, Richard Gowthorpe, said he only had a "a very small amount" of the drug and apologised to police for his behaviour.  "In many ways it's a sad day for Mr Parker to be before the courts and he's pleaded guilty to this offence," said Mr Gowthorpe.  "Certainly he will be punished to a degree by the conviction itself.  "This behaviour is wholly out of character. This is not part of a general lifestyle that Mr Parker is living."  Mr Gowthorpe told the court Barrymore is no longer using drugs and had sought help after the incident, with which he was making "very good progress".  "It's something Mr Parker has found very helpful and is willing to engage further in that process.  "I would say Mr Parker is doing everything he can do address the issues."  Barrymore was also said to be receiving treatment for alcoholism.
