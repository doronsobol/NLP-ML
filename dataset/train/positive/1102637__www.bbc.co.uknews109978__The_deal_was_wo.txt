Tottenham Hotspur has signed a deal under which specialist bank and asset management firm Investec will become its second shirt sponsor.  Software infrastructure company Autonomy is the White Hart Lane club's shirt sponsor in the Premier League.  Now Investec will become shirt sponsor for Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years.  The new shirt should be worn for a Champions League play-off first leg match away to Swiss side Young Boys.  This season Spurs are also involved in the FA Cup and League Cup competitions.  The club is also looking for a naming rights sponsor for its proposed new stadium.  The Autonomy deal is worth £20m, and the Investec deal is believed to be worth worth £5m over two years, although the club has not disclosed the value.  "It seems if clubs can cut their sponsorship cloth a different way the can extend their offer to more than one brand," says Nigel Currie of sponsorship consultancy Brand Rapport.  "I think that other clubs may now look at ways of increasing the value of their shirt sponsorship."  However it remains to be seen how many fans will fork out for both shirts.  The move to split the shirt sponsorship between league matches and cup competitions is understood to have been the idea of club chairman Daniel Levy.  Autonomy and Investec are only the fifth and sixth brands to appear on the club's shirts, taking over from online betting company Mansion.
