A TV series of groundbreaking 1982 sci-fi film Tron is being made by the Disney Channel, according to reports.  The new show will be aimed at children aged between six and 14, according to trade magazine Mediaweek. It is not clear when it will air.  There are reportedly also plans for a separate 10-part micro-series to be shown in autumn 2011 on Disney XD, the cable channel aimed at young boys.  Big screen 3D re-imagining Tron Legacy, meanwhile, is due out in December.  The new TV shows were revealed at a Disney presentation in New York.  Stills from the Tron Legacy film were also shown.  Gary Marsh, entertainment president and chief creative officer of Disney Channels Worldwide, said: "Tron is another example of how we can take advantage of the intellectual property that the studio unit pays tens, if not hundreds of millions, to develop and market."  The original Tron film starred Jeff Bridges as a software engineer, Kevin Flynn, who becomes trapped in cyberspace.  He will reprise the role in Tron Legacy.
