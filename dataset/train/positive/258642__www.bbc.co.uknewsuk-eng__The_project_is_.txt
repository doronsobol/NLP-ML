Plans to build a new bus station in the centre of Hemel Hempstead have been revealed.  The current station site in Waterhouse Street will be demolished and, together with Market Square, will be developed into a leisure complex.  The new bus interchange will be built next to the Marlowes Shopping Centre on Bridge Street.  The Â£2m project is due to be completed by September 2014, with the leisure complex finished in 2015.  Dacorum Borough Council has approved the project, which will be developed in partnership with Arriva and the county council.  It said the current station had become outdated, and the new location would be more convenient for passengers.  The planned leisure facilities are set to include a multi-screen cinema and a range of restaurants.  Councillor Terry Douris said it was "committed to improving" the town centre, and making it an attractive destination.  "These plans will improve the experience of travelling into Hemel Hempstead, encourage more bus and taxi users and will also bring new businesses into the area," he said.  Under the plans, the existing taxi rank on Bridge Street will also be relocated with new taxi ranks created in the town centre.
