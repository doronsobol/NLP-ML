Heart has taken over as the number one listened to radio station in London, with 1.9 million listeners, overtaking Capital FM for the first time in both the numbers of listeners and the amount of hours the station is listened to.  Jamie Theakston and Harriet Scott took over the breakfast show in April and while their audience figures slid 25% in their first three months they are now on the rise.  Capital's audience has slipped to 1.8 million, down from 1.94 million last quarter.  Barnaby Dawe, managing director of Heart 106.2FM said: "After just six months, the Jamie and Harriet combination has helped put us well ahead in the battle for London's listeners.  "This confirms our support and faith in their talent and appeal."  There was an overall slide of people tuning in to traditional radios, down 0.5% on the previous three months.  But there has been a sharp rise in the number of people listening to radio via digital television sets.  This has gone up 23% since last year and 72% since 2003.  Listening via the internet has also increased, with 13.5% of people surveyed saying they had listened to a national station via the internet.
