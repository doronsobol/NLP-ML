1. FLUSHED 12/05/00     Steve is attempting to dump Jane but she won’t accept it. In the same bar, Patrick is trying to dump Susan, but she humiliates him by saying she didn’t really think they were actually going out together. Jane and Steve have a short-term but very physical reconciliation in the ladies’ toilet. Steve bursts out of the cubicle to get a condom, trips over, and lands at Susan’s feet. They’ve met before - she’s a workmate of Steve’s best friend, Jeff. Neglecting to tell her that he has another girlfriend locked in the cubicle, Steve asks Susan out.      On their first date, all their friends find a reason to tag along too: Jeff, in mortal terror that they will talk about him; Jane, still under the illusion that she’s Steve’s girlfriend; Patrick and Susan’s best friend Sally, on a rebound date. Having tricked Susan into showing them one of her breasts, the six sit down to dinner.      The Wisdom of Jeff: "Yeah, but, Steve, you’re entitled to her stockings... you’re still in the zone… the boyfriend zone. This is the tailing-off period. You’ve still got a load of stuff in her flat. You might still have a wedding to go to together. You’re under joint headings in your friend’s address books."     Most embarrassing moment:   Steve trying to prevent Susan from entering a toilet cubicle, where Jane is awaiting him in state of moist anticipation. "Sorry... erm... still using it... haven’t finished... I was on a break."     Quick question: Where did Steve and Sally first meet?   Find out...
