In a distinguished playing career at Dens Park, he played in 215 league matches, 14 Scottish Cup ties and 45 League Cup games.  He went on to become an integral part of Bill Nicholson's famous Spurs Double-winning team of 1961.  Brown also won 28 caps for his country, which included a thrilling 2-2 draw with England at Wembley in 1965.  Brown, born in Arbroath in 1931, represented Scotland schoolboys before signing for Dundee in September 1949, making his debut in a 1-0 defeat four months later.  Brown won the League Cup with the Dark Blues in 1951 when they defeated Rangers 3-2 and was selected for Scotland for the first time in their last game of the 1958 World Cup finals, against France.  In that time he won two FA Cups, a League championship and a European Cup Winners' Cup medal during Spurs' glory years under the management of Bill Nicholson, who also died recently.  Brown left north London to join Northampton before emigrating to Canada where he played for Toronto Falcons.  He moved into real estate before his death in his adopted homeland.
