The construction of this stand was assisted by the sale of some land to allow the construction of student flats which now lie behind the stand.

Glasgow City Council have given the go-ahead for work to start on a multi-million pound redevelopment of Partick Thistle's Firhill stadium.  The newly-promoted club will now proceed with a deal to build a 384-bed student accommodation facility at the North End of the ground.  Thistle have contracted Barr Construction Ltd to build a new 2,000-seater stand, also at the North End of the ground.  Funding for the project is already in place and it is hoped the improvements will be completed in time for the start of the 2002/3 season.  The projected 10,700 seats will bring Firhill up to the standards required for membership of the Scottish Premier League.  The Jags were the first club in Britain to clinch promotion this year on their impressive route to Division One football.  John Lambie is in his third spell at the helm with Thistle and the club recently announced that he will continue as manager for at least one more year.
