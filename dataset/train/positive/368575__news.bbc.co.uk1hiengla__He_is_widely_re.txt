Mr Hinkes, 50, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, secured his place in the record books when he successfully climbed Kangchenjunga in Nepal in June.  On Friday, he will be made an honorary citizen of his home town at a ceremony in recognition of his achievement.  "He's put Northallerton on the map," a spokeswoman for the town council said.  "We felt we should do something because he's done very well. He's incredible."  Mr Hinkes, a former geography teacher, was born in Northallerton in 1954 and educated at the town's grammar school.  He started his quest to conquer all mountains over a height of 8,000m in 1987.  At 8,586m (28,169ft), Kangchenjunga is the world's third highest mountain and was the final hurdle in Mr Hinkes' challenge.  Only 12 other people have reached the summit of all the mountains over 8,000m.
