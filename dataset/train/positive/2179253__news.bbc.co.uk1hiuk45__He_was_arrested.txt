Hamed, 31, and two others were arrested after the star's Mercedes sports car collided with another car in Sheffield on Monday, injuring two people.  South Yorkshire Police said three men were arrested on suspicion of leaving the scene of an accident.  The three also face claims they attempted to pervert the course of justice. They were bailed until August.  The accident happened in Ringinglow Road at about 1430 BST on Monday.  Police said the boxer's Mercedes was travelling out of the city with a Ford Mondeo when the star's car was in collision with a Volkswagen Golf driving in the opposite direction.  The driver of the Golf had to be cut free from his car before being airlifted to hospital with a suspected broken leg and fractures to both arms. A female passenger also sustained cuts and bruises.  Half of the front wing of the boxer's car was ripped off in the accident.  Earlier, a police spokesman said: "As a result of a road collision, three men have been arrested and taken into custody.  "A 31-year-old and two 26-year-olds are helping us with our inquiries."  He added that one of the 26-year-old men under arrest was taken to hospital after suffering from chest pains.
