In April 2006 the council unveiled a new logo which was to be used in most everyday applications, though the coat of arms will continue to be used for "various civic purposes".

The plans, which could cost up to £6,000, come at a time when Devon County Council is proposing cuts in jobs and services.  Critics have branded the exercise a waste of money.  The council said the simpler design, featuring a pair of leaves to replace the current coat of arms, would save more than £3,000 a year.  The coat of arms features the Latin motto of seafarer Sir Francis Drake: auxilio divino, which means "by divine aid".  But the council said the new logo would reflect its new greener image and also save council tax-payers' money.  Peter Doyle, of the council, said: "Currently, the council's full-colour crest costs us quite a lot of money to reproduce.  "By using this new simple logo we can save £3,200 a year."  But the decision to replace the crest has been branded a money-wasting exercise, especially as the council said in February it was raising council tax by 4.9% because it was facing a £15m shortfall in its budget.  Albert Venison of the Devon Pensioners' Action Forum said: "It's absolutely incredible that we have these sorts of people who are supposed to be looking after the cares and worries of older people, talking about having a new logo.  "I can tell you the sort of logo I'd like: one with a picture of two hands being held up in horror, saying: '"What are they going to do next?'."  The new logo is due to be unveiled in April.
