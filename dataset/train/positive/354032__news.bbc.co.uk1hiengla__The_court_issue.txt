The court issued Alton Towers with a noise abatement order in October 2005 which restricted the theme park to three shows a year, previously five, with noise readings not exceeding 40 decibels outside the park.

The park organised its displays despite waiting for the outcome of an ongoing noise abatement case.  On Friday, a judge ruled the displays could continue and has placed an overall noise limit of 40 decibels on the park.  A spokeswoman said the limit was more than the original noise abatement order had allowed.  The Staffordshire park had been ordered to come up with ways of reducing noise, after losing an appeal against an abatement order brought by residents.  In an earlier ruling, the park was limited to one 30-minute firework display a year.  Traditionally the park held five events at the end of October.  This year it is planning three for 28, 29 and 30 October.
