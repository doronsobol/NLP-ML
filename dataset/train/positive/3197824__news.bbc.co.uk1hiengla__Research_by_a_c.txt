Professor Lynne Liebowitz, senior consultant microbiologist, joined the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, in 2004  She persuaded doctors to vary the antibiotics they prescribe, resulting in a fall in MRSA cases.  Councillors will be able to question her at a meeting on Thursday.  Professor Liebowitz will discuss best practice in avoiding infection and keeping hospitals clean.  She will also answer questions on how Norfolk's infection figures compare with other parts of the country and why some hospitals seem to have a far greater problem than others.  The meeting will also hear the impact of staff wearing uniforms outside the hospital and whether or not hospital laundry facilities have a positive impact.
