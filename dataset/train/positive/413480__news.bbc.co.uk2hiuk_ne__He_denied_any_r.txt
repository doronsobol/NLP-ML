He was arrested in March 2006 after a police raid on his home.  Al Faqih saw the material as a manifesto for resistance against Libya, Birmingham Crown Court was told.  The Metropolitan Police said al Faqih, a Libyan national, was a former member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, who wished to replace his country's government with a fundamentalist Islamic state.

The court heard that al Faqih admitted handwriting a document on how to set up a terror cell.  He pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a document or record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.
