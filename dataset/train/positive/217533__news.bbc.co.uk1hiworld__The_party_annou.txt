A group which broke away from Britain's Conservative Party to campign for British membership of the European single currency says it is to change its name because of voter hostility.  The campaign director of the group, the Pro-Euro Conservative Party, Mark Littlewood, said it had four of the most unpopular words in the English language.  He told the Financial Times newspaper: people hate parties, they hate the Conservatives and they hate the pro-Euro cause.  The group polled only one point per cent of the vote in the recent European Parliament elections.  It is to hold a conference in October to decide on a new name.
