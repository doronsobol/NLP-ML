But as time passed they decided to retire the group name, leaving it to represent the three brothers together.

Singer Robin Gibb has said the death of his twin brother Maurice means the end of the Bee Gees as a group.  Gibb said he would continue working with his surviving brother Barry, but they would no longer use the band's name out of respect for Maurice.  He told the UK's GMTV programme: "Anything Barry and I do we will do together, but it'll be as brothers and not under the name of the Bee Gees. That will be reserved in history as the three of us."  Maurice, who was 53, died from a heart attack during emergency surgery in a Miami hospital on 12 January.  An autopsy report showed he had a congenital condition that caused his small intestine to twist, cutting off the blood supply.  In the interview, Robin described Maurice as his "soulmate" and said: "I am still in disbelief.  "I have never known life without him. We were always doing something together, writing or singing."  Robin confirmed that he and Barry, 56, would continue recording and performing together.  "The music goes on - Maurice would want that," he said.  "Maurice wouldn't want me to stop working and it's something I will need for my own mental health."  He described Maurice as "a great laugh, a great wit and very generous".  "He helped a lot of people and he was always champion of the underdog and people who were going through bad times. So he really was a good man."  During the interview Robin said he and his brother were still "angry" about their brother's death.  He repeated the family's earlier concerns about Maurice's treatment at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, which they expressed in an emotional BBC interview just after his death.  "We are not satisfied with what we have been told," he said. "We believe that this didn't need to happen."  Hospital staff have promised to investigate their concerns.
