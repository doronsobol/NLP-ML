Weston, a retailing expert who is also the owner of major supermarket chains in Canada, has chosen to invest in the renovation of the Oxford Street store – rather than to create new stores in British cities other than Manchester and Birmingham.

Plans for a Bristol store in the Broadmead shopping centre have been pulled, while the future of projects in Newcastle and Leeds now appears uncertain.  Instead, the group looks likely to reinvest in existing sites following a £628m takeover by Canadian billionaire Galen Weston.  With two stores in Manchester and one in Birmingham, the company has almost half its space outside London.  A site in Glasgow's Trongate development has also been purchased for a store in Scotland.  A company spokeswoman said: "No formal commitment had been made to Bristol.  "We have been investigating the possibility of expanding in the city but our new owners have different investment priorities."  In relation to the Glasgow site, she said: "We need to work on that project and we will be submitting our planning application."  The company will continue to look at opportunities in Leeds and Newcastle that "match our new investment priorities", she added.  In past months Selfridges has reported a dip in sales and difficult trading conditions at its flagship London shop but sales have been rising at the firm's two Manchester stores.
