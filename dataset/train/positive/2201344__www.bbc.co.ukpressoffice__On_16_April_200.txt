Tennant, whose recent credits include BBC THREE's critically-acclaimed drama series Casanova, BBC ONE's Blackpool and He Knew He Was Right, will star alongside Billie Piper who returns as Rose Tyler.  Julie Gardner, BBC Head of Drama, Wales says: "Christopher Eccleston has given an exceptional performance as the ninth Doctor.  "David Tennant is a great actor who will build on the excellent work already done by Christopher in establishing Doctor Who for a new generation."  David Tennant says: "I am delighted, excited and honoured to be the tenth Doctor!  "I grew up loving Doctor Who and it has been a lifelong dream to get my very own TARDIS.  "Russell T Davies is one of the best writers television has ever had, and I'm chuffed to bits to get the opportunity to work with him again.  I'm also really looking forward to working with Billie Piper who is so great as Rose.  Taking over from Chris is a daunting prospect; he has done a fantastic job of reinventing the Doctor for a new generation and is a very tough act to follow."  Executive producer/writer Russell T Davies adds: "Christopher Eccelston's wonderful Doctor has reinvented the role, so that it now appeals to the best actors in the land.  I'm already writing David's first new adventure on board the TARDIS!  "Regeneration is a huge part of the programme's mythology, and I'm delighted that new, young viewers can now have the complete Doctor Who experience, as they witness their hero change his face!"  A new 13-part adventure and Christmas special begins filming in Cardiff in the summer for transmission on BBC ONE.
