The 25-year-old, who will arrive from Brann Bergen in January, told the club's website: "Wigan is a club in a great position and with great ambition.  "To play in the Premiership is a dream for me, I am really looking forward to starting with the club."  Manager Paul Jewell added: "Paul will be an excellent signing for us. He is very quick, strong n the air and can play anywhere in defence or midfield."  Scharner has 11 caps for Austria and played against England in the World Cup qualifier at Old Trafford - where he caught Wigan boss Paul Jewell's eye.  Birmingham made a move for Scharner in the autumn after the defender impressed in a friendly against Birmingham but Wigan then tabled a higher bid.  Wigan agreed a fee of around £2m for the centre-back, who could make his debut in the FA Cup match against Leeds on 4 January.
