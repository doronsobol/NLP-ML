He was one of seven men arrested after claims that items were taken from the Harrods box, owned by Mr Al Fayed's rival Tiny Rowland in 1995.  Scotland Yard decided not to press charges after the Crown Prosecution Service advised that there was no realistic prospect of a conviction.  The seven men included Mr Al Fayed's Director of Security John Macnamara, his Personal Assistant Mark Griffiths and bodyguard Paul Handley-Greaves.  The other men arrested and questioned about the safe box allegations were Harrods employees Colin Dalman and John Allen and a seventh unnamed man.  None will face any charges, Scotland Yard said.  In a statement, the Yard said: "On advice from the Crown Prosecution Service proceedings will not be instituted against the seven men arrested in connection with the Metropolitan Police investigation into allegations of theft at Harrods.  "The CPS advised that there is no realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offences.  " The Metropolitan Police is no longer actively investigating the allegations."  Mr Al Fayed accepted that Mr Rowland's box had been opened but said it had been done without his authority or knowledge.  The Harrods owner said in a statement: "Today's announcement by the police is the only outcome we had ever expected.  "It is regrettable it has taken 15 months to reach it but there can be no argument that the police investigation has been anything other than thorough and exhaustive."  "The collapse of criminal proceedings against us is a triumph for the truth."  Mr Rowland could not be contacted for comment.
