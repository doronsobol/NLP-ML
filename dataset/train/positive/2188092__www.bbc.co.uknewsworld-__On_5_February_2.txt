A Belgian runner has set a new world record by completing 365 marathon races in a year.  Stefaan Engels, dubbed "Marathon Man", began his challenge in Belgium a year ago and has since run a marathon every day across seven countries.  He crossed the finish line in the Spanish city of Barcelona after running 15,000km (9,569 miles) in a year.  "I don't regard my marathon year as torture. It is more like a regular job," the 49-year-old said.  He averaged about four hours to complete a marathon. He said his best time was 2 hours and 56 minutes.  Engels suffered from asthma as a child and had been told by doctors to avoid sport.  Before Engels, the record marathon man was Akinori Kusuda of Japan - who ran 52 races in a row at the age of 65 in 2009.
