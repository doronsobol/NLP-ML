Borgetti, 31, has agreed a two-year deal and Bolton will have to pay around Â£1m to his current club Pachuca.  "I can't wait to get started - I will take three weeks off to rest and be ready to make an impact on the Premiership," Borgetti said.  "This is a great honour for me to play for Bolton in the strongest league in the world."  Borgetti will be the first Mexican to play in the Premiership.  He is Mexico's joint all-time leading goalscorer with 35 goals and will add experience to Bolton's strikeforce.  Bolton boss Sam Allardyce said: "His pedigree is excellent but the Premiership is still unknown to him and he will have to be at his best to make the impact we are looking for.  "It is a massive challenge for both the player and the club and I do know he has the mental strength to make it a success in England."  Allardyce has endured a tricky close season, with all his targets proving difficult to pin down - so far he has only signed goalkeeper Ian Walker.  The Bolton boss has now joined up with his squad as they begin their tour in Thailand and Japan and is confident he will close the deal on one more signing before the end of the week.  "I have started early negotiations with a couple of players," said Allardyce.  "I remain hopeful of bringing at least one more signing in before the week is out. If there is a need to fly back to the UK then I'll have to do that."  Meanwhile, striker El-Hadji Diouf claims that he wants to see out his career at the Reebok Stadium after signing a four-year contract earlier this summer.  Senegal international Diouf said: "This is the best club I've been at.  "From the fantastic supporters to the chairman Phil Gartside, everyone makes me feel welcome.  "There is no other club I want to play for and I want to sign with the club for life."
