Angela Smith is one of the most famous names in British squash, and she was a top-ranked player for over two decades.  She’s won titles across the world for both herself and Great Britain – in fact she only ever lost twice while on international duty.  Angela was the first female player to turn professional, doing so at the age of 24.  By turning pro, she forced Great Britain to allow her to play for her country which previously only let amateurs play.  She was also one of the forerunners of the professional body WISPA, which governs the sport today.  She even remembers the day when Sir Stanley Matthews returned to the club in 1961.  And just as the city's supported her, she supports Stoke-on-Trent and sees it as the centre of her universe although she's coached right across the globe.  Even her school friends would say the former Number 1 was competitive playing at home: Angela often told her doubles partner to serve and then leave the court so she could get on with playing!  To hear more about Angela's career and her love for Stoke City, listen to the interview she gave in 2008 to BBC Radio Stoke's Matt Sandoz.  In this 30 minute interview, Angela reveals, among other things, her highs and lows in the game - and even the surprising fact that, although she's been British and World Champion, she thinks being named the BBC's Regional Sport Personality of the Year is the highlight of her career!
