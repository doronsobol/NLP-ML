Bloc Party drummer Matt Tong has hinted that the band face an uncertain future after they recently announced plans to take a lengthy break. The sticksman also admitted that he is unsure at this stage whether he will actually return to music.   "Unfortunately that is going to be it for the time being," he told the BBC's Subculture show in Stoke.   "We definitely need to have a break and gain a bit of perspective on life outside of the band. Hopefully if we do reconvene at some point in the future we'll be refreshed and have so many ideas to bring to what it is we do." His comments come after frontman Kele Okereke recently confirmed that the band will take a lengthy break after their current tour.  "I definitely don't think this will be the last you'll hear of the people who make up Bloc Party," Tong admitted.     "Kele is an insatiable workaholic and creating is something he is so connected to so you'll definitely hear from him again along with Russell (Lissack) and Gordon (Moakes) also.      "As for me I don't know, I wouldn't mind trying something else for a while."      The band, who are in the middle of mammoth UK tour, were due to perform at Newport Centre tonight (16 October) but have pulled the show after Lissack had to undergo a "medical procedure".     A statement on the band's website added: "Bloc Party have unfortunately been forced to cancel this Friday's Newport show as guitarist Russell Lissack has to undergo a medical procedure which, whilst not being serious, cannot be delayed until the end of the tour."
