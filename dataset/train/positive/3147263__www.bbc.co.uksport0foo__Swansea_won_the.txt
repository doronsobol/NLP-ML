Scott Sinclair insists he will continue to take Swansea City's penalties despite missing his first for the club against Manchester City.  England goalkeeper Joe Hart denied Sinclair's spot-kick in Sunday's clash, which the Swans eventually won 1-0.  Sinclair had scored all 13 previous penalties since his arrival at the Liberty Stadium in August 2010.  "I won't be shirking my responsibility. If we get another penalty then I'll be ready to take one," he said.  Hart, who tried to rattle Sinclair's focus before the penalty with some 'sledging', pulled off a fine one-handed save after six minutes to end the winger's successful run.  Sinclair, who scored two penalties in last season's Championship play-off win against Reading at Wembley, admits the attention given to his penalty technique and record makes it tougher to beat keepers from 12 yards out.  "He [Hart] was saying 'don't wait for me' before I took the penalty," revealed Sinclair.  "That didn't put me off at all, but he did well to save it.  "There's no doubt it's getting harder for me to score penalties because goalkeepers are doing their homework and studying videos.  "That's the challenge for me - to keep them guessing."  Despite being denied by his former England Under-21 team-mate, Sinclair will still be first in line to take a penalty should the Swans be awarded one at Fulham this weekend.  The 22-year-old, with seven goals to his name in the top flight this season, added: "There's always pressure on taking a penalty because you're expected to score.  "I'm not one to shy away from it - I've no problem in taking the next one.  "I've got the mental strength to remain positive.  "The gaffer [Brendan Rodgers] told me at half-time how important my penalties have been [for Swansea] - I've scored 13 from 14, so it's not that bad a record."
