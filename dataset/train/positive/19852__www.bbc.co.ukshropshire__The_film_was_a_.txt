Veteran actress Madhuri Dixit, who made a grand Bollywood comeback in Yash Raj Films' 2007 dance musical Aaja Nachle (meaning 'come let us dance') will be conferred with the prestigious Padmashri Award for her invaluable contribution to Indian cinema this month.  She then went on to act in box office hits like Ram Lakhan (1989), Parinda (1989), Tridev (1989), Kishen Kanhaiya (1990), Dil (1990), Saajan (1991), Beta (1992), Khalnayak (1993) and the all-time Bollywood smash hit, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun! (1994) and also Raja (1995). All received popular screenings in Shropshire.  Madhuri further reaffirmed her acting prowess in Yash Chopra's blockbuster Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), for which she won a Filmfare Best Actress Award.  But it was not until 2002 that Madhuri won global fame for her work in director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas,Â  in which she shared screen space with the likes of Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai.  Her hard work paid off in the form of the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress award that year.  In 2007, she made a grand Bollywood comeback in Aaja Nachle. Although the film did not any break UK box office records, Madhuri's work was still appreciated by fans and critics alike.  This month, Madhuri Dixit will receive the Padmashri Award, rightly deserved for a Bollywood diva who has carved a small niche for herself in the history of Bollywood.
