The court of appeal in Nigeria has ruled that the country's human rights panel does not have the power to summon former rulers of the country.  The court said on Wednesday that a law which would have empowered the rights panel to summon former leaders violated the Nigerian constitution.  Ironically, the court said that it was Mr Obasanjo who failed to modify the required 1966 military decree to conform to the constitution which he adopted in 1999.  Therefore the so-called Oputa panel had no power to compel anyone to conform to any orders it might give.  Three former military rulers - Mohammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, and Abdulsalam Abubakar - have repeatedly defied summonses to appear before the panel to answer allegations of rights abuses.  The panel, similar in scope to South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is expected to submit its findings to the Nigerian government within weeks.
