It was written to bring together every corner of Ireland.  The man who composed it - Phil Coulter - said he composed it because he loved hearing a combination of the Irish accents singing together.  Come the day    And come the hour    Come the power and the glory    We have come to answer    Our country's call...    From the four proud provinces of Ireland    Ireland, Ireland    Together standing tall    Shoulder to shoulder    We'll answer Ireland's call.     From the mighty    Glens of Antrim    From the rugged hills of Galway   From the walls of Limerick    And Dublin Bay    From the four proud provinces of Ireland    Hearts of steel    And heads unbowing   Vowing never to be broken   We will fight, until    We can fight no more...   For the four proud provinces of Ireland.
