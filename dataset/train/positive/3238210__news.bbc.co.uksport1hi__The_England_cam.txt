England coach Clive Woodward could barely contain his anger at the tactics employed by South Africa in Saturday's Test at Twickenham.  The hosts crushed their opponents 53-3 but sustained a number of injuries in the process and Woodward feels his players were deliberately taken out.  Jonny Wilkinson in particular was given a rough ride and it was a late challenge on him which saw Jannes Labuschagne dismissed in the 23rd minute.  He later left Twickenham with his arm in a sling but said: "I have had some x-rays and they don't show any breaks.  "But I am not going to know for another 24 or 48 hours what I have actually done. It's pretty painful."  Woodward said: "People have got to look at what went on off the ball. Jonny went off injured, but he was being targeted.  "It was a brutal Test match, if we are honest. I commend referee Paddy O'Brien for the way he handled it, and I commend the England players for their discipline.  "Everyone who was taken off went off because of injuries. I was just glad that we had one of the top referees in charge, and he kept the lid on it."  England players were repeatedly taken out off the ball, especially in tackle situations.  As well as Wilkinson, flanker Lewis Moody and scrum-half Matt Dawson went off injured, taking some of the gloss off a 7-try England victory.  Woodward paid tribute to his players as they kept their composure to inflict South Africa's worst-ever international defeat.  "There was a lot going on out there, and our self-control was magnificent. All the key guys in the team kept their control when they could have lost it," he said.  He added that "there was too much going on that wasn't acceptable" but feels there is "not much point" citing anyone.
