Campaigners have been fighting to keep Etruria station open but the Department of Transport said falling passenger numbers meant that it was not viable.  Since 2003, only two trains a day have used the station, near Stoke-on-Trent.  A spokesman for environmental group Transport 2000 said stations should be opening, not closing.  Services were withdrawn from the station in 2003 to allow engineering work on the West Coast Mainline.  The work meant the line was realigned away from the platform leaving a large gap between platform and train.  Work to remedy the problem would cost around Â£9m.  When the line reopened some services were restored but Central Trains continued to use road transport instead.  The nearest stations are at Longport and Stoke-on-Trent, just over a mile away.
