Shane Williams scores for Wales against Ireland in the Six Nations Wales' record try-scorer Shane Williams has admitted he considered quitting rugby in 2002, saying he'd "had a gutsful" of the sport at that time. At the time Williams suffered a series of hamstring injuries and was not in coach Steve Hansen's plans. Williams told Wales on Sunday: "I was fed up and felt like quitting. I wasn't playing for Wales and I wasn't happy. "There were times when I thought it wasn't worth it and I was convinced I wouldn't play for Wales again." Can you define Shane Williams' contribution to the sport? But instead of walking away from the game, Williams became determined to return to the big stage and ended up starring for Wales at the 2003 World Cup before becoming a 2005 British & Irish Lion. Williams, whose 41st Wales try helped them beat France and claim the Grand Slam, said: "You have to be stubborn and bloody-minded. I've had injuries, lost form and not been picked. "I felt hard done by when Steve Hansen wouldn't pick me, but now I know I wasn't good enough and wasn't fit enough. "I'd torn my hamstring four times in a season and there were reasons for that. I was a bit immature, but bucked my ideas up because I wanted to play for Wales again. "Some players always get picked, even when they aren't playing well. I have never been one of those. I have to play well or I won't be picked."
