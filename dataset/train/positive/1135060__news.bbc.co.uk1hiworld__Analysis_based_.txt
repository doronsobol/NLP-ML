The records, obtained by the New York Times newspaper, say that Arafat died from a stroke that stemmed from an unknown condition.  But Israeli newspaper Haaretz says the records point to him dying from poisoning, Aids or an infection.  Both newspapers say the records, which have been withheld by senior Palestinian officials and Mr Arafat's widow until now, show that doctors could not agree on the cause of the 75-year-old's death.  The New York Times says the records show that it was highly unlikely that Mr Arafat died from poisoning or Aids.  The Haaretz report cites an Israeli Aids experts as saying that many of Mr Arafat's symptoms were typical of the disease.  Another senior Israeli doctor quoted by Haaretz describes the death as "a classic case of food poisoning."  Mr Arafat's medical records are set to be published in an Israeli book next week.  "There are three possible causes of death: infection from a germ that poisoned the blood, Aids or poisoning from a dinner at his Ramallah headquarters on October 12, 2004," Avi Isacharov, one of the book's authors, told the AFP news agency.  Speculation on the cause of Arafat's death has continued with many Palestinians believing that he was poisoned by Israel.  Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom denied any Israeli involvement in the former Palestinian leader's death.  "The time has come for the Palestinians to put an end to this conspiracy theory. This new theory that Israel is responsible for the death of Arafat is absolutely nonsense," he said.  Yasser Arafat's nephew, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nasser al-Kidwa, has said the late Palestinian leader's medical file does not allay suspicions that he may have died of "unnatural causes".  But senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said the French doctors should publish their report in full to put an end to the rumours.
