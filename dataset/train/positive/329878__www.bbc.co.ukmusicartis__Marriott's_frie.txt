Marriott's friend Annabel, an ex-student from the Italia Conti, came up with the band's distinctive name after commenting that they all had "small faces"; the name stuck in part because they were all (apart from Winston) small (none being over 5&#160;ft 6 in tall), and the term "face" in English mod culture was the name given to a well-known and respected mod.

Small Faces were an English Mod band formed in 1965 by Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones, and Jimmy Winston (who was soon replaced by Ian McLagan). Heavily influenced by American rhythm and blues, they later evolved into a psychedelic act before disbanding in 1969.  Despite the fact that they were only together four years, Small Faces' music output from the mid to late sixties remains as notable British mod and psychedelic music of that era. Allmusic refers to them as "the best English band never to make it big in America". Small Faces were awarded the Ivor Novello Outstanding Contribution to British Music "Lifetime Achievement" award in 1996.
