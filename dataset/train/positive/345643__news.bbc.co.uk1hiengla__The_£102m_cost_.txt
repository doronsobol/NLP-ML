If approved, the £102m link road is to be paid for by Macquarie Infrastructure Group - owner of road operator Midland Expressway, which runs the M6 Toll.  The road would be free to use and it is hoped it will cut traffic from Shropshire and Wales travelling through nearby Staffordshire villages.  The plans will go on display in Cheslyn Hay, Featherstone and Essington.  The road, which is expected to be built by 2012, would connect M54 Junction 1, M6 J11a and M6 Toll T8 in south Staffordshire.
