Dance act Spiller, who famously kept Posh Spice off the number one spot, have won two prizes in the Ericsson Muzik Awards.  The band's chart-topping track, Groove Jet, won the awards for Best Single and Best Ibiza Tune at the annual dance awards at The Arches in London.  Basement Jaxx, who have enjoyed an excellent 1999 and 2000, also scooped two awards. The duo walked off with the awards for Best Band and Best Live Act. Felix and Simon started out as a punk garage band before news of their excellent sets in Brixton began to spread and they got a recording contract with XL Records. Controversial rapper Eminem won the award for best album, with his The Marhsall Mathers LP. The winners were chosen by readers of Muzik magazine. Spiller hit the headlines earlier this year when the band were involved in a head-to-head fight with Posh Spice for the number one spot.  Victoria Beckham, singing with the Truesteppers and Dane Bowers, heavily promoted her single with record signings in stores across the UK. But the previously-unknown Spiller was embraced as the nation's favourite single that week and took the top spot. The irrepresible Craig David surprisingly failed to win an award and was beaten to the MTV Best Video award by Moby, for his song Natural Blues.
