BBC Radio 7 Newsletter - Friday 25th March     The Selection  Classic Comedy  Comedy Zone  Comedy Club  7 Drama  7th Dimension  Crime & Thrillers  Fact And Fiction  Children's  Stories For All The Family  And finally        Hello again     It was with more than a little nostalgia that yesterday evening I began to draft today's newsletter, knowing it would be the last one I’ll be sending from Radio 7, as next Friday will be our final day on-air before we relaunch as BBC Radio 4 Extra on Saturday 2nd April.      What a long and fascinating journey it’s been so far. It all began in March 2002, when I was invited to create a new archive digital speech radio station, known then as "Network Z". With the assistance of just two newly recruited producers plus an archive researcher - and facing a blank sheet of paper - I have to admit it was a somewhat daunting task. Back then there were a few naysayers shaking their heads as they posed the question " Do you really believe you'll get an audience - who wants to listen to old radio programmes anyway?"     Eight years on - with a name change from BBC 7 along the way - Radio 7 now has an audience of around a million enjoying our " old (and new!) radio programmes". And with the imminent re-branding of our station, we hope to build an even bigger audience by continuing to bring you a great range of radio entertainment from the archive - and more.      Our first evening of BBC 7 programmes was broadcast on the eve of our official launch on 14th December 2002. With Paul Merton as the host, it was simulcast on our sister station, Radio 4 and it felt exhilarating.      And now, by linking up more with Radio 4, as 4 Extra we have, in a way, almost come full circle.      It’s certainly been uplifting to hear recent trails on Radio 4 show-casing our re-branded network. The trail I heard this morning in the Today programme did make me smile, when it ended with the waspish voice of Kenneth Williams riposting " Life is short - so let's get on with it!"      And we certainly are getting on with it. Our 17-strong team of producers, broadcast assistant/researchers, archivist and schedule planner have been working all hours in the past few weeks to clear more new programmes resulting in what I think is an excellent schedule for Radio 4 Extra.      Last week I gave you news snippets of some of the comedy and drama we’ve got lined up, and next week I will be revealing more.      But now on to delights you can look forward to in the final week of  Radio 7:          The Selection   Comedy Controller   Justin Moorhouse   Justin Moorhouse reveals his comedy influences and chooses these comic delights: Knowing Me Knowing You (22.12.92), Ken Dodd's Palace of Laughter (3.9.87), On The Town With The League of Gentlemen (6.11.97), Ross Noble Goes Global - South Africa (18.4.02), Radio Shuttleworth (with Vanessa Feltz) (24.11.98) and Listen to Les (18.3.95).
