Ten fire engines and other specialist appliances were sent to the Frogs Hole Farm in Maidenbower, near Crawley, following a 999 call at 1430 GMT.  The fire was brought under control two hours later, but most of the roof at the back of the pub collapsed, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said.  A spokesman said no-one was hurt and fire crews would remain at the scene.  The Red Cross victim support unit was asked to attend.
