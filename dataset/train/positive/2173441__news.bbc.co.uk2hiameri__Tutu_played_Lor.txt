He will take part in two productions of "Guantanamo - honour-bound to defend freedom", over the weekend.  He will play Lord Justice Steyn, a judge who questions the legal justification of the detention regime.  Once a leading campaigner against apartheid, Archbishop Tutu is a vocal critic of the Guantanamo system.  Now he is taking the unusual step of agreeing to take part in a play which portrays the plight of the British nationals being held without trial along with hundreds of others suspected of being linked with terror organisations including al-Qaeda.  After each performance, Archbishop Tutu will participate in a question and answer session with the audience.  The play, which has drawn warm reviews from New York critics, is a damning indictment of the Bush administration's policies.  Archbishop Tutu's involvement comes at a highly sensitive political time with the US presidential election now just weeks away.
