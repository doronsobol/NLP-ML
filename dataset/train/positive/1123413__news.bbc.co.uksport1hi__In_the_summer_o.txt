Bristol Rovers have been rocked by a transfer request from star striker Jason Roberts, report BBC Radio Bristol.  Roberts, who has two years left on his current deal, handed in his written transfer request on Wednesday night.  The 22-year-old who joined Rovers in August 1998 for £250,000 bagged 22 goals last season but was disappointed after the club missed out on promotion.  Bristol Rovers vice-chairman Geoff Dunford said: "Unless we receive an offer meeting our valuation he's not going anywhere.  "We have yet to receive acceptable offers."  Rovers will value Roberts at around the £2.5m mark.
