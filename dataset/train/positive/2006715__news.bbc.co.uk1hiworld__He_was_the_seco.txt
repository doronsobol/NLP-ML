The last known survivor of a group of German army officers who tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944 has died aged 90, his family says.  Philipp von Boeselager provided the explosives used to pack a briefcase planted under a table in the Nazi leader's East Prussia headquarters.  But the briefcase was moved behind one of the oak table's wooden legs, and Hitler escaped with only slight wounds.  Most of the plotters were executed, but Mr Von Boeselager escaped detection.  Among those executed - just hours after the assassination attempt - was Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who planted the briefcase and after whom the plot was named.  Mr Von Boeselager died overnight on Thursday, his family said.
