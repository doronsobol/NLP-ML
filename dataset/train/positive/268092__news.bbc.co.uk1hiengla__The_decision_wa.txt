The decision was taken to close the City Road studios and relocate to a smaller purpose-built complex housing a newsroom and studio, resulting in the loss of up to 30 jobs.

The company is also moving out of its Newcastle city centre base, where it began 45 years ago as one of ITV's first regional broadcasters.  The broadcaster says it is investing Â£6m in a new production centre near the giant MetroCentre complex in Gateshead.  Tyne Tees currently employs 200 people across sites on Tyneside, Teesside, Wearside and in London.  Managing director Graeme Thompson said: "This is a major investment by ITV in the North East.  "The prospect of moving from our old site to a production centre designed for the 21st Century is very exciting.  "Obviously we are going to be sad about leaving City Road after 45 years. It has produced classics such as The Tube."  Staff at the station mounted a protest over feared cuts after regulator Ofcom said it proposed to allow ITV companies in the English regions to cut their output by one-and-a-half hours a week.
