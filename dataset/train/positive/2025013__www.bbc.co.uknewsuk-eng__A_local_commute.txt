Eighteen people were injured when two trains were in collision at a railway station.  Devon and Cornwall Police said the crash at Plymouth Railway Station was a "low impact collision" and they were not aware of any serious injuries.  Emergency services were called to the scene, following the crash at about 15:35 BST on Sunday.  Eight casualties were going to Derriford Hospital but all were stable, South Western Ambulance said.  "At this stage we believe that a moving train drove into the back of a stationary train on platform 6 at the station, and we are currently looking into the circumstances to determine how this happened", British Transport Police said.  The trains involved were the 15:42 Plymouth to Paddington high speed train and the 13:39 Penzance to Exeter train, a spokesperson for Great Western Railway said.  "Investigations are still ongoing, but eyewitnesses have suggested the speed of the collision was less than 10mph."  Police have advised people to avoid the station if possible, and said delays were likely for passengers travelling through the Plymouth area.
