Founded on the strong but often tumultuous relationship between friends Carl Barât and Pete Doherty, The Libertines have enjoyed fame and infamy since they came together in 1997. The success of their 2002 debut album Up the Bracket, produced by Mick Jones of The Clash, followed on from a wave of interest in new indie guitar bands like The Strokes and The Vines.  The Libertines were championed heavily by the NME, but as their notoriety grew, so did Doherty's problems with drug addiction. This led to the breakdown of his friendship with Barât. Doherty even spent time in prison for breaking into Barât's home. Finding it difficult to play together, the two protagonists concentrated on their respective side projects, Barât with Dirty Pretty Things and Doherty with Babyshambles. The Libertines officially split at the end of 2004 with Doherty noticeably absent for much of that year.  Attempts to reunite the band have since followed, with Barât and Doherty patching their differences to temporarily play odd one-off shows, most notably their 2007 turn at the Hackney Empire in London.  Earlier this year they officially announced that they would be reforming to play Reading and Leeds festivals much to the delight of their avid fans. An impromptu teaser show at the Boogaloo in North London saw them play many favourites, alluding to what should be a greatest hits show on the Main stage. Expect emotions to be running high when Doherty and Barât join forces once more.
