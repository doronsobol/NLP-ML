Asked whether he thought Mr Clinton was fit to be president, Mr McCurry, who had maintained his silence on presidential issues since his resignation in October, said: "I have enormous doubts because of the recklessness of his behaviour.  "The nature of this particular affair and then the way he did conceal it really does raise some very profound troubling matters.  Asked about the president's sex life, he said people close to Mr Clinton had spent a year relying on what appeared to be a direct denial of scandal.  "I did not believe that there was a tortured definition of sex lurking behind that denial," said Mr McCurry.  "I couldn't imagine that he would put himself in that kind of jeopardy when there was a whole army of inquisitors out there," he added.  The former spokesman said that direct conversation on the Monica Lewinsky affair had been avoided to prevent presidential aides being subpoenaed.  But Mr McCurry said he had been assured by the president that "everything would turn out alright".  He said that he had preferred to remain "unknowing" rather than give the press information that night be unreliable.
