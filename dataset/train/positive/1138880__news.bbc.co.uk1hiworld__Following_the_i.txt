Following the incident, German police contacted many of the known 2,000+ German hooligans to warn them they would be arrested if they travelled to upcoming matches in France.

The authorities believe right-wing neo-nazi groups may try to stir up trouble at the match in Montpellier.  The action follows the clashes involving German hooligans in Lens a week ago which left a French policeman in a coma.  More than 2000 German soccer hooligans are known to the police. Many of them have been contacted individually and warned against travelling to France.  The most violent so-called "category C" hooligans could be put in jail as a preventive measure even if they have not committed any crime.  Internet sites used by right-wing extremists have been advising hooligans where to meet.  German politicians are considering giving the courts more powers to deal with football violence. One proposal is that convicted hooligans should be banned from travel for five years.  A recent survey showed that 90% of Germans favoured the courts accelerating the prosecution of hooligans in the same way that French courts do.  "I don't understand why German justice authorities make so little use of the option to speed up prosecution," said the Family and Youth Affairs Minister Claudia Nolte.
