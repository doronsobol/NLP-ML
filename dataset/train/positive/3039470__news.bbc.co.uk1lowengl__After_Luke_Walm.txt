Luke Walmsley, 14, died of a single stab wound after an incident at the Birkbeck School at North Somercotes near Louth in Lincolnshire on 4 November.  Contributions to the Luke Walmsley Sports Foundation have already reached £4,000.  Luke's father, Paul, said his son loved sport and the family felt a sports foundation was the best way for him to be remembered.  Mr Walmsley said he was touched to receive a letter of condolence from rugby coach Clive Woodward and the England Rugby World Cup squad after his son's death.  "All the England players and management sent their thoughts to us in a letter - and it arrived a few minutes after England won the Rugby World Cup," he said.  The foundation aims to raise £1m to build a news sports facility in the North Somercotes area.  Mr Walmsley said his son liked snooker, ice skating, swimming, judo, rugby, tennis, squash, motor biking, sailing, rock climbing and football.  "We want everyone to remember Luke and we thought the best way was to set up a sports foundation, he said.  "There has been a tremendous response so far and the cheques are still coming through the letter box."  A 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with Luke's murder.
