Julian Barratt is chiefly known as one half of surreal comedy duo The Mighty Boosh (alongside Noel Fielding), which first exploded onto the Edinburgh Fringe in the 1998 Edinburgh Festival and has since become a huge cult hit on radio and TV.  Barratt's first notable television appearance came alongside Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson in black comedy Asylum (for the Paramount Comedy Channel), but the idea for the Boosh came to him and Fielding while they participated in Stewart Lee's Edinburgh Show King Dong v Moby Dick, playing a giant penis and a giant whale.  After together winning a 1998 Perrier Best Newcomer Award, the pair earned a BBC London radio series (produced by Danny Wallace) that quickly transferred to Radio 4.  Eventually a TV version of the Boosh appeared on BBC Three, where its unique brand of surrealism has won a devoted and still-growing fan-base.  Barratt has mixed up his work with other roles, including a scene-stealing turn in British film Lucky Break and most notably, co-starring in media satire Nathan Barley as the frustrated writer Dan Ashcroft.  Shy and self-deprecating in interviews, Barratt can come across as a reluctant star but he's become a highly sought-after performer.  As of 2007 he and Fielding are preparing to unleash a third TV series of the Boosh.
