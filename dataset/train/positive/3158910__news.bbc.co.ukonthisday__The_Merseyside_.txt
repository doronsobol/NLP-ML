The Merseyside police Operational Support Division was deployed into the area to restore order and were later criticised by community leaders and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Derek Warlock for their "over zealous and provocative tactics" which included the drumming of batons on riot shields.

Police in riot gear have closed off areas of Liverpool and London tonight in efforts to contain continued outbreaks of violence and vandalism.  In a second night of disturbances in Peckham, south London, gangs of youths have been throwing petrol bombs and setting shops alight.  A major fire at a carpet warehouse off Peckham High Street has been reported.  At least ten people are believed to have been injured in the Liverpool district of Toxteth, including three police officers, after gangs stoned cars and set them on fire.  The Liverpool violence follows angry protests over a court case involving four local men earlier today.  Proceedings were disrupted at Liverpool magistrates court by a large crowd of demonstrators protesting against the charging of four black defendants in relation to a stabbing investigation.  As protesters left the court several shouted at police: "We'll see you tonight."  An hour later trouble broke out in the Toxteth area. At least five vehicles including a mail van were pelted with stones and their occupants dragged out. The vehicles were overturned and torched.  Missiles were also thrown at the police station in Hope Street, the headquarters of Toxteth community policing.  Police say the violence has now subsided and crowds have dispersed although small gangs are still roaming the side streets.  Local community leaders have visited the area hoping to calm the atmosphere but police remain on alert. A spokesman said: "It's a warm night and we don't know which way it's going to go."
