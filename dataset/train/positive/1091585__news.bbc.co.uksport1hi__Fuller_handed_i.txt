The Jamaica international turned down a lucrative contract extension earlier this season and will be able to leave Deepdale on a free transfer next year.  "We have to be realistic," chairman Derek Shaw told the club's website.  "There is no point holding on to a player who is not 110 per cent behind the club and his team-mates."  Manager Craig Brown said: "I am naturally very disappointed. Apparently, Ricardo is very impatient to get into the bigger money.  "It is a blow to lose one of the better players, but we will press on as a matter of urgency to find a suitable replacement.  "As things stand, there are no bids on the table for Ricardo, but obviously we would expect some interest now the board have accepted his request."
