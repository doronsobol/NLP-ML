However it remains open as a taxiway and a helicopter airstrip.

The Cross runway, which crosses the main airport runway at the UK's sixth largest airport, opened with the original buildings in 1939.  It shut three years ago and is surplus to requirements as it cannot be used at the same time as the main runway.  In September plans for a second runway to cope with a predicted three-fold increase in passenger numbers by 2030 were scrapped.  Birmingham International Airport (BIA) said it had joined a "very select band of airports" around the world which had shut unwanted runways.  John Morris, BIA's head of corporate affairs, said: "Although it was of great use in the past it was also a cause of annoyance to local residents and in recent years it was only used in exceptional circumstances."  Following the scrapping of the second runway scheme, an extension to the existing runway is planned, which could be operational in time for the 2012 London Olympic Games, the airport said.  Mr Morris added the airport expected to announce a planning application for expanding the runway soon.
