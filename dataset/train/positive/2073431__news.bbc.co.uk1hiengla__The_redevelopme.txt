Developers Mace pulled out of a £23m plan in November to renovate the leisure site which has been derelict since it was closed in 2000.  A mail shot is due to be sent to developers who have already expressed an interest in the property.  The council is hoping expressions of interest will be lodged by 8 April, with a shortlist made on 13 April.  Interviews and bids for the development are to be made to the council by the middle of June.  Councillor Alan Hockridge said: "We are seeking a development partner who can put forward a viable commercial leisure scheme to create a year-round attraction."  Mace had wanted to build a hotel, leisure complex, multi-screen cinema and restaurants in the £23m development.  There has been a pool on the seafront at Weston since the 1930s, but declining visitor numbers in the 1990s saw the council vote to close it.
