The wins that year came against full-time professional players, whereas most of the Arsenal team had full-time jobs.

Manager Vic Akers hailed Arsenal's first Uefa Women's Cup triumph as "the greatest moment in our history".  "It's especially precious to win the Uefa Cup this season. Umea are a great side and we had to put in a massive amount of effort," said Akers.  "It was very difficult to hang on towards the end, when people were getting tense, but we got the result."  As well as the bar and post Arsenal also had goalkeeper Emma Byrne to thank for a second sterling performance.  England right-back Alex Scott's first-leg goal won the tie but Republic of Ireland keeper Byrne was the true hero.  Akers added: "Emma was fantastic in both games. Her handling was superb in the first leg, she was a our best performer, and she has done it again for us today."  Disappointed Umea coach Andree Jeglertz said: "We could have won both games but we weren't sharp enough in the penalty area.  "I felt we were the better side but Arsenal stopped our best players in a marvellous way and they have won the Cup - so they are the best team in Europe."  Umea were attempting to win the Cup for a record third time but they were thwarted by a determined Gunners side that became the first British team to lift the trophy.  After the game, Akers and some of his players made a dash from Boreham Wood FC to the Emirates Stadium in time for Arsenal's Premiership meeting with Fulham.  "I've had a text from the men's team congratulating us," said Akers, kit man to Arsene Wenger's side.  "And I'm sure the crowd at the Emirates will give the girls a big ovation. They deserve it - this is the greatest moment in our history."
