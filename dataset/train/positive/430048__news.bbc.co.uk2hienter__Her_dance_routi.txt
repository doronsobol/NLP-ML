Her dance routines had been reworked to accommodate her medical condition, with slower costume changes and longer breaks introduced between sections of the show to conserve her strength.

The Showgirl Homecoming tour will reach Wembley on 2 and 3 January 2007, with tickets going on sale this Friday.  The Australian was forced to stop working in May 2005 to receive surgery and chemotherapy to fight the disease.  Her act has been changed to reduce the number of fast costume changes, because she is still not fully fit.  "I'm as prepared as I can be, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to do everything that I did before," the 38-year-old said in an interview broadcast on Sky One on Sunday.  She said that she no longer performed so many awkward dance routines, but admitted quick switches of outfits were still "really stressful".  Minogue went on: "There's a whole other world backstage that happens, six times throughout the show.  "So I said, 'You know what, maybe we won't have quick changes, we'll have slow changes. And maybe even a little chair.'"  She was about to start the Australian leg of the Showgirl tour when she was told she had cancer.  The dates in Australia have been rescheduled to take place before the UK concerts, and will begin at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 11 November.  Minogue's record company, Parlophone, has also said she is working on material which could be released in 2007.
