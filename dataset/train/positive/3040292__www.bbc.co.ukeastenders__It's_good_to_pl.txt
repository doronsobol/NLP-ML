A new website was launched in December 2009 as part of the EastEnders 25th anniversary celebrations with the aim of giving you lots more video, behind the scenes features and gossip, as well as all the news, previews and programme highlights we previously offered.  Unfortunately, we've had to remove a lot of our old content, including some of the games, the webcam, Your Say, the Family Tree, Danielle's Diary and the map of Walford. However, we have plans to launch new improved features during 2010.  Catch up on recent episodes with video, photos, and a weekly review of the show.  Preview the next episode with our exclusive video clips, get a sneak peek at a script, photos from upcoming episodes, plus gossip and spoilers on the Insider blog.  We've had to remove all our classic clips. Some of these will be added back into the site as part of the celebrations for our 25th anniversary.  You can see many classic clips on the EastEnders YouTube channel.
