Steve Finnan is equally adept in defence or a midfield role and could be employed in either position in Japan and Korea.  A natural attacking player, his ability to cross the ball was crucial as his side burst into the tournament against the odds.  He started off as little more than a substitute but started the final three qualifying games and looks a key part of Mick McCarthy's plans.  The 25-year-old moved to Fulham from Notts County back in November 1998 for Â£600,000.  He has only got his name on the score-sheet once for the Republic.
