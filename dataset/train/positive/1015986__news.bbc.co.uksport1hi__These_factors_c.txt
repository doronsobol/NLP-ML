These factors contributed to low attendances; in the 2005–06 season, Juventus' average attendance was 35,880.

The Turin outfit were formed in 1897 and have since become one of the most successful and famous clubs in the world.  BBC Sport presents all you need to know about the Serie A giants.  Juventus are 109 years old, making them one of the oldest league clubs in Italy.  The bianconeri (White-blacks - their home kit) play at the 67,229-capacity Stadio Delle Alpi, which they share with city rivals Torino.  The club moved from their old ground, Stadio Comunale, to their new base in 1990, built also as a venue for the World Cup.  Stadio Delle Alpi, however, has proved unpopular with fans because of its location, on the outskirts of the city, and because of the poor visibility of the pitch from some parts of the ground.  Juventus have bought their ground from the council and plan to build a new stadium on the site which will have a reduced capacity, believed to be 35,000. They aim to have it ready for the start of the 2007/2008 season.  Their first European Cup success in 1985 was overshadowed by the tragic events at Heysel Stadium where 39 fans died after a stadium wall collapsed, trapping hundreds fleeing crowd trouble on the terraces.  The game went ahead and Juventus won 1-0 after Michel Platini's penalty.  They won their second title, now under the guise of the Champions League, in 1996 when they beat Ajax 4-2 on penalties - with Fabrizio Ravanelli scoring for Juve as 90 minutes and extra time finished at 1-1.  Juve appeared in the next two finals, but could not repeat the success of 1996. They lost 3-1 to Borussia Dortmund the following year, before a Pedrag Mijatovic goal for Real Madrid saw off the Italians in 1997.  They were back in the final in 2003, but this time Serie A rivals AC Milan stood in the way, losing 3-2 on penalties.  Last season, Juve were defeated by eventual champions Liverpool at the quarter-final stage.  Many great players have graced the black and white shirt for La Vecchia Signora (The Old Lady).  They include Argentine Omar Sivori, Wales' John Charles, Frenchmen Michel Platini, Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry and Italian greats Dino Zoff, Paolo Rossi, Marco Tardelli and Gianluca Vialli to name but a few.  The current crop include some of the biggest names in world football:  Gianluigi BUFFON (goalkeeper)   Buffon became the most expensive goalkeeper in the world when he moved from Parma to Juve in 2001 for a transfer record fee of £33m.  However, he bounced back to wear the number one jersey at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004.  Brazil legend Pele named Buffon as one of the top 125 living footballers in 2004.  Gianluca ZAMBROTTA (defender)   Many regard Zambrotta as one of the toughest and most consistent defenders in the world.  The 29-year-old Italy star is also very versatile and has been utilised on the right and left wing by former Juve coach Marcelo Lippi and current commander-in-chief Fabio Capello.  He has won three Serie A titles with the Turin outfit and signed a new deal last year that will keep him at Juve until 2010.  EMERSON (midfielder)   The 29-year-old Brazilian has become one of the key members of the Juve squad since joining the Italian giants from rivals Roma in 2004.  Capello has already seen Emerson and Vieira form a formidable partnership, and with the arrival of the Frenchman it has allowed the Brazilian to roam forward more often.  Emerson helped Roma to their first league title for 18 years in 2001 and was part of Juventus' championship-winning squad last season.  Patrick VIEIRA (midfielder)   The performance of the 29-year-old France international against Arsenal will be of added interest.  He was part of a strong midfield at Arsenal, but many would argue that he has joined a far stronger unit at Juve, with the likes of Brazil's Emerson and Pavel Nedved plying their trade at the Stadio Delle Alpi.  Of the major honours, only the European Cup is missing from his locker.  Vieira won the Premiership and FA Cup double with Arsenal in 1998 and 2002.  He also helped France to World Cup success in 1998 and the European Championship in 2000.  David TREZEGUET (striker)   The 28-year-old made a huge mark on world football before joining Juventus from Monaco in 2000.  The tall and pacy forward, along with current club team-mate Vieira, helped France to the 1998 World Cup and then scored the golden goal against Italy that gave his country the Euro 2000 title.  Trezeguet has scored over 30 goals for France and is closing in on the 100-goal mark for Juventus.  Fabio Capello is one of the most sought-after managers in football.  The 59-year-old, who played for Juventus as a winger in the 1970s, made his mark at AC Milan.  He led the side to four league titles in five years and guided them to European Cup glory in 1994 with the 4-0 humbling of Barcelona.  Capello then moved to Real Madrid during the 1996/1997 season, leading the Spanish giants to La Liga title.  He returned to Milan for a season before moving to Roma where he guided them to the 2001 Italian league title.  Success continued when he took charge of Juve at the start of the last campaign. The Turin side won the Serie A championship by seven points from Milan.  Capello is set to move again at the end of the season, and has already expressed an interest in managing the England national team.
