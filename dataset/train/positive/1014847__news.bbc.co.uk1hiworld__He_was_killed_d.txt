It was unclear whether Maulvi Jalil Ahmed had been targeted or was the victim of a stray bullet in a shootout between rival gangs.  Mr Ahmed had been a Muslim cleric in Quetta for six years, police said.  Mr Mutawakil has recently rejoined the Afghan political process and is running in September's parliamentary election.  Pakistani security officials told the Reuters news agency the killing of Mr Ahmed was not political.  Quetta police superintendent, Pervez Zahoor, said: "An incident occurred between two groups last night, we also know that a passer-by, who has been identified as Jalil Ahmed, was caught in crossfire."  The south-western city, on the Afghan border, has a number of political and tribal rivalries.  Mr Mutawakil, who was held for three years, first by the Americans and then under house arrest in Kabul, is running in Kandahar for a seat in the Afghan parliament.  He is one beneficiary of the Afghan government's attempt to rehabilitate certain Taleban figures.  Mr Mutawakil is unapologetic about many aspects of Taleban rule but does admit that Osama Bin Laden and his followers brought suffering to the country.  He also says he now approves of girls' education, so long as it is in keeping with Afghan culture.
