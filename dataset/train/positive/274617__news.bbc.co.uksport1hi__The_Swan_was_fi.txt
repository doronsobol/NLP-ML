Oldham mascot Chaddy the Owl has had his beak rapped by police after getting into a scrap with a rival during a match.  Chaddy appeared to launch an unprovoked attack on Blackpool's Bloomfield Bear, pulling off his boots and hurling them into the crowd.  The incident left spectators at Saturday's FA Cup clash both shocked and amused, while fuming Blackpool officials want the mascot banned from Bloomfield Road.  Blackpool press officer Matthew Williams said: "I was in the press box and they were play-fighting, when Chaddy waded in and seemed to be kicking 10 bells out of Bloomfield Bear."  But Chaddy, double winner of the Mascot Grand National, insisted he was the innocent party, claiming the bear was trying to damage his beak.  He said: "Ninety per cent of mascots are top guys, but some of them think if they can floor Chaddy the Owl they can be in the newspapers."  It's not the first time mascots have been in trouble for fighting.  Cyril the Swan once received a £1,000 fine for ripping off the head of Millwall's Zampa the Lion and drop-kicking it into the crowd.  On another occasion, Wolves mascot Wolfie took on all of Bristol City's three pigs, while Bury's Robbie the Bobby was sent off for 'mooning' at fans and ripping the ear of a fellow mascot.  One thing's for sure, next month's return clash between Oldham and Blackpool at Bloomfield Road won't be the faint-hearted - not if you're in a giant furry suit, at any rate.
