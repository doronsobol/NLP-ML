On 8 April 2005, Norwegian police arrested a suspect in connection with the theft, but the paintings remained missing and it was rumored that they had been burned by the thieves to destroy evidence.

Police say they are optimistic they will now recover the works.  The two paintings, jointly worth about $19m (Â£10.4m), were stolen in August in broad daylight at the Munch Museum in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.  The two paintings have not been recovered and are believed to be too well-known to be resold.  "The police are optimistic that the investigation will produce results and that the pictures will be brought back to the Munch Museum," Oslo police said in a statement.  The man arrested is said to be in his 30s. He will be questioned and jailed over the weekend, Reuters news agency reports.
