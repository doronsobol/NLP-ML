Mika Hakkinen has been relegated from second to fourth place on the grid for the US Grand Prix after jumping a red light in the final practice session.  Race stewards made the decision after receiving a report that the Finn left the pit lane when the exit lights were red.  Hakinnen was stripped of his quickest qualifying time and his next best lap leaves him behind the Williams BMW duo of Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya.  Schumacher will now start the race at Indianapolis alongside his brother Michael at the front of the grid.  Hakkinen's preparation for the race has been far from ideal.  He hit the barriers during the warm-up but walked away unhurt. The Finn careered off the track, over the grass and into the metal barriers just a minute before the warm-up was scheduled to finish. But he emerged unscathed and will take his place on the front row of the grid alongside Michael Schumacher when the race starts. A lively session had earlier been interrupted when Montoya sustained a blown engine. The Colombian, who won his maiden Grand Prix at Imola two weeks ago, suffered the problem just eight minutes into the session. Barrichello drove his Ferrari into a gravel trap and the German spun his car. Ralf Schumacher recorded the fastest lap, timed at one minute 13.912 seconds, ahead of David Coulthard, Hakkinen and Michael Schumacher. Both Williams drivers have experienced problems with their car in the build-up to Sunday's race at the Indianapolis Speedway. And though he went fastest on Sunday morning, Ralf insisted: "It's going to be a difficult race for us".
