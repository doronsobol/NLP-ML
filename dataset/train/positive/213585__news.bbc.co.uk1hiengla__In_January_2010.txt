A college in Staffordshire has unveiled its new £60m campus.  Newcastle-Under-Lyme College held a public open day on Saturday to showcase its new facilities at a site in the town's Knutton Lane.  The campus includes an auditorium with seating capacity for 200 people, a sports centre, beauty salon and spa that will be open to non-students too.  College Principal Karen Dobson said she hoped it would be used by the community and appeal to new students as well.
