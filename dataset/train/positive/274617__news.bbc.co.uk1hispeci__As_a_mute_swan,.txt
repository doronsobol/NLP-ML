As a mute swan, he does not give interviews.

With a pop single already behind him, Swansea City FC's giant mascot Cyril the Swan, will take to the stage at Swansea's Grand Theatre.  Robson and Jerome have done it, so has Kylie Minogue, now Cyril the Swan is set to combine careers in both music and acting as his webbed feet tread the boards in the pantomime Aladdin.  Stage fright is unlikely to be a problem when he is waiting in the wings as Cyril is used to performing in front of large crowds at the Vetch Field.  But, if his acting career is to be a success, Aladdin's director may require Cyril to give a more muted performance than usual.  Swansea City commercial director Mike Lewis says Cyril will be "naughty but nice".  Swansea City fans recently gave a clear verdict on their favourite aspect of their club.  A supporters survey criticised catering and ticket arrangements, but 95% approved of Cyril's antics, even though he has been banned from the touchline during games.
