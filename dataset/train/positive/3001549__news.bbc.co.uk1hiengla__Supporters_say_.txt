Supporters say that the new buildings take into account the modern needs of the police better than the 60s/70s building, and that another advantage is that the old buildings can be sold for income or redeveloped into the police estate.

A new police station has opened in north Kent at a cost of Â£30m.  The new building at Thamesway, near Northfleet, means Dartford and Gravesend stations will be closed.  It features a 40-cell custody suite, a vulnerable witness interview room, and a garage where cars can be tested by forensic scientists.  The station, built using the private finance initiative, is heated by a geothermal system which reuses rainwater.  Mark Gilmartin, of Kent Police Authority, said: "The old police stations were no longer fit for purpose and now we have an environmentally friendly station with fantastic equipment."
