The 2009 Eisteddfod was notable because the chair was not awarded to any of the entrants as the standard was deemed to be too low.

The chair was made from wood from the site of the 2009 eisteddfod One of the top prizes at the National Eisteddfod has not been awarded after adjudicators said none of the entries was good enough. The chairing is one of the highlights of the annual festival of Welsh culture. But the three adjudicators said the seven entries lacked vision, thought, order and clarity. This is the first time since the Bridgend Eisteddfod in 1998 that the chair has not been awarded. The eisteddfod chair is offered for a poem or a series of poems in full cynghanedd (strict metre) not exceeding 200 lines. The title of this year's competition was 'Cyffro' (Disturbance). Crowned bard Ceri Wyn Jones was one of the adjudicators for the chair The judges, Branwen Jarvis, Gwenallt Llwyd Ifan and Ceri Wyn Jones, said the subject offered plenty of scope but the number poems submitted were "disappointing" and that no-one was worthy of this year's chair. The chair was designed and created by Dilwyn Jones of Celfi Derw in Maerdy and he used wood from the Rhiwlas site at Bala where this 2009 eisteddfod is being held. Earlier in the week, the other main literary prize at the eisteddfod, the crown, was won by Ceri Wyn Jones from Cardigan. Mr Jones, who was one of the three chair adjudicators, won the crown for composing series of poems with the title 'In The Blood'. A familiar face in poetic circles, he won the chair the last time the Eisteddfod was in Bala in 1997. He is also a former children's poet in Wales and his collection of poems was on the shortlist for the Welsh language Book of the Year last year.
