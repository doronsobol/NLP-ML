Actor Jeremy Edwards has become the latest celebrity to be voted off ITV's Dancing on Ice.  Both Edwards, 37, and Ellery Hanley, 47, polled the least number of public votes, and were then involved in a skate-off to remain in the competition.  The five judges then unanimously chose to save former rugby player Hanley.  Last week, former EastEnders actress Gemma Bissix became the second contestant to be voted off the ice-skating reality show.  "I have loved every second and despite what the judges thought my first skate tonight was the best I've ever had," said Edwards.  "I fully intend to keep up my skating though."  His departure leaves nine celebrities still in the show: presenters Zoe Salmon and Michael Underwood, singer Coleen Nolan, model Melinda Messenger, actors Roxanne Pallett, Todd Carty and Ray Quinn, journalist Donal MacIntyre, Jessica Taylor and Hanley.
