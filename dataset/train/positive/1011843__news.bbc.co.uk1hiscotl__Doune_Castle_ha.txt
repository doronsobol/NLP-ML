Doune Castle has become a place of pilgrimage for fans of Monty Python and the film, and, since 2004, an annual "Monty Python Day" has been held at the castle.

Organisers were bowled over when 1,400 people attended the first Monty Python day at Doune Castle last year.  This year's sell-out event has been restricted to 500 people, who will each receive their own shrubbery in memory of one of the film's running gags.  The events will include a Python Idle contest, named after group member Eric.  There will also be sketch recreations and about 1,200 coconut shells have been flown in from Florida so fans can clip-clop along during a screening of the film.  The first event was held at Doune Castle, near Stirling, to mark the 30th anniversary of the movie.  The 14th Century building appeared several times in the film, being used as Camelot, the Castle of Guy de Lombard, the Swamp Castle and Castle Anthrax.  It was privately owned at the time of filming, but is now under the stewardship of Historic Scotland.  Event manager Nick Finnigan said last year's event had received a "fantastic" response.  "We really did have everybody from five to 85 coming along, it was astonishing," he said.  "In the children's cases, it has been a fantastic effect that their parents have had on them."  The impersonation competition had to be split into different age groups because of the number of entrants last year.  "There were children of 10 and 12 years old who were able to repeat 10 to 15 minute sketches verbatim, so clearly it has an ongoing effect way beyond what you could describe as being a cult," he said.  The Holy Grail provided the inspiration for the musical Spamalot, which has been a major success on Broadway.
