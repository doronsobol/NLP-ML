The 22-year-old became the youngest ever winner in Formula One, surpassing American Troy Ruttman, who won in the United States in 1952.  Not only did Alonso become the first Spaniard to win a grand prix, but he also delivered Renault's first victory since Alain Prost won in Australia 20 years ago.  He also became the eighth different winner this season, storming to his maiden victory in his 29th Grand Prix.  "It is too many things at one time," Alonso said. "The whole weekend was fantastic. First I got pole pole position and now the victory.  Alonso took full advantage of his pole position, establishing a huge lead in the early laps and only losing it once, briefly to Kimi Raikkonen, after the first round of pit stops.  "For the first two or three laps I had Mark Webber in the mirror but after eight laps I asked my team where the others were," Alonso recalled.  "They told me they were 15 seconds back and I thought, 'My God, I am very fast now!'  "I pushed quite a lot in the first 15 laps to give myself a big advantage, and after that I took it more slowly.  Raikonnen, who finished second, did his world championship chances a power of good by reducing the gap on defending champion Michael Schumacher to two points.  Between them - only one point behind with three Grands Prix left - is Williams' Juan Pablo Montoya, who finished third.  "I am quite happy with second place after starting from seventh," Raikkonen said.  "It is better now for the championship and hopefully we can improve the car for the next race."
