Lynch, 60, has gained a reputation for complex films, including Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart and cult TV series Twin Peaks.  He was also at the festival to premiere his latest film, Inland Empire, which includes hallucinatory scenes and a talking rabbit voiced by Naomi Watts.  "Every film is like going into a new world, going into the unknown. But you should be not afraid of using your intuition, and feel and think your way through," he added.  The director did not present his actors with a full script, instead handing them a few pages of dialogue each morning as they turned up to shoot their scenes.  "It's important to be able to experiment," he said.  Star Laura Dern admitted even she was not sure what the film was about.  "The truth is I didn't know who I was playing - and I still don't know.  "I'm looking forward to seeing the film tonight to learn more," she said.
