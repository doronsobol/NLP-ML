This has been welcomed by various Chinese activists, but was regarded by some as a measure to maintain social stability and not believed to herald a changing of the Party's official position.

Tang Deying was given 70,000 yuan ($8,745) in "hardship assistance" by officials in the south-west city of Chengdu, local activist Huang Qi said.  Zhou Guocong,15, died in police custody in Chengdu days after the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests.  But other relatives say they doubt this marks a start to compensation payouts.  The Chinese authorities have consistently claimed their actions in June 1989 were justified.  Huang Qi hailed the payout as a "breakthrough", saying Tang Deying had campaigned for justice for the last 17 years.  "It's the first time that compensation has been paid for a victim of the 1989 events," he told the AFP news agency.  The award was welcomed by Beijing activist Ding Zilin whose son was killed during the protests, but she said it was unlikely to indicate a softening in the government's stance.  "This is a first, but I must point out that hardship assistance does not amount to compensation," she told the Associated Press news agency.  "Compensation would signify that the government admitted it had wrongly killed someone, but I don't see such an admission in this case".  Hundreds of demonstrators were killed when the authorities sent in tanks to Tiananmen Square on 3-4 June 1989 to break up the mass protests calling for greater freedoms.  In the days that followed, police carried out a nationwide crackdown of protesters and bystanders caught up in similar movements in other cities around the country.  Mr Zhou is thought to have been beaten to death while in police custody. Although he was cremated, photos of his body showing the cuts and bruises later emerged.
