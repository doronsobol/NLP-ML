Leicester City have confirmed club captain Matt Elliott is to retire from the game. Elliott has been plagued by a knee injury for the past two seasons and has only played three times this season. Elliott, who guided the club to two League Cup wins in 1997 and 2000, played nearly 300 games for the club and was bought for £1.6 million from Oxford by Martin O'Neill in January 1997. In all, Elliott made 719 career appearances in all competitions and scored 85 times. He played 18 times for Scotland and scored one goal. "I can take away so many wonderful memories of my time here and the club will always hold a special place in my heart." He was loaned out to Ipswich at the end of last season - playing 10 times - but has now called it a day. Elliott says he is still unsure about his future plans and is keeping his options open. “Football has been my life for so many years so it will be strange to be without it,” he added. I plan to take a bit of time off and then undertake my coaching badges. “I will miss Leicester City but I can take away so many wonderful memories of my time here and the club will always hold a special place in my heart," adds Elliott. Craig Levein adds: "Although I have only been here a short time, I know just how much he has done for this football club and, on behalf of everyone connected with Leicester City, I thank him for his outstanding service."
