A Wirral wildlife haven will be without a live-in custodian as Wirral Council say they have had difficulty finding a ranger prepared to live without mains electricity or running water on Hilbre Island.  Councillor David Elderton, Wirral Council cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism, said "We are finding it very difficult finding someone who will live there, cut off from the mainland half the time."  Hilbre Island, off the coast of west Wirral near to West Kirkby is part of the Dee Estuary and home to seals, oystercatchers. The island is a Grade I Site of Special Scientific Interest.  While there will no longer be a permanent human presence on the island Joe Hanik from the Wirral Ranger Service says there will still be regular visits by rangers, "We've got a team of rangers that can come out here.  "Not necessarily just to respond but to come out here more regularly."
