It has made international headlines due to its use of modern clothing and local people as the apostles.

The painting, at St Paul's in Tintagel, depicts local people dressed in contemporary style in place of Christ and his disciples.  The modern interpretation was commissioned to mark the 40th anniversary of the building.  Artist Nicholas St John Rosse used his son Alex as a model for Christ.  Local people were also used to portray Christ's disciples, including parish priest Father Brian Storey as the apostle Andrew.  Da Vinci's 15th Century Renaissance work was commissioned by the Duke of Milan and took three years to paint.  It now hangs in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy.  Mr St John Rosse, who took about 18 months to complete his painting said: "I have always been interested in da Vinci.  "The Last Supper was painted in his time so this seemed the natural thing to do. "  The painting, which is 10ft by 3ft (3m by 1m), will be on display on an easel until it is hung above the church sanctuary later this month.  "Father Storey has seen it and approved of it, but I'm not sure that the congregation know that it is in contemporary dress," Mr St John Rosse said.  "I have dressed them in things such as collarless shirts, but anyone looking at the picture will realise that the characters are real people and not imaginative representations.  "The congregation has given me a huge amount of freedom with this picture and really left me to my own devices.  "Now, I hope they will like it."
