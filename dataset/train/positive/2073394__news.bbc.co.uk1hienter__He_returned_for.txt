But the show - which has suffered poor ratings throughout its run - was beaten by BBC One drama Murphy's Law, which won an average audience of 5.5m people.  Best - son of late footballer George - and Paul Gascoigne's step-daughter, beat three other finalists.  Gascoigne said she and Best won the final vote "as mates".  Ex-Eternal singer Kelle Bryan, Strictly Come Dancing star Brendan Cole and former Big Brother winner Kate Lawler lost out in the final live vote.  The show's audience peaked at 4.2m viewers, but was still beaten by the BBC's Ten O'Clock News, which was watched by 5.6m, according to overnight figures.  The programme has frequently failed to top 2m during its run, and suffered being scheduled against Channel 4's Big Brother.  Best made a return to the show after appearing in the first series, while former Hollyoaks actor Paul Danan also made a comeback.  Lee Otway - who also appeared in Hollyoaks - was injured in a fight with New Zealander Cole.  Some of the programme's contestants, including ex-Boyzone singer Shane Lynch and Jackass star Steve-O, made early departures from the programme's Fijian base.
