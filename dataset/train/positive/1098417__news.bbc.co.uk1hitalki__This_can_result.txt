This can result in injury or death to the horse, as well as the jockey.

Animal rights activists are urging a boycott of the Grand National after five horses died on the famous Aintree racecourse this week. The RSPCA insist the course was in top condition and officials described the deaths as "freak occurrences" and a "statistical blip". But animal rights campaigners will be picketing betting shops to highlight what they see as an event that promotes "suffering and death". Will you be placing a bet on this Saturday's race? Do you think accidents like this are an accepted consequence of the sport, or do you think it's unnecessary to subject the horses to what some consider to be a dangerous course? No, I will never bet on a horse-race or any event where animals are being put at risk for the pure "pleasure of sport" of some group of people who think it is a "noble" sport. Not to mention the course itself; injury, even death, cannot be prevented and therefore this "sport" is no less barbaric then fox-hunting...another sport of this great species we call "Homo sapiens" or "wise man". Not really...    Wouter Verheul, Netherlands    I think it is unfair to suggest that people who are committed to animal rights do not care about human beings who are suffering.    Firstly, I think it is unfair to suggest that people who are committed to animal rights do not care about human beings who are suffering. Most people have room in their heads to feel compassion for more than one species. Personally, I believe that these events should be modified to minimise the risk to horses, rather than banned. Secondly, I believe that those who condemn ALL jockeys and suggest that they do not care for their horses are also being grossly unfair. I once taught I.T. skills to jockeys, who were nearing the end of their careers and, believe me, they were very committed to the safety and well being of the horses in their care.    Bella, UK Everyone should look at "Grif-Canada" comments as most people seem to be miss informed. The Grand National claimed no horse fatalities this year. Furthermore a certain horse which unseated it's rider at the fourteenth fence (before the stable entrance) decided to finish the race itself - riderless and jumped every fence thereafter. This to me doesn't seem like an animal that is not enjoying himself. A horse does not do what it is told and if it doesn't want to jump a fence it will not do so. Perhaps people should become more informed on this subject before commenting about it.    Dick Casey, Hong Kong What if five jockeys had died? What of all the calls to ban boxing? At least the boxers can make their own choice. It is time such primitive barbaric behaviour was outlawed. This is the 21st. Century after all. I am perturbed that the British RSPCA makes excuses for these alleged human beings. Penalties for all forms of animal cruelty are far too lenient and must be increased.    D.A.Mbange, Australia    When a parent takes a child for a ride in the car, that child's life is at risk. Are we to believe that the parent holds no love for the child?    I strongly disagree with those who say that jockeys wouldn't risk the lives of the horses if they loved them. When a parent takes a child for a ride in the car, that child's life is at risk. Are we to believe that the parent holds no love for the child? I am personally not interested in horse racing, yet I am appalled by the number comments posted here that are based on little more than vague emotion with no bearing on the event, people who obviously know even less than I do! I bet they shrug off news that 350 people died in an earthquake but are horrified when a dog has been killed in a road accident.    Daniel, England Where were all the protesters before the Aintree meetings? As always it is clueless people latching onto whatever is shown to them on the news. Do any of these people ever have their own opinions before being spoon fed by the media?    Steven, UK Are we all going soft - its all pathetic, we will soon be stopped from walking because it causes unnecessary harm to insects.    Dawson, UK Let's take a look at Boxing; A few individuals lose their lives or are seriously injured over the course of many decades and there's so much uproar that the rules are changed to the point where we now rarely see an actual 'Knock-down' as the fight is usually stopped in the name of 'Safety' before it reaches that point. Hundreds of horses have died for other peoples entertainment over the past few decades and to this day continue to do so... They haven't yet lowered the fences one-inch. The poor things don't even have the choice of whether or not they want to compete.    Wayne Brannan, UK I feel that the Steeplechase should definitely be banned. What gives human beings the right to gamble with horses knowing that it endangers their lives? It is incredibly cruel to still have the Steeplechase even after so many horses have died as a result of human entertainment. No one should play with life- even if it is that of an animal.    Deborah Robert, South Africa    Steeplechasing is not cruel, its glorious.    Steeplechasing is not cruel, its glorious. Nobody (bar some dimwit owners) goes into racing with the sole intent of making money, without regard for the horse. Its the poor activists who cannot see that the thrilling uncertainty of the chase is wonderful thing. And don't tell me nobody asked the horse - have you every tried to move a couple of hundred pounds of recalcitrant flesh that wasn't having it?    Craig Harry, England I can't believe the ignorance in this column. People can choose whether to box, play rugby etc. The horses do not have a choice. Why is it assumed that we have the right to force other creatures to entertain us when this often results in needless suffering for these other creatures. Do people have automatic rights over animals simply because we are more intelligent? Extending this argument should intelligent people automatically have rights over less intelligent people? The whole distinction between people and "dumb" animals is ridiculous.    Sean Taylor, US (Brit ex-pat) In response to Steve Porter of Northern Ireland. Animal activists are not in the business of making martyrs or heroes from dead horses, their aim is to keep them alive and happy hence the objection to the Grand National!!!    Yasmin, England What would have happened if it had been 5 Jockeys that had died?    Sarah, England    You can't tell a half ton of horse to rest whilst it's broken leg mends and trying to treat any serious injury can in itself lead to death through inactivity.    I am a qualified vet with additional interests and training in animal psychology. What these anthropomorphic's seem to forget is that there are far more cruel things you can do to any animal than put it to sleep. You can't tell a half ton of horse to rest whilst it's broken leg mends and trying to treat any serious injury can in itself lead to death through inactivity - horses' digestive and respiratory systems were not designed to cope with slings or forced 'bed rest'. Thousands of animals are put to sleep each year because it is the best thing for them, to 'put them out of their misery'. Horses break legs through accidents - it's no one's intention that they do so and, having served on racecourses, I can tell you that it is an incredibly sad thing for everyone except the horse.    Tessa Jones, England I have worked with horses for many years in many different aspects but NOT racing! I personally believe that it is a cruel sport - some argue that the horses are bred for it but surely not for the size of the Aintree fences? The world of racing, flat or jumping, is a hard one for the horse - they are no longer an animal but a commodity that can be abused and when necessary replaced with a hefty insurance payout. They are involved in the changing hands of vast sums of money for gambling, breeding and plain prestige this obviously leads to cruelty due to the high stakes and this most magnificent of animals becomes just a lump of MEAT. Please, if nothing else, ban The 'Grand' National    Hilary, UK Has anyone asked the horses! Seriously, steeple chasing is dangerous and should be banned or at least the jumps reduced to save horses' lives. Would we ask humans to give their lives jumping over fences?    Nick Bishop, England The use of animals in such a manner is barbaric and blatantly inhumane.    Scott Campbell, USA Banning steeplechases is all very well, but what do you think would happen to all the horses suddenly left without anything to do? Do you think the owners would keep them on through the goodness of their hearts? Do you think the trainers (now suddenly out of work) could afford to? Hardly. What you would end up with would be one of the largest gluts of horsemeat that the meat market has ever known. I'm not convinced that this is an improvement on one or two horses dying in a year.    Sarah Blake, UK    It is a barbaric sport, "enjoyed" by people who are only in it for their own financial gain.    It should definitely be banned. It is a barbaric sport, "enjoyed" by people who are only in it for their own financial gain. Most racehorses (if they survive the racing) end up as dog food, only a small percentage enjoy a relaxing retirement. It is just another typical example of people's greed, another "Good old British tradition", simply disgusting!    Mariska van Geelen, UK (Dutch) Before all, it isn't just sport, but unique social event and business. Behind this business are powerful persons with their passion for entertainment and money...    Peter Kaukov, Canada 5 horses died before the Grand National this week. That is disgusting. Any 'sport' which results in animals dying for human pleasure should be banned. This includes hunting AND the steeplechase.    Benj'min Mossop, Britain All animal races are not sports, they should not be glorified with the term sport.    Leigh, England    Horses enjoy running and physical exercise, but steeplechasing is an unnatural activity.    Do horses enjoy racing much? I'm not convinced that they all do as much as claimed. Where is the evidence? It won't do to say "if you have worked with horses, it's obvious". I HAVE worked with horses and studied their behaviour closely over many years - I don't think it is so obvious. It seems to me they are doing what they are bred and trained to do. Given the choice, I think they would prefer to spend their time munching grass with other horses. They do enjoy running and physical exercise, but steeplechasing is a rather unnatural activity, don't you think?  Francis Burton, Scotland Horses die from accident and injury in any equestrian sport. Flat racers have had a heart attack and some have broken legs stumbling. The national is a hard race and accidents will happen. They are always sad but that is no reason to ban it.  Kelv, England Outrageous that 5 horses have to die in the name of steeplechasing. Out of 40 horses that started yesterday, only 17 made it to the finish line. It seems that Britain is like Rome in the old days, the more casualties, the more exiting it is. What would have happened if 5 jockeys had died?  Susan van Lennep, USA One more time, human beings have proven ourselves to be heartless and outrageously selfish. It is unconscionable that this race continues and should be banned immediately along with regular horse racing!    Enid Breakstone, US How many activists can remember the horses who died in the race? I, like most fans of the National remember all their names. They are heroes in my eyes. Horses like Alverton, Eudipe, Dark Ivy & Beau Bob. To activists they are merely dumb animals. The race fan who remembers those who have been lost or the activist who is simply looking for another way to rebel against authority?  Steve Porter, Northern Ireland Britain has so many great sports that do not involve animals eg football, athletics, etc. Horse racing is purely for gambling purposes and is not even a real sport. Let's make the 21st century the age of compassion.  Richard Rosson, UK It's hard when you care about animals, to see them injured or killed, and I do think the National could be modified to make the jumps less hazardous while still maintaining its status as the world's premier steeplechase. Why shouldn't people care equally for humans and animals?  Susie, Scotland Some of the arguments on this site are so misguided, that they are worthless. Four horses lost their lives on Thursday, one in a race that uses one circuit of the 'National' fences, one over normal Steeplechase fences, one over hurdles (small fences) and one of a heart attack after completing the race and walking back to unsaddle. On Friday there was another fatality, by coincidence, also the first fence in a race using one circuit of the 'National' fences. This fence is actually one of the smallest, but as it is the first, they probably approach it a little to quickly. As far as I know, there were no fatalities in the Grand National today.  Griff., Canada Make the jumps lower. It's the obvious answer.  Andrew Daniels, England Motor vehicles kill and maim untold numbers of animals and people. Why not ban them all? In my experience, if a horse does not enjoy jumping, you might make a jumper out of him, but you won't go far. Certainly not to the level of a Grand National mount.  V. Wiseman, USA/UK It's sad five horses have died in two days at Aintree. Would someone tell me how many people died over the same period in car crashes or of smoking related illness. Then let's focus this outpouring of indignation on reducing this senseless waste of human life before we ban horse racing et al. What a difference we could make if we cared as much about PEOPLE as we appear to care about animals.  Richard P, England I like to strap these so-called jockeys onto motorcross bikes with the throttle wide open and but them on a track with unexpected sheer drops and water pits. See if they enjoy it, and you can bet it will happen if you can bet on it. Freedom for horses, in the new millennium horses should not be ridden at all.  Fat Bob, Northampton, UK The Grand National has high fences because the organisers know that only the best horses will manage to get over them, even then though they can't say an accident will not happen. I look at it this way. Horses are dying because of a human pastime. Not for food or clothing, but like bull fighting, for enjoyment. That can't be right. Yes keep the flat racing, but don't let the animals die because you like a flutter.    Tony Martin, UK I think this is similar to the case of speeding drivers occasionally killing people by selfishly driving too fast... It seems the love of money and selfish entertainment are considered more important the horses own suffering and lives. This is just yet another example of our so-called 'Caring' Society!    Adrian Paul Miles, Birmingham, England, UK I don't think horse racing of any form should be banned but surely the courses could be safer for the animals involved?    Richard Phillips, UK If the media would ignore such extremism, there would be nothing to get all upset about. I guess they have never seen a jockey fly over the horse because THE HORSE decided not to jump.    Ron K, USA    I wonder how, we can justify such racing, which has the potential of life threatening injuries for both jockeys and horses.    Yes, steeple chasing should be banned. When I was growing up in West Derby, Liverpool, my parents took me to the Grand National. I can still vividly recall the sight of a horse stumbling and falling at a nearby jump. Race officials subsequently came and shot the horse. The incident happened close to where we were seated. I remember crying and burying my face in my father's chest. Both then and now, I wonder how, we can justify such racing, which has the potential of life threatening injuries for both jockeys and horses.    Pat van der Veer, Canada John from England is talking rubbish. The whole point of protecting 'dumb' animals is to demonstrate that we have evolved enough not to cause pain to others, including animals. The horses do not have the choice.    Andrew, England    I am not in favour of banning racing completely, but it should be made much safer.    I don't believe that trainers, jockeys or even owners really love their horses, no more than they would love a car. I watch the jockeys riding in races and it is apparent to me, that the determination to be first past the post, overrules the feelings and consideration for the 'live animal' they are riding. The Grand National has always been a cruel race, but I feel that now with the fences becoming bigger, the horses and jockeys who are entered are not experienced enough for this race. I am an animal lover and in particular a horse lover, having owned one in the past. I am not in favour of banning racing completely, but it should be made much safer.    Irene Walsh, England Why? If steeplechases were banned then there would be a lot less horses in this country - fact. If animals are of no use to mankind they rapidly go extinct - fact (though unpleasant). Horses enjoy racing - fact. Animal rights activists need to think what will happen as a result of their demands - Fat chance of that though.    Richard Mottershead, UK Yesterday's deaths, dismissed as 'unfortunate accidents' by those horse-racing fanatics who care not one iota for horses but for the money involved, were sickening. What is worse is that they reveal the depth to which the British are utter hypocrites when it comes to animal 'rights'. We deplore other countries' obvious abuses of animals for public entertainment, yet we continue to subject our horses, that most elegant of creatures, to a merciless frenzy which results in them breaking their backs, necks and legs. The whole thing is grotesque.    Steven Eke, England    Where will this banning things stop?    The horses, which race at this level, are loved and looked after like few other animals we keep. They love the racing as much as the jockeys and spectators - you know that if you've ridden in a race - and those that do not love racing don't get to a top. Where will this banning things stop?    Peter, UK The self-righteous zealots of the Western world have found a new refuge in animal rights and similar "causes". It makes them feel important. Eat some steak, have a bet, and ignore them.    S. Thomas, Australia If you are going to ban fox hunting, you have to ban all sports that involve animals. The animals do not know it's a sport, they are following an instinct to chase or to flee. You have to look at where we want to go with banning animal sports as a country and as the globe in general. I noticed in the news that the Tiger is close to being wiped out again. How many species do WE have to destroy to learn!    Steven Robinson, England To ban the steeple chase would be as stupid as banning boxing, but I do feel that if what I heard about the national (that ditches have been deepened and fences raised) is true, I think that this too is idiocy. The idea should be to have as little risk to the horses as possible. Doing this only endangers the horses even further.    Trevor Blayney, N. Ireland If steeplechases are banned in horse racing what implications will this have for the human version of the sport. Should the Olympic Steeplechase event be stopped also?    Darryl Barber, UK What is most horrifying, regardless of the alleged safety of steeplechases, is the despicable way in which the lives of horses are terminated and discarded in the most off-hand manner when the animal is unfortunate enough to have an accident. As has been said on this forum: "one favourite for the National was put down following a training accident last week". Perhaps if I were to break my wrist and be unable to sit at this computer and do my job, I too should be terminated without delay, as though the further maintenance of my life were a burden that no longer deserved to be met?    Michael Kilpatrick, UK Whilst the death of the horses during the recent races is a tragedy, it has always happened, and will happen again. Complete banning of the sport just isn't a viable idea. What is viable however, is the introduction of much more 'horse friendly' jumps. This would help to ensure less fatalities whilst not detracting an enormous amount from the quality of the overall racing spectacle.    Jon Evans, England    It sickens me that the weirdoes in the animal rights lobby grab the headlines because four dumb animals have died.    In a week when two human beings have been murdered in Turkey it sickens me that the weirdoes in the animal rights lobby grab the headlines because four dumb animals have died. It's time they realised that rights are counter balanced by responsibilities. As animals cannot accept responsibility for they have no rights.    John, England I think the Grand National should be changed. If you look at how many horses actually complete the race each year, it's about 30%. (Usually 40 or so runners, of which 10 - 15 complete it). It would be better to lower the height of some of the really tough jumps so that more horses complete the race. More importantly, there'd be less casualties, too. The sheer distance is a good enough challenge.    Mark, UK. The key to all this is in the word Race horse. Horses like this were bred, raised and trained to race. Without racing there would be no racehorse, which I am sure the animal rights lobby would find equally disagreeable.   Every person on the race track or in any way interested in racing would have been upset yesterday will have been upset by the four deaths. However while every precaution and safety measure was in place to minimise the risks, there will always be an element of danger.   Sports such as Rugby, boxing, skiing, motor sports are surely a more fitting target to ban on safety grounds.    Sean, UK The real dangers lie in Steeplechases - hurdling and flat racing are relatively safe for horse and rider. The National is yet another Festival of Greed - which the UK is becoming very good at. Sport it is not!    Alasdair C, Scotland Jockeys have a choice. Horses don't. End of argument.    TJ, Ye Old Merry England Watch the race on Saturday and see how many riderless horses continue to run and jump even without a jockey. Then tell me, with a straight face, that the Grand National is cruel and unnatural for horses.    Richard P, England    The death of one horse at such a public event is bad enough, but to lose four is appalling.    I was extremely upset to hear of yesterday's deaths. I appreciate that the Grand National is an extremely well loved event and that many people who have no real interest in horse racing enjoying watching the National. However, the death of one horse at such a public event is bad enough, but to lose four is appalling.   I like many others do not want to see the race banned but do feel strongly that the course should be altered, either by redesigning the jumps and shortening the length of the course.    Claire, UK There is nothing "grand" about a race that each year claims innocent equine lives. The whole racing industry is based on money and not the love of horses.    Vikki Martin, Essex, England    Horses do not run or jump if they do not want to - it's a simple as that.    Having worked with horses for several years and seen several occasions where they have suffered fatal injuries simply galloping around their own exercise paddock, I am frequently irritated by the obsessive ramblings of a group of people (animal rights activists) who insist on interfering with issues about which they know absolutely nothing. Horses do not run or jump if they do not want to - it's a simple as that.   We get to this situation every year during Grand National week, purely because it is one of the most famous and publicised races in the world - I would prefer to see these animal rights activists spending more time lobbying for stiffer penalties for those people who abuse, neglect and appallingly mistreat animals rather than pointing their fingers at those who love and respect the noble qualities of the Thoroughbred.    Heather Nash, UK It is now an unfortunate occurrence in today's society that we value life bellow that of sport. With the tragic deaths in mid-week of the two Leeds supporters and now the Grand National claims another four horses.    David Ashcroft, UK    I don't believe animals should be made to suffer and die for our entertainment.    Far too many horses are killed in horse racing, especially in steeplechasing. Sadly it is not just those that are killed dramatically on the course that die. Many more suffer less obvious injuries which result in them being destroyed later as they are not fit to race anymore.   I would never bet on any race as I don't believe animals should be made to suffer and die for our entertainment.    Lynne Mitchell, Scotland I go to Goodwood once a year - as often as I get to hear about a fatality in the world of horse racing. Surely four horses being killed on one day IS exceptional, not the norm and shouldn't be blown up out of proportion. It is a tough course, but should we really be making such a fuss.   If large numbers of horses and/or jockeys were being injured every week then maybe a rethink of the course design would be necessary. Oh and yes I do have a bet on for the race tomorrow - a sweepstake at work - the name of the horse is unpronounceable so I won't be doing much "come on..."    Nicola Jardes, UK Every year it's the same...4...5...6...7...8 horses seem to die during Aintree week. It would be daft to ban steeplechasing though because the horses seem to enjoy it (they wouldn't run if they didn't), but maybe we'll have to think about decreasing the jumps or the size of the field.   I can think of nothing more upsetting to a family day out at the races than children having to witness the bodies of dead horses.    Jill Baird, Scotland    It is just a sport and entertainment that is healthy for the horses and is good fun and enjoyment for the jockeys.    I think steeplechase should not be banned because it is just a sport and entertainment that is healthy for the horses and is good fun and enjoyment for the jockeys the accidents that happen are just unfortunate and like many sports it is not always safe to take part.But I still don't think it should be banned because it could ruin the history of horse racing.    Emily McCarthy, England I was stationed in the UK in the early fifties when Princess Margaret had an entry, considered by many to be a favourite in the Grand National, a mare named Monoveen, as I remember. She went down in the race and had to be put down.   I have long criticised this race. Racing fans have told me of at least one race in which they all went down and the race was won by a remounted jockey. This is cruelty to an animal species which has aided mankind's development immeasurably before the era of motorization. They should not be mistreated nor eaten.    Steve Block, USA It took some time, but F1 drivers fought, and as a result, the tracks are much safer and it is now rare to hear that a driver has died in a crash. Unfortunately, horses can't tell us how they feel about the courses. Although I suspect that the prospect of running some of theses courses does not thrill them. All things evolve and maybe its time to examine theses courses and change some aspects so that they are humane to all participants. All things in moderation.    V. Cancara, Canada I am not a great follower of horse racing, but I do like to watch the really big events. I rate the grand national as an awesome spectacle and find that it would be a shame to lose so much tradition over freak accidents. I would appreciate it if the protesters would rather find something else to do with their time, maybe work would be good idea!!    Tomas Bezuidenhout, South Africa    It would be a shame to lose so much tradition over freak accidents.    You may not have noticed that one of the horses who died yesterday fell in a hurdle race, not a steeplechase. Hurdling is faster, the jumping flatter and more damage can be done to horse and rider in a fall. The most dangerous fall is one on the flat because of the relative speed. One of the favourites for the National was put down following a training accident last week. If you want to ban steeplechases, you would have to look at banning all horse racing and rid the country of one of its most popular, famous and prestigious sports. Two football fans were stabbed to death - does anyone talk of banning football?    Jenni, UK Most of the people involved in the industry are devoted to the welfare of the horses. I grew up in an area famous for training National winners. The feelings of compassion for the injured horses are felt strongest by those who care for the horses day-in, day-out.    Jim, UK Like most debates about the country, the negative voices will be the loudest, and one can bet that they will be shouted from the rooftops of the city. Horse racing has always had tragic losses, and the loss of a couple of great old campaigners yesterday in Lake Kariba and Strong Promise is particularly sad. However the National Hunt is continually looking for ways to make the sport safer for the horses and jockeys alike, and Aintree is a much safer course today than it has ever been. However, there are bound to be those in this Talking Point that rely on sentiment and limited understanding of the facts proclaiming the viciousness of this sport and the terrible cruelty.    Anon, UK    Two football fans were stabbed to death - does anyone talk of banning football?    I really have to disagree with animal rights activists on this point. First of all I don't want people to dismiss this argument as old school rhetoric, I'm all for the banning of foxhunting and rabbit coursing but horse racing and steeplechases are not cruel or unusual punishment but generally a form of safe and healthy exercise that benefits both horse and owner. Horses are treated with the care and respect they deserve and held in great affection by their owners.    Michael Carey, N.Ireland Jockeys, trainers and the owners all claim they have a love for the horses. Would one really risk the lives of the ones they love? I suggest the love lies in money rather than the horses.    Steve Park, England I think that races such as the Grand National are abhorrent and should be banned. Anyone who thinks this is entertainment and enjoyable need to take a long hard look at the risks these horses take in pursuit of your "entertainment". Personally, rather than run the Grand National, why don't they just walk down the start line with a loaded gun and have a game of Russian Roulette?    mel, UK    Rather than run the Grand National, why don't the jockeys just walk down the start line with a loaded gun and have a game of Russian Roulette?    I have felt for many years that steeplechases should be banned - it is obscene that animals should die for the sake of our so called 'entertainment'. We banned bear baiting and other forms of cruelty to animals for 'entertainment' many years ago - why has this been allowed to go on? Because there is so much money tied up in it would be my answer, and as we all know 'Money talks' unfortunately.    .Jean McCarthy, England Can you imagine the inquiry that would result if four athletes in an Olympic event, died in the race? Would that be accepted as a "statistical blip"? I suspect if it were four jockeys who had died, the course officials would be a little less complacent in their explanation. Whoever called this a statistical blip, clearly doesn't understand statistics.    Nige, UK
