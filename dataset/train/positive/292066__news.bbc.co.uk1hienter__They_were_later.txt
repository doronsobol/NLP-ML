Radio presenter Zoe Ball has admitted she is in a new relationship following her break-up from DJ Norman Cook.  The star said she and Cook, better known as Fatboy Slim, split up in December last year, following "problems".  She said a "friendship" with DJ Daniel Peppe "developed" after the break-up with Cook.  Peppe is a DJ and is part of underground act Themroc. He has also released tracks under the name Agent Provocateur.  Ball asked the media for "time and space" and to treat her and her family "graciously".  Ball and Cook married four years ago and their marriage was considered to be very strong.  She said: "I'm trying very hard to conduct my personal life away from the eyes of the press, but this is proving impossible.  "There were problems in our marriage that had arisen and I had subsequently met someone else - I told Norman in December that this was the case - he didn't want to know the name or any other detail."  The radio presenter confirmed she was taking a two-week break from her Xfm radio show.  "Being there for my son Woody is vital," she said.
