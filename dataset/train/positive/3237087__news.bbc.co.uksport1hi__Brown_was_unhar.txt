The former Scotland international was hurt making a tackle during Saturday's 5-0 hammering at Celtic.  X-rays have identified broken tibia and fibula bones and McCann will undergo an operation on Sunday.  "This is clearly very bad news for Neil and we feel for him," assistant coach Stephen Frail told the club website. "We wish him a speedy recovery."  The 33-year-old arrived for his second spell at Tynecastle in January 2006 but suffered medial knee ligament injury during his first game back and did not play again that season.  He played in 28 games last term but now faces another lengthy lay-off after making his first appearance of this season.  McCann, capped 26 times, left the Edinburgh club in December 1998, when he joined Rangers for £2m.  He then moved to Southampton for £1.5m in August 2003 but injuries and a loss of form limited his impact in England.
