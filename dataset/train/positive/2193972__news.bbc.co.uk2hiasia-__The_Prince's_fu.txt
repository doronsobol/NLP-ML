The funeral has taken place of Japan's Prince Takamado who died last week at the age of 47.  Around 900 mourners attended the ritual Shinto ceremony at the Toshimagaoka cemetery in northern Tokyo.  They included the Prince's widow, Princess Hisako, and the couple's three daughters, Princesses Tsuguko, Noriko and Ayako.  Senior members of the Japanese Royal Family, the country's leading politicians and foreign dignitaries were also present at the service which was broadcast live on national television.  In accordance with tradition, the Prince's cousin, Emperor Akihito, did not attend the ceremony. Instead, he sent symbolic gifts which were laid at the funeral altar.  The prince, who was seventh in line to the throne, died of heart failure after collapsing while playing squash at the Canadian embassy in Tokyo.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
