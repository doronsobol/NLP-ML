Tameside Council has granted planning permission for the store, which is expected to open in Ashton-under-Lyne in October, creating about 500 jobs.  Councillor Kieran Quinn, from Tameside Council, said it was likely to attract other businesses to the area.  Ikea failed twice to get permission to build a store in Stockport.  The company had appealed to the high court after Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott twice blocked the development, but the appeal was rejected in February last year.  The Ashton-under-Lyne store is planned to be built on the corner of Wellington Road and Oldham Road.  Mr Quinn,Tameside Council's executive member for jobs and new investment, said: "It's brilliant news for Greater Manchester.  "Not only are we bringing an iconic company into the area, we are also bringing with it 500 new jobs.  "People look to towns where Ikea is and we believe that other new businesses will now look to Tameside."  Scott Cordrey, Ikea's UK property manager, said: "We're happy to have obtained such a good site in Ashton and glad that the plans have been approved.  "It's fantastic news for Ikea and all our customers in Greater Manchester."
