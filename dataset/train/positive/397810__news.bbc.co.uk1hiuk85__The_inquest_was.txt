Fashion designer Alexander McQueen hanged himself in a wardrobe after leaving a note, an inquest in London has been told.  He was found dead at his London home on Thursday, as final preparations were being made for his spring collection to be unveiled in Paris.  Westminster Coroner's Court was told a post-mortem examination had said he had died due to asphyxiation and hanging.  Mr McQueen died on the eve of the funeral of his mother, Joyce.  The five-minute hearing was told his body had been identified on the day of his death by his sister, Janet McQueen, of Hornchurch, Essex.  Det Insp Paul Armstrong told the inquest there were no suspicious circumstances.  He presented the note found at the scene to the coroner, Dr Paul Knapman, for further investigation.  Coroner's officer Lynda Martindill said no report of the post-mortem examination was yet available.  Dr Knapman adjourned the inquest until 1000 GMT on 28 April.  Reporters were passed a note asking them to respect the McQueen family's privacy.  Mr McQueen was named British designer of the year four times after 1996.  His close friend fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who helped launch his career, killed herself in 2007.  Performing at the Brit awards on Tuesday night, Mr McQueen's friend Lady Gaga dedicated a song to him.
