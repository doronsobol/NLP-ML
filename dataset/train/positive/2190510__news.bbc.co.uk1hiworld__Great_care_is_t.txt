The books were flown on board a chartered airliner which took off from the Punjabi city of Amritsar.  Hundreds of Sikhs came out of their homes to cheer an unusual procession.  Devotees carried silk-covered copies of the book on their heads over a four-kilometre distance (2.5 miles), to Amritsar international airport.  State Chief Minister Amarinder Singh was among those who considered themselves fortunate for the chance to help carry the holy books into the aircraft.  Each copy of the Guru Granth Sahib was reverentially placed on a separate seat.  Religious officials said that on arrival in Toronto the flight would be personally met by Prime Minister Paul Martin and leaders of Canada's Sikh community.  The Sikh religious body based in Amritsar says it is the sole worldwide publisher of the Guru Granth Sahib, since the printing needs to conform to the Sikh code of conduct, or maryada.  This is because Sikhs revere their holy book as a living Guru.  In view of the huge demand for copies of the holy book in Western nations, the committee is now actively considering proposals to establish a suitable printing facility in Canada.  This facility, to be paid for by the Canadian Sikh community, will need to be identical to that operated in Amritsar.  But until that is done, officials say, copies of the Guru Granth Sahib will have to be transported from India.
