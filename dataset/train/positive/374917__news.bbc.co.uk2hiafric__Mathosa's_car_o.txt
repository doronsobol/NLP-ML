Mathosa, 29, died when the driver of her car seemed to lose control on a motorway near Johannesburg.  She was one of the stars of Kwaito, a South African fusion of hip-hop, funk and traditional rhythms, and also appeared on local television dramas.  She was known for her dyed blonde hair and energetic shows, and her album Drama Queen topped the charts in 2004.  She was nominated for the UK's Music of Black Origin (Mobo) awards earlier this year.  Last year, she performed in front of huge crowds at Nelson Mandela's 85th birthday party.  Her death comes almost two years after the death of South African diva Brenda Fassie.  At the time, Mathosa told the Mail & Guardian newspaper: "You can't deny death, you can't fear it. I'm sure God has a better place for us, if you're a believer."  She first stared in the 1990s with the group Boom Shaka, before launching her solo career.  Leslie Sedibe from Mathosa's record label EMI said staff were "devastated".  "I don't think that there is any artist after Brenda Fassie, who could match her talent and energy on stage," she said.
