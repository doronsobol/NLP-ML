Campaigners including doctors, nurses, business people, journalists and councillors marched through the streets and held up the traffic, then later called for the resignations of the PCT board members after they turned down a £100,000 donation offered by East Lindsey District Council to enable the ward to remain open through the winter.

The Scarborough Ward was shut at the start of the month to help East Lincolnshire Primary Care Trust reduce a £7m overspend.  Health managers have promised patient care will not suffer and the ward will re-open in April.  Eileen Verhoven, who joined the march on Saturday, said the campaign to reopen the ward is gathering momentum.  The East Lincolnshire PCT said it is looking again at whether it can legally accept money from East Lindsey District Council to keep the ward open.  The authority made the offer of cash but the trust turned it down.  All 26 staff on the ward will be redeployed as community nurses while it is shut.
