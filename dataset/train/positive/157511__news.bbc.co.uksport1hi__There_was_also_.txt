Eight Manchester United players were among 23 people killed in the crash.  The Football Association were worried the silence would not be respected but a spokesman said on Monday: "We believe very strongly this will be respected.  "There's a feeling across the country that a minute's silence is the best way to remember everybody who died."  FA chief executive Brian Barwick has spoken with his United counterpart David Gill and club secretary Ken Ramsden to ensure the club are happy with the plans.  Bevington added: "The players will be wearing black armbands and there will be film on both giant screens of the Busby Babes.  "There will also be a tribute to the Busby Babes in the match programme.  "This was a tragedy for Manchester United in 1958 but we should also recognise there were England players who were lost while representing English football in European competition."  The game at Wembley against Switzerland will be new coach Fabio Capello's first game in charge of the England team.  Manchester United will mark the anniversary during their match with Manchester City on 10 February where there will be a minute's silence.  United will wear a special replica of their 1958 kit on the day, devoid of the players' names or shirt numbers on the back, while City's kit will incorporate a black ribbon with their sponsor's branding removed.
