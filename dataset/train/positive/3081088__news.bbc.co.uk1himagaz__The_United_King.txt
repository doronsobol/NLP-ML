The United Kingdom outlawed live-animal prizes such as goldfish in 2004.

The brightly coloured creatures, traditionally given as prizes in plastic bags, will no longer meet whatever watery fate their unsuspecting "owner" might choose for them.  Their future is to be sealed by proposed laws forbidding the giving of animals as prizes.  As well as worries about the standard of their care while waiting for their new home and, indeed, once they found it, the government believes winning an animal as a prize is "not thought to be consistent with a responsible approach to becoming an owner".  As one commentator remarked: "[The new owner] may be good at darts or hoop-la, but that does not qualify them as fish-keepers."  In other words, the basic principles of goldfish-owning etiquette, such as cleaning out the bowl and making feeding arrangements for holidays, could be overlooked.  Friends will no doubt have seen an early sign of Prize Goldfish in a Bag's demise in the refusal of many local authorities to grant the necessary licences to fairgrounds. Others will rue the passing, having become aquatic enthusiasts themselves from such a childhood encounter.  They are survived on the prize shelf by Oversized Teddy Bears.
