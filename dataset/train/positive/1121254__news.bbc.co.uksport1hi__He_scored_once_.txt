Stoke led at half-time thanks to goals from Martin Kolar and Kevin Harper, either side of Dean Ashton's equaliser.  The Canaries then had Darren Huckerby sent off six minutes into the second half for foul and abusive language as he protested over a tackle.  Mamady Sidibe made victory certain for Stoke after 69 minutes to lift Johan Boskamp's team into the top seven.  Stoke manager Johan Boskamp:  "I'm very happy with how we played; we created plenty of chances. It pleased me most that we played good football and scored good goals. "The sending-off helped but our ball circulation was very good and Martin Kolar, Kevin Harper and Mamady Sidibe took their goals well. "It pleased me most that we played good football and scored good goals."  Norwich boss Nigel Worthington:  "I was unhappy with both goals in the first half. The defending wasn't up to the standard we expect. "Our play and passing up to then had been excellent. But you can't concede goals like we did in the first half."
