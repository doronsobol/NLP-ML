The final go-ahead for the scheme designed to ease congestion around Weymouth has been given by the county council's planning committee.  The 3.75km (2.3m) stretch of carriageway has been designed to tackle traffic jams along the A354 from Weymouth to Dorchester and the A353.  Protesters claim it will have a major adverse impact on the environment.  The road could be completed by 2011.
