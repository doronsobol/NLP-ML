Two men say they have set a record time for driving from Land's End to John O'Groats in an electric car.  Jonathan Porterfield, from Orkney, and Chris Ramsey, who lives in Aberdeen, completed the journey on Wednesday evening in 27 hours and 46 minutes.  Earlier in the week, the duo drove from John O'Groats to Land's End in 28 hours and 38 minutes.  They have submitted an application to Guinness World Records to have the quicker time recognised as a record.  The pair, who only used the existing public rapid charger infrastructure, had hoped to make the round trip in 48 hours.  Robert Llewellyn, who plays Kryten in the Red Dwarf comedy TV series and is an electric vehicle enthusiast, followed the pair's trip.  After the men reached Land's End, Llewellyn tweeted: "Well done guys. Great achievement. Hope you find time for a nap now."  Later, the actor added on Twitter: "@pluginadventure are 2 young chaps (barking mad of course) who drove John O'Groats-Lands End in a #NissanLeaf now they're on their way back."
