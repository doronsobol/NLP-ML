Jonah Ditton, 32, from Paisley, was insulted and sacked after eight days by CP Publishing Ltd and advised that he was not "psychologically balanced".  An employment tribunal awarded him £118,309 for discrimination on the grounds of his sexual orientation.  The Glasgow-based firm was not represented at the tribunal hearing.  At a hearing last month, Mr Ditton told tribunal chairman June Cape he had been depressed and upset as a result of his treatment.  He said he had expected to earn more than £80,000 a year but turned to drink and had to rely on benefits because he had been harassed and bullied.  He brought his tribunal claim against CP Publishing, which publishes entertainment listings, under the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2004.  "I do not feel my sexuality had any bearing on my ability to do my job. I was truly hurt and upset," he said.  "They are foul individuals and they should be punished as much as possible."  The tribunal heard Mr Ditton's boss Warren Paul had called him "a wee poof" and said he looked like "a cream puff".  Tribunal chairman Mrs Cape said: "The conduct of the respondent was high-handed, malicious, insulting and oppressive.  "Whilst the claimant was only employed for a short period, the respondent, and in particular Mr Paul, overtly abused and humiliated him on the grounds of his sexual orientation persistently over that period of time.  "He found himself being subject to daily abuse in front of those whom he was managing on the grounds of his sexual orientation."  She added: "The manner of his dismissal was humiliating and degrading."  Mr Ditton's award included £10,000 for injury to feelings, £76,937 for pecuniary loss, £5,291 interest and £26,081 for the company's failure to follow statutory procedures.
