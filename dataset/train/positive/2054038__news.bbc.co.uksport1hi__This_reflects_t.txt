This reflects the increasing dominance of the LPGA Tour, where almost all top European players spend most of their time.

In the past, the team comprised the top seven players in the Solheim Cup standings plus five captain's picks.  But in future, after the top five in the standings, priority goes to the four most highly-ranked non-qualifiers in the Rolex Women's world rankings.  The other places are at the discretion of team captain Helen Alfredsson.  "Hopefully this will mean that we can maximise the potential of the European team for The 2007 Solheim Cup at Halmstad," said Alfredsson, who serves as an advisor to the Cup Selection Committee.  "It's been very difficult to qualify over the past few years because of the high number of global playing opportunities and people play in so many different places.  "With this new method, more players can be included in the selection process but at the same time, the first five places on the team are given to the top players from the Ladies European Tour."  Laura Davies also gave her backing to the change.  "I think this is the best combination because it keeps it fair for the LET but it also rewards the Europeans who play elsewhere in the world," said Davies.  "By using the Rolex World Rankings, it gives everyone a chance to play their way into the team."
