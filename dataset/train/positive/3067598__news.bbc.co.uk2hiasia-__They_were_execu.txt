Letters have been sent to the men's families informing them of plans to carry out the executions at the end of August, Bali prosecutors said.  The three men - Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra - were sentenced to death in autumn 2003.  But prosecutors said the execution could be delayed if the men appealed for a judicial review of their case.  Made Suratmaja, the head of Denpasar's district attorney office, told Reuters news agency that the date of the execution could not be published until it had been carried out.  But he said the men, their lawyers and their families had been sent letters notifying them of preparations for the execution.  He said the sentences would be carried out on the prison island of Nusakambangan, where the men are being held.  On Wednesday, prosecutors in East Java said they had handed letters to relatives of the two convicted men that fell within their jurisdiction.  Other officials were quoted as saying the execution would be carried out on 22 August.  Two of the three men - Amrozi and Imam Samudra - said in October 2005 that they would not seek presidential clemency and were reported to have told prosecutors they were "ready to be executed anytime soon".  But a lawyer for Amrozi, Wiranan Adnan, told the Associated Press news agency that he planned to file a demand for a judicial review.  He did not reveal grounds for the appeal, but other lawyers said a challenge could be filed because the men were convicted of breaking a law passed after the attacks, AP said.  More than 30 people have been convicted over the October 2002 nightclub attacks, which killed more than 200 people.
