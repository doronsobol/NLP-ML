Andrew Elvin, of Epsom, was told he would serve a minimum of 12 years for the murder of Luke Salisbury, who was attacked at his home in March 2006.  The 30-year-old was stripped, then beaten and pushed down stairs. The assault was filmed on a mobile phone.  An 18-year-old, Caine Hallett, from Epsom, was also jailed at the Old Bailey for five years for manslaughter.  A third teenager, Danielle Reeves, 18, faces a retrial in May on a manslaughter charge.  The jury cleared her of murder but failed to reach a verdict on the alternative count of manslaughter.  The court had heard how Mr Salisbury was attacked at his home in Oaks Square because of an argument he had with Elvin's sister a few days earlier.  He was left unconscious after being beaten, kicked and stamped on and died three days later in Epsom General Hospital from severe head and chest injuries.  The senior investigating officer, Det Ch Insp Helen Collins said: "This was a truly horrific incident which has left a family devastated.  "The sentences are to be welcomed to show such actions will simply not be tolerated and hopefully act as a deterrent to others.  "Our sympathies must be with the victim's family who have had their lives changed for ever."  The Old Bailey judge lifted reporting restrictions preventing the media from identifying Elvin because of the seriousness of the case.
