The defender, 26, had been linked with a move away from the club after failing to secure a regular first-team place ahead of summer signing Ashley Cole.  But, after featuring in seven league games so far this season, he has committed his future to the champions.  "I feel like I'm playing well this term," he said. "I think I'll continue to get chances and so I'm delighted."  Bridge joined the club in 2003 from Southampton but was sent out on loan to Fulham last season.  However, after recovering from a broken leg, the left-back has forced his way back into Jose Mourinho's first-team reckoning this campaign.  The new contract come just days after Bridge's partner Vanessa gave birth to a boy and he said: "It's been a terrific week."  The England international, who had 18 months left on his previous deal, is expected to return to the Chelsea squad for Sunday's match against Manchester United having missed the Champions League defeat to Werder Bremen.
