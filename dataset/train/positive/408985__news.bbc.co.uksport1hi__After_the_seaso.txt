The former Dunfermline and Dundee midfielder faced budget cuts after helping Forfar avoid relegation from Division Two.  Farningham, who took over at Forfar in October, told The Sun: "I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at Forfar.  "But the opportunity at Gretna is just to good for me to turn down and I have to go for it."  Second Division champions Gretna are guaranteed Uefa Cup football next season after Hearts claimed a Champions League place.  Gretna manager Rowan Alexander said: "Ray worked for us before he joined Forfar. "I'm sure he will be a valuable addition to our set-up."
