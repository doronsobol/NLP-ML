And prices are expected to rise by 18% over the course of the year, compared with a UK forecast increase of 16%.  The Bank of Scotland figures also showed Kirkcaldy, Airdrie and Kilmarnock making it into the top 10 of UK property hotspots.  The average house price in Scotland is said to be £95,730 after an 11.9% increase over the spring quarter.  The figures were issued by the Bank of Scotland arm of the HBOS group.  Prices are now 23.1% higher than a year ago, after rises of 17% last year and 11.6% in 2002.  House prices remain highest in Edinburgh, where the average home costs £187,485, or 13% more than a year ago.  This compares with a UK average of £157,251, which is also outstripped by the Lothian average of £167,612, said the bank.  Bank economist Tim Crawford said: "House prices increased by almost 12% in the second quarter which is the highest quarterly rise we have seen in Scotland.  "Scottish housing trends traditionally react slower than the UK average and we expect house price inflation north of the border to ease back over the rest of the year."  Average prices in Kirkcaldy are now £113,444 compared to just £74,3000 in the spring of last year.  And construction of the new M77 extension has pushed prices in Kilmarnock up by 44% to £100,895 as the town becomes more attractive for commuting to Glasgow, the bank said.  House prices in Glasgow went up by 24% over the past year to an average £130,129, and high prices in Edinburgh have forced many buyers to look at West Lothian, putting pressure on prices there.  In Aberdeen an average house costs £114,670, up 12% since last spring.  In Dumfries and Galloway houses cost an average £112,278.  And Tayside and the Borders both saw prices rise by 43% over the year - in Tayside's case to £128,049, and to £134,647 in the Borders.
