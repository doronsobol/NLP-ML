An explosion followed by a fire at a gas plant in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas has killed 26 people.  Mexico's state oil company, Pemex, said the fire broke out at around lunchtime at its gas facility outside the city of Reynosa, near the border with the United States.  The cause of the blaze has not be established, but the company says the fire has now been extinguished.  Footage has shown the burning scene left behind.
