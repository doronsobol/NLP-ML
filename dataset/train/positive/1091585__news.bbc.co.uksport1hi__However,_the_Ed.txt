However, the Edinburgh-based club could not afford to sign Fuller on a permanent basis.

Ricardo Fuller is set to play his final game for Hearts on Sunday, according to his agent.  The lack of a television deal for next season's Scottish Premier League means that the highly-rated Jamaican forward will not be appearing at Tynecastle.  Hearts head coach Craig Levein was keen to hold on to the player valued at at Â£1m and who has impressed since joining on loan in October.  But his agent, Phillip Graham, admits that is now unlikely to happen.  "It is a shame, because Ricardo loves it at Hearts and would have loved to stay," he said.  "He is very happy in Edinburgh, but it is very unlikely Hearts will be able to do a deal."
