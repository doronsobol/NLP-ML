Parents had fought a long battle to keep East Brighton College of Media Arts, known as Comart, open.  But with the school found in 2004 to have a truancy rate almost nine times the UK average, the decision was made to close it at the end of this term.  Comart officially closes at the end of August, but as term ends on Thursday that will be the last day for pupils.  The comprehensive school has been through several changes of name and head teacher in recent years and was put into special measures after an Ofsted inspection in 2000.  This was lifted after another inspection in 2002, but the school was still beset by problems.  Out of the 3,579 schools in England it ranked 24th from bottom, according to data from the Department for Education and Skills (DfES).  Brighton and Hove City Council has considered keeping the site open as an education and skills training centre as part of City College expansion plans.  Comart's pupils are being moved to other schools in the Brighton and Hove area.
