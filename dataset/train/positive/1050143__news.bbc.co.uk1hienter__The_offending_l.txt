The offending lyrics being "I don't want to see a ghost/it's the sight that I fear most/I'd rather have a piece of toast/watch the evening news".

The offending lines are "I don't want to see a ghost/It's the sight that I fear most/I'd rather have a piece of toast/Watch the evening news".  Listeners to Marc Riley's BBC6 Music show have been voting for the past three weeks on a top 10 list of shame.  Second place went to Snap's Rhythm is a Dancer which goes "I'm as serious as cancer/ When I say rhythm is a dancer".  In third place was "And I met a girl/ She asked me my name/ I told her what it was" from Razorlight's 2005 hit Somewhere Else.  Other songs to make the top 10 are U2's Elevation (Been living like a mole now/ Going down, excavation), Champagne Supernova by Oasis (Slowly walking down the hall/ Faster than a cannonball) and Black Sabbath's War Pigs (Generals gathered in their masses/ Just like witches at black masses).  Riley said: "Bad lyrics can come in all forms - some acceptable, some less so.  "For instance, in the right hands, defiantly dumb lyrics such as Manfred Mann's Do Wah Diddy Diddy (diddy dum diddy do) can be more than acceptable as part of the pop idiom.  "In fact we embrace them. Let's not forget it was a number one smash.  "But imagine the same words streaming from the crown prince of gloom Leonard Cohen, accompanied only by a forlorn expression and a battered banjo.  "It would (quite rightly) be mocked and held up for much ridicule."  He added: "In short, dumb is sometimes OK, whereas pious and pretentious and pompous are obviously never to be encouraged nor tolerated."
