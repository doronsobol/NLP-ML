Levy made reference to this campaign on his radio show saying he could not read properly until he was ten and this is why he is passionate about campaigns such as this.

Popular BBC television presenter Peter Levy and weatherman Paul Hudson will be swapping their studio for several shopping malls when they embark on the 2006 Look North Sofa Tour this week.  The pair appear on the region's news magazine programme BBC Look North at 6.30pm on BBC ONE from Monday to Friday.  They will be in Freshney Place Shopping Centre, Grimsby, from 11.00am to 1.00pm on Thursday 9 February.  They will also be travelling to the Waterside Shopping Centre, Lincoln, on Thursday 16 February to meet and greet viewers.  Peter said: "We're really looking forward to meeting everyone who watches the programme, and hear about what they think of the show.  "These are the first two visits but we're hoping to get round most of the major shopping centres in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire over the coming year so please come along and say hello."  Peter has lived in Yorkshire since his late teens when he applied for a job on a new commercial radio station in the patch and was interviewed by renowned broadcaster Austin Mitchell.  He was hired and soon moved to TV where he became a familiar daytime BBC news reader throughout Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, as well as having his own BBC radio show.  He then moved to Hull to present BBC Look North's nightly news programme from studios in the city.  Paul was born and brought up in Keighley, near Bradford, and after reading geophysics and planetary physics at Newcastle University joined the Met Office and did two years at Leeds Weather Centre.  He combined this with a two-year stint as number two weather presenter for BBC Look North and for the BBC local radio stations in Leeds, York, Humberside and Sheffield before becoming the main weatherman.
