"It was one of the best performances I have ever given and especially against Stephen," said O'Sullivan.  "I made a 147 last year and lost and it would be nice to get another one, but you come here to win the tournament.  "It doesn't matter who I play in the final because when you've got this far you must have done something right."  O'Sullivan praised the advice he had received from Ray Reardon after clinching a place in the final.  The former champion has been a big help to O'Sullivan and the pair have struck up a good friendship.  "I cannot be specific about the advice I get because it is a professional thing between us.  "He respects my way and I respect his way. We get on really well. I enjoy his company and he enjoys mine."
