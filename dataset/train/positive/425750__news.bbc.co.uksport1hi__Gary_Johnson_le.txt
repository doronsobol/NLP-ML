Manager Gary Johnson has left Northampton Town by mutual consent after eight months in charge.  Saturday's extended the Cobblers' winless run to seven games.  Johnson, who was appointed Northampton manager in March, leaves with the club 20th in League Two.  "After discussions with the chairman, it was agreed that I part company with the club," said Johnson.  "I would like to thank the chairman for his support during my time here.  "I am sorry we did not reach the expectations we had set ourselves but I wish the club, it's players and supporters all the very best for the future."  Chairman David Cardoza added: "Unfortunately, things just haven't worked out for Gary here, and there comes a point when you have to accept that fact, take stock and make a decision.  "And following a discussion between Gary and I over the weekend, it was decided that we part company.  "Gary has been a successful manager in the past and I am sure he will be again in the future.  "We wish Gary all the very best for the future. We part on good terms and our search for a new manager now begins."  Assistant manager David Lee will take temporary charge of the first team, assisted by player-coach Andy Holt.  Johnson, who lasted just nine months in his last management job at Peterborough United, replaced Ian Sampson at Sixfields eight months ago.  The former Bristol City and Cambridge United boss kept the Cobblers in League Two with a victory in the penultimate game of last season, . At the time it was Northampton's first win in 19 games.  He set about rebuilding the Cobblers squad over the summer, overseeing a mass turnover of players, with a total of 25 new arrivals in the form of either loans or permanent signings.  And given the task of launching a promotion campaign at Sixfields, Johnson only managed to register four league wins this season before making his exit.
