Wolves have released United States international keeper Marcus Hahnemann after two seasons at Molineux.  Hahnemann, 38, joined Wolves on a free transfer from Reading in June 2009 and made 44 appearances for the Premier League club.  "Marcus has been fantastic for us - both in his performances on the pitch and influence off it," Wolves manager Mick McCarthy told the club's website  "He was a great character to have around the place."  Hahnemann is currently with his national team for the Gold Cup tournament in the United States.  McCarthy added: "It was a pleasure for all of us to have him in the squad for the last two years and we wish him all the very best for the next stage of his career."  Meanwhile, McCarthy said Wolves were determined to hold on to their prize assets, England winger Matt Jarvis and Republic of Ireland striker Kevin Doyle.  "If someone wants to try and take Matt and Kevin off us, any of our top stars, it is not going to be easy for them - and they are going to be expensive," he said.  "That's not saying they are for sale. They are not for sale.  "But neither was Cristiano Ronaldo a couple of years ago, neither were Fernando Torres and Andy Carroll this season - but £50m and £35m changed that a little bit!"
