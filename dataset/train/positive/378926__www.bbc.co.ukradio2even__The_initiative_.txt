Each performed two arias and was accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Martin Yates. They were judged by Dame Kiri, mezzo-soprano Anne Howells, conductor Robin Stapleton and director John Cox.      As part of her prize Shuna will join Dame Kiri Te Kanawa at BBC Proms in the Park in London’s Hyde Park on Saturday 11 September in front of an audience of thousands. Shuna, who is from Glasgow, is also invited to attend a three-week residential course at the Solti Te Kanawa Accademia in Italy.      Penny Smith presented the Final, which was launched in January 2010 and, following regional auditions, 40 singers were invited to attend masterclasses in London with Dame Kiri, Anne Howells and Robin Stapleton.      Dame Kiri says: "My fellow judges and I knew that choosing the winner would be a very hard decision due to the exceptional standard of the singers. We wanted to find a voice which was special - and we chose a singer who is uniquely special. We were looking for the performance of a lifetime from each of the finalists and that is what Shuna delivered."     Following training at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, Shuna graduated from the Alexander Gibson Opera School. Her work with the Scottish Opera includes roles in Madame Butterfly and Carmen.
