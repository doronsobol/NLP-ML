They are widely watched throughout the country, to the point that they have been described as a significant element in national identity and unity, and have been exported to over 120 countries.

You are in:          "The audience of telenovelas are of all social classes, but are mostly of course, the poor people.      The best actors, best actresses and best musicians of Brazil - the best of the best are on TV - doing telenovelas."          "In South America we love melodrama.       We need melodrama to survive. I think it’s our language. We have 40 million people watching it every day.       We are melodramatic in our music, poetry and soaps. You can find the same sensation in Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Chile."       ...I think Charles Dickens and Honore de Balzac are the fathers of the Brazilian Telenovela."         Brazil's dramatic soap operas, Telenovelas, as these fiction series are called, started nearly forty years ago. The first one, 25499 Busy (about a telephonist), ran every day from July to September 1963.       The telenovelas not only grip the nation but are sold to 120 countries around the world. They are made in Projac, Globo TV's huge production village twenty miles south of Rio de Janeiro.       One of the most popular telenovelas in 2000 is Terra Nostra the story of an Italian family that has recently emigrated to Brazil. The family saga is played out against a background of the creation of a Brazilian nation state. The theme tune runs "Our land, land of our dreams; hope your name is Brazil." Terra Nostra helps sustain a myth of the birth of Brazil. "It’s about roots,and the great influence of Italians in our country, at the end of the last century. Many people recognise their families in the story. 'Oh, my grandfather came in a ship like this.' That’s the success of the story." "About thirty years ago, Brazil was a lot of countries. It was South Brazil, North Brazil, and North East Brazil. I think TV has unified it. We are now one country. We used to be many different countries. We speak the same language. We know we are a country now.       The celebrity is boring, ok, but I know I am also responsible for its unification. I helped make this country a country." Jose Wilker, actor and star of Roque Santeiro, an outstanding Telenovela broadcast in the 1980s.    "The novela is a long, drawn out production. They used to be one hundred episodes long. Nowadays, there are two hundred. Structuring a long piece of work that runs 7-8 months is difficult.       The first 20 episodes grab the audience. That’s where the drama starts and the problems are all presented. The great enemy of the telenovela is when things stop happening and that tends to be around the 50th episode.       This is when you arrive to what we, the critics, call the belly of the series, the drop-off in the story. Everything sags. This has to happen. All the problems have to be saved up to be resolved for the end. So they create sub-plots i.e. more difficulties for the characters.       The really big problems are saved up for the end, which could be who is the son or father of whom or who killed who. These big questions are saved up for the end of the series.          "We talk about us. About our reality. Poor people. Rich. Our aspirations. Dreams. Love. Passion. Mostly hope... The telenovelas say, it’s possible to come from extreme poverty and become rich, but not often - we are good pupils of American cinema."         "Before in telenovelas, black characters only appeared as cooks, or chauffeurs, or in the novelas set in the olden days, they appeared as slaves. Lately, they have been trying to show black characters with the same status as white ones, with liberal professions, as characters who work in business. There’s also a political significance here. I don’t just mean in the administration of politics, but I mean social politics"
