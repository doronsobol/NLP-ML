The BBC reported that it was not clear whether this tour would simply take the place of the existing tour, or whether rival tours might develop.

It came about after a legal battle between the Professional Golfers Association of India (PGAI) and Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM).  TSM organised the previous Indian tour for eight years, but the PGAI annulled its contract in June.  But European Tour regular Jyoti Randhawa insisted: "This is not a breakaway tour, it is a tour."  The new tour is being run under the auspices of the Professional Golf Tour of India.  Confusion still lingers, however, with many domestic players refusing to ditch the PGAI and backing TSM to continue playing a role.  But Asian Tour player Gaurav Ghei urged his fellow players to join the new tour.  "Our tour is going to grow," he said. "The guys on the international tour have agreed to take time out to play on the domestic circuit."
