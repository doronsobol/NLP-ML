Skipper Paul Wotton suffered cuts to his head following a fracas involving Zebroski in a restaurant on 22 July.  "A disciplinary panel established by the Plymouth Argyle board has found Chris Zebroski guilty of gross misconduct," a club statement read.  "Therefore, the player's contract has been cancelled with immediate effect."  Zebroski made five substitute appearances for the Pilgrims last season after joining them from Cirencester Town.
