'And did those feet in ancient time' is a short poem by Blake from the preface to his epic Milton: a Poem (1804).  Blake was inspired by the legend that a young Jesus, accompanied by Joseph of Arimathea, visited England - making it heaven on earth. It was this poem that was put to music written by C. Hubert H. Parry in 1916 that is best known as the hymn 'Jerusalem'.  Does Britain need a new anthem? Should England have its own anthem? Have your say below.
