As Ball approached 60 appearances Rangers became reluctant to play him, as doing so would trigger a £500,000 payment to Everton.

Ball has been sidelined because he is close to triggering another payment to Everton, who sold him in 2001.  "The player signed a five-year contract and cost us £4m plus two payments of £500,000 should he play 60 games and then 90 games," said David Murray.  "But the worry is that he will play a few games, we will pay the £500,000 and he will suffer another injury."  Rangers manager Alex McLeish had hoped to sell Ball by the end of August, but the transfer window closed without any deals being done.  McLeish signed left-back Gregory Vignal on loan from Liverpool as a replacement for Ball, who has struggled to return to form since being out for almost two years with a serious knee injury.
