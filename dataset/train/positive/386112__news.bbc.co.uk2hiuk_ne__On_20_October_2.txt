But Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC agreed to halve these contributions to £30,000.  He added that they had "deliberately relegated" funds used to pay for their case to "the bottom of their list of priorities".  The couple were found guilty in 2003 of deception after winning the top prize in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?.  41-year-old Ingram, an ex-Army major, of Easterton, near Devizes, Wiltshire, his wife Diana and college lecturer Tecwen Whittock were given suspended prison sentences, fines and ordered to pay court costs.  In August the Ingrams asked for a reduction in their combined defence contribution of £65,000.  Judge Rivlin, sitting in London, ruled that Ingram's costs should be reduced from £40,000 to £25,000, and his wife's from £25,000 to £5,000.
