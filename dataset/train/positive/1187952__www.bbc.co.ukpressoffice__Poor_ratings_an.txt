Poor ratings and criticism of the program led to its cancellation in 2010.

Drama on the BBC's Asian Network is to be reorganised to deliver more impact and better value for money the corporation has announced today.  The changes will see new monthly single dramas being produced for the Asian Network â€“ replacing Silver Street, the BBC Asian Network's five-minute daily soap.  Andy Parfitt, Controller, BBC Asian Network, said: "Silver Street has played an important role establishing the Asian Network as a national station. The production team, writers and cast can be proud of what they've achieved. However, as with all long-running series, it's important to assess their value and impact for the investment made and we've decided that there is a better way to deliver drama to our audiences.  "We remain committed to producing distinctive drama that our audiences will enjoy and full-length monthly dramas will be produced for the Asian Network instead."  Alison Hindell, Head of BBC Radio Drama, adds: "The new drama strand will cover a broad selection of stories and styles designed to deliver a higher profile for the genre, bigger names on the network and the development of new talent, both on- and off-air. The new format will be ambitious in scope and will create a richer range of drama programming for listeners to enjoy."  The new half-hour monthly dramas will launch in summer 2010.  Silver Street started in May 2004 and currently runs as five-minute episodes from Monday to Friday at 12.15pm and as an omnibus on Sundays at 4.35pm.
