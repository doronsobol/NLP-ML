West Bromwich Albion striker Danny Dichio believes moving to the Midlands will help him regain his starting position with the Division One high-flyers.  Last season the 28-year-old commuted to the Hawthorns from the south of England but he has now moved north with his family.  Dichio said: "My family are all up here now and the boys like it here.  "It's a lot of pressure off my mind travelling wise, having to do a 30-minute drive instead of the hour-and-a-half I used to do.  "The little one is at school and he is gaining a bit of a Brummie accent now."
