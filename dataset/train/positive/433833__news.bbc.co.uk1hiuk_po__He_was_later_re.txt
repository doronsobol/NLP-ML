Colin Pickthall was first elected to the Commons in 1992 after working as an English lecturer>  He is viewed as being on the mainstream left of the party and campaigns strongly on environmental issues and on animal welfare.  Mr Pickthall is a particular opponent of hunting and hare coursing. He also remains a member of CND.  However, despite those apparently leftish leanings, he is loyal to the party leadership.  He earned promotion in 1997 as parliamentary private secretary to Alun Michael, and later moved to serve Jack Straw.  He resigned in 2000 over a police investigation in to his election expenses, but after the investigation came to nothing he was reinstated, and in 2001 followed Mr Straw to the Foreign Office, a role he continues to perform.
