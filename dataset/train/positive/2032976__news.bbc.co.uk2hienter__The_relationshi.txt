The couple ended their three-year relationship at the end of January, said Lee Anne Devette, who the star has recently hired as his publicist.  Ms Devette added it was an "amicable" break-up while Cruz's spokesman said they "remain good friends".  The Hollywood pair got together after Cruise, 41, separated from wife Nicole Kidman in 2001.  In January, Cruz, 29, attended a number of premieres around the world with Cruise as he promoted his movie The Last Samurai, including in London and Japan.  But they have also spent long periods apart because of filming commitments.  The Last Samurai was largely filmed in New Zealand while Mission Impossible 3 took Cruise on location to Belgium and Canada.  Spanish actress Cruz's filming commitments have also taken her across the globe.  Cruz's spokesman, Robert Garlock, told People magazine neither star was dating anyone else.  Cruise recently ended a 14-year association with his publicist, Pat Kingsley, considered one of Hollywood's most powerful public relations people.  There were rumours the business relationship finished because of his increasing involvement in the Scientology religion.  Cruise took on his sister Lee Anne - who is also a Scientologist - as a replacement .  Cruz's publicist said the actress had not become a Scientologist "but she has taken [church] courses and she's found them beneficial".  He said Cruise's religion was not involved in the split.  The actor has two adopted children from his marriage to Kidman, which ended after 10 years.
