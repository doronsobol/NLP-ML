An investigation has been launched after a tram carriage toppled over on the Isle of Man, causing services to be suspended on the Manx Electric Railway.  No-one was injured in the incident, which happened north of Laxey Station at about 10:00 BST.  An eyewitness said the trailer was being reversed at the time, with only members of crew on board.  Isle of Man Railways said services between Laxey and Ramsey were likely to resume by 12:00 on Wednesday.  The route between Douglas and Laxey remains unaffected.  A spokesman said the trailer concerned dates back to 1904.  "It was not in public service at the time and no passengers were on board during what was a routine shunt," he continued.  "A full investigation into the incident is under way to establish the cause of the derailment."  The Manx Electric Railway, which was built between 1893 and 1899, is a popular tourist attraction connecting the towns of Douglas, Laxey and Ramsey.  The service operates on the eastern coast of the island with the majority of its Victorian & Edwardian era infrastructure and rolling stock still in use.
