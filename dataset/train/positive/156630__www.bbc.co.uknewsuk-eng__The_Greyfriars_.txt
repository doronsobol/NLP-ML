A series of sharp bangs, a dramatic pause... and then the collapse.  The Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, dubbed "like a great big mouth of hell" by TV presenter Kevin McCloud, has taken its final gasp as more than 2,000 individual explosive charges were used to "initiate a collapse" at about 09:40 GMT, reducing it to rubble in seconds.  David Mackintosh, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said the demolition, which cost more than Â£4m "has removed an expensive eyesore from Northampton".  Retail and leisure schemes are now being considered for the site.
