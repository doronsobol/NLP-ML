With the Bluebirds striving to clear debts of £30m, the Wales centre back knows he could soon be sold if the club receives an offer too good to refuse.  "Obviously the club's not in the best of shapes at the moment," said Gabbidon, who is contracted until 2008.  "I'm sure a few things will happen in the summer to sort that out, but who knows where I'll be?"  After promising to build a squad capable of challenging for promotion to the Premiership, owner Sam Hammam has been forced to sell his best players to raise much needed funds.  Top scorer Robert Earnshaw was the first to leave last August when West Brom paid £3m for the Wales striker.  The Cardiff fans then watched with horror as captain Graham Kavanagh was sold to rivals Wigan for £400,000 in March.  Kavanagh's departure came shortly after the depth of the club's financial plight was revealed in official accounts.  That week, the club had also failed to pay its monthly wage bill of around £750,000.  Gabbidon's defensive partner Tony Vidmar, who is joining Dutch side NAC Breda, has said Gabbidon needs to leave Cardiff to further his career.  But 25-year-old Gabbidon says he has no desire to find a new club.  "Vids and I are good friends and that's his opinion," Gabbidon, who joined Cardiff from West Brom in 2000, told BBC Wales Sport.  "I've been very happy with my time at Cardiff. I've had some great memories and I can't thank the club enough.  "The [financial] situation's not good at the moment but hopefully that can improve.  "We'll have to see what happens. It's probably out of my hands so we'll wait and see."
