The John Peel Centre for Creative Arts is to reopen following the completion of the final stage of building work.  A mezzanine floor, two bars, toilets and wooden dancefloor are among the Â£1m additions at the Stowmarket venue, which closed in July.  It will reopen on Friday night and hold a series of "test events" before a grand opening in the spring.  Andy Stringer, chairman of the centre, said: "It looks radically different to six months ago."  Radio 1 DJ Peel lived in the Stowmarket area for many years before his death in 2004.  The 220 capacity venue, which used to be the Corn Exchange, will be run by a community interest company.
