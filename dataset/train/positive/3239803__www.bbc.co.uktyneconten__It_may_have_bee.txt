It may have been built on the site of a Roman fort.

Residents have got together to protect an ancient Christian monument that stands smack bang in the middle of their estate north of Newcastle.  The chapel, now a scheduled ancient monument, dates from the 12th century.  It's believed the grassed area around the Chapel was used as a burial site, right up until the 18th century.  It's believed to have been destroyed by fire in 1690 and never rebuilt.  Brian Hutchins is treasurer of the growing group of Friends of North Gosforth Chapel.  They aim is to retain and preserve the 12th century monument on their doorstep.  When he and his wife moved into their house in Chapel Close, Melton Park in Gosforth 27 years ago the relic was literally a pile of stones in long grass.  Listen again to Chris Hodder speaking to Brian Hutchins on BBC Radio Newcastle's Sunday Breakfast.
