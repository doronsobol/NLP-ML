Air links between Yemen and Eritrea are to re-start after an international tribunal ended a territorial dispute between the two countries.  A Yemeni government spokesman said the decision was taken by President Ali Abdallah Saleh following a telephone call with his Eritrean counterpart Issaias Afeworki.  The official Yemeni news agency SABA said that both presidents affirmed their eagerness for relations to improve, following the settling by an international tribunal of their dispute over the Hanish Islands in the Red Sea.  The tribunal, sitting in London on Friday, ruled that sovereignty over the islands, which lie in a key shipping lane, should be shared by Yemen and Eritrea.  Twelve people died in clashes between the two countries in December 1995.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
