The 300m channel has been designed to replace the old Two Mile Bend part of the canal, which is to be closed as part of the A40 south-west bypass.  A group of schoolchildren dressed as pirates marked the channel's opening with a voyage on the King Arthur.  The next stage of the project will see a four-lane swing bridge built across the canal. It is due to open next year.  When it is completed in April 2007, the Â£43m Gloucester south-west bypass will provide the city with a new link to the M5.
