Logan is one of six Australian-based players in the Scotland squad Scotland have named ex-Hull and Wigan forward Scott Logan, the only survivor from the last World Cup, in their squad for this year's tournament. The 32-year-old prop, who played all three of his country's matches in 2000, is one of six Australian-based players. Winger Michael Robertson is included in Steve McCormack's 24-man line-up after missing out on the Australia squad. Scotland, who will be led by Danny Brough, have been drawn in a group that also includes France and Fiji. Robertson, 25, is in prime form after scoring a hat-trick in Manly's 40-0 Grand Final triumph over Melbourne on Sunday. "Mick made it very plain at the beginning of the year that he would be proud and privileged to play for Scotland and I've followed his progress all year," McCormack said. "He has been absolutely outstanding and he was superb on Sunday. "You always worry if people are going to pick him up but he's committed to Scotland and I'm delighted we've got him on board." Of his team's chances, McCormack added: "There is no doubt that we are the underdogs in our group but we are quietly confident that, as always, our pride and spirit will shine through in our performance" The Scotland team will be based in Sydney for the first four days of their World Cup before going into training camp in Canberra ahead of the game against France on 26 October. Â“I am very happy with the make-up of the squad as we have a great degree of versatility in there which will be needed with at least three games in relatively quick succession," added McCormack. "We also have an outstanding leader in Danny Brough, who, I believe, will show the world of rugby league exactly what he can do." The squad also includes Henderson brothers Andrew, Ian and Kevin.
