A former Conservative Sussex MP is to take the man who beat him at the general election to court over comments he made about his expenses claims.  Lawyers for Nigel Waterson, who was Eastbourne MP until 2010, confirmed he was to sue Stephen Lloyd for libel.  The action is to centre on a leaflet produced by his Liberal Democrat successor during the 2010 general election campaign.  Mr Waterson was cleared of any wrong-doing over his expenses claims.  Both Mr Waterson and Mr Lloyd said they could not comment on the issue.
