A strong Villa line-up went behind after just nine minutes when Graham Branch headed in Robbie Blake's cross.  Blake, who was otherwise superb, had a penalty saved early in the second half but not long after Burnley struck again through a header from Mo Camara.  Juan Pablo Angel replied with another header but Louis Valois' run and shot ended any hopes of a Villa comeback.  Villa boss David O'Leary showed he was taking the Carling Cup seriously by naming his strongest possible line-up against Burnley - who are struggling in 16th in the Championship.  But Blake, playing as a lone striker, outshone the efforts of Villa frontmen Carlton Cole and Angel.  After setting up the opening goal for Branch, the Burnley skipper embarrassed Liam Ridgewell with his skill wide on the left before forcing a vital deflection from Olof Mellberg.  But the striker's firmly struck spot-kick was well saved well by Thomas Sorensen low to his right.  Villa's attack only came alive after Camara converted Burnley's second.  The ineffective Nolberto Solano was replaced by Luke Moore and the youngster provided the cross for Angel to reduce the deficit.  But as Villa desperately sought the goal that would have forced extra time, Burnley sealed a superb win through Valois' sweet shot into the top corner.
