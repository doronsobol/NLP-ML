They stand 10 feet in height with a chrome finish and act as 24-hour information points, with three screens providing information on crime prevention, police force recruitment and tourist information.

The box, which doubles as a 24-hour information point, can connect callers to a police CCTV control room operator.  The kiosk also provides safety advice, counselling information, directions and places to visit through a cash machine-style keypad.  Strathclyde Police said despite looking more like a Dalek than a "Tardis" box, it was there to help the public.  Chief Superintendent David Christie said: "The police box is an excellent addition to the policing of the city centre.  "It will not replace the officer on the beat but will serve to enhance the high level of service already provided.  "Unlike a police officer, the box is static and therefore people will always know where they are able to access information and get help if required."  The force said that if the box proved successful, more could be rolled out all over Strathclyde.  The current kiosk is located in front of the underground station in Glasgow's St Enoch Square.  Douglas Anderson, who designed the new box, said: "I thought it would be of benefit to bring the symbolic presence of the old police box back in to the city but in a more up-to-date format.  "This meant reversing the use of the box from an internal refuge for police officers to a structure that is visible and that the public can use."
