Prince Charles will marry his long-term partner Camilla Parker Bowles on 8 April, Clarence House says.  Mrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after the civil ceremony at Windsor Castle.  When the Prince of Wales, 56, becomes king, 57-year-old Camilla will not be known as Queen Camilla but as the Princess Consort, Clarence House added.  Princes William and Harry said they were "very happy" and wished the couple "all the luck in the future".  Charles said he and his wife-to-be were "absolutely delighted".  The move will end years of speculation on a relationship which has spanned the decades since they first met in 1970.  The wedding will be a civil ceremony, which will be followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George's Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.
