However, an unnamed Liverpool-based buyer purchased all 13 properties on 17 December 2008 for £735,000, although by this time, the Close was in a sorry state of disrepair and once again, speculation mounted as to what would happen to the disintegrating houses of Brookside Close.

The infamous Brookside cul-de-sac that once saw its residents murdered, taken hostage and buried under a patio has sold for £735,000 at auction.  An unnamed Liverpool-based buyer has snapped up all 13 properties of Brookside Close, in Liverpool's West Derby estate.  The Channel 4 soap was axed five years ago after a run of more than two decades.  A spokesman for auctioneer Allsop said the buyer was "local to Liverpool".  Brookside Close was originally bought by Mersey Television in 1982 to try to cover the costs of the show and to provide a more realistic set than some of their rival soaps.  Six of the houses were on-screen as sets and the remaining seven were used to house the administration, post-production, canteen, make-up and technical facilities for cast and crew.  The 13 leasehold houses were bought in 2005 by developers, who refurbished all of them.  But they have remained vacant since and the street requires some work, Allsop said.
