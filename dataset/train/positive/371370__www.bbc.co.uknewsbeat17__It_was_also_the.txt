It was also their first and only US hit, where it reached number seven, and at the time was the highest ever charting single by a British boy band in the US.

The Wanted have become the highest charting UK boy band in the US charts.  The group have climbed to number five with their track Glad You Came, which saw a boost in sales after it was featured on TV show Glee.  The track, a former UK number one, beats Take That's Back For Good, from 1995, which made it to number seven.  Another UK boy band, One Direction, are at number 50 in the official US Billboard Hot 100 Chart with What Makes You Beautiful.  The Wanted singer Jay McGuiness said: "We're proud that Glad You Came is doing so well.  "The British are smashing it at the minute in the US, and it's great to feel like we're helping steer that."  Max George added: "It feels like City have just reached the final of the FA Cup. Now we just need to win it."  Glad You Came has a total radio audience in America of more than 50 million, having been played on more than 160 pop stations.  The track was downloaded 188,000 times last week and has now sold more than 300,000 copies.  Unlike the UK charts, the US charts are based on both airplay and sales.  The Wanted are the first boy band to hit the top 10 on the US airplay chart since the Backstreet Boys.  The group, who have just finished their US tour and are now back in the UK, will perform live on the Jay Leno show later this month.  They have already sung live on the Ellen show and Chelsea Lately.
