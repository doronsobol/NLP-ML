Mawaan Rizwan was brought up in a religious family but is no longer practising and feels detached from spirituality.  He visits the Oklevueha Native American Church in Salt Lake City in Utah, America, where people take the Class A drug peyote in the hope of finding religious enlightenment. A powerful hallucinogen, its active ingredient mescaline puts peyote in the same category as heroin. Its effects are like that of LSD.

A sceptical but curious Mawaan joined them on one of their ceremonial retreats in the mountains.  Watch Episode 1: Trip to the Mountains of BBC Three's Getting High for God?.
