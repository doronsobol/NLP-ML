The 19-year-old has been a member of City's senior squad this season but will get his first taste of first-team football at Boundary Park.  "I want to come here and play my football. Hopefully I can show the Oldham fans what I'm made of," Croft told Oldham's website.  Croft has been given permission by City boss Kevin Keegan to play for Oldham in their FA Cup tie at Thurrock on Sunday.
