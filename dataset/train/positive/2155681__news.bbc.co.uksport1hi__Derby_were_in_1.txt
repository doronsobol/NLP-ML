Former Bolton assistant manager Brown took charge at Pride Park in June 2005, agreeing a three-year deal as George Burley's replacement.  But he has struggled to convince with The Rams, who are currently 19th in the Championship and were dumped out of the FA Cup by League One side Colchester.  A statement from Derby on Monday said: "We would like to thank Phil for the time and effort he has given."  The club is to make an announcement on Tuesday regarding an interim management team which will be in place until a new appointment is made.  Ex-Bolton defender Brown was in charge of Derby for 33 games in total, winning seven, drawing 14 and losing 12.  The 3-1 FA Cup loss at Colchester followed a 6-1 league hammering at Coventry.  As recently as Saturday, Brown re-affirmed his committment to the job, saying: "We all have to take responsibility, including the players.  "It is a very, very difficult situation but not insurmountable."  He has been busy in the transfer market, bringing in Darren Moore from West Brom on 26 January - and wrapping up the signing of former Sporting Lisbon player Silva on a month-long loan earlier on Monday.
