Dancer Lionel Blair had just finished filming a pilot programme with comedian Alan Carr when they heard a man was trying to jump from the North Pier.  By the time the entertainers reached the end of the pier the man was holding on by his fingertips, but they managed to grab him.  Police said the man was unharmed and was now at home with his family.  The pair had just finished filming Alan Carr's End-of-the-Pier Show in North Pier's Sun Lounge when the drama unfolded.  "The guy that looks after the pier came running into the bar where we were having a drink and said, 'Can anybody help me? There's a guy trying to commit suicide'," Mr Blair told the BBC.  The dancer and comedian followed the man.  "We got there and there was a man clinging on," said Mr Carr, star of Channel 4's Friday Night Project.  Picking up the story, Mr Blair added: "We got his hand and said, 'Come on, you don't want to die. You can't do that. Listen to us'.  "He did a double take, but then said, 'No I want to go'. So I got one arm and you [turning to Alan Carr] got the other."  The pair then pulled him back up from the edge as the police began to arrive.  Lancashire Police confirmed there was an incident at the North Pier on Wednesday night.  They said a man was arrested but then returned uninjured to the care of his family.
