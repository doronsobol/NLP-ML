Nigeria has introduced a new 100-naira note, worth about one US dollar, but it is proving surprisingly unpopular.  Like many African countries, Nigeria has seen the value of its national currency decline steeply in recent years.  In the 1970s, the Nigerian naira was on a par with the pound sterling. Now there are 160 naira to the pound.  But whereas most governments responded to the decline in their currencies' value by printing bigger and bigger banknotes, Nigeria resisted the trend, believing it would accelerate inflation.  But with the the introduction this month of the new note the situation has changed.  The 100-naira note was controversial long before any Nigerians got their hands on it.
