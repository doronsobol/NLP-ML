Stewart, who plays Pc Reg Hollis, was taken to hospital on Tuesday following an "incident".  The 52-year-old, who has been in the show since it began in 1984, had been told his contract would not be renewed.  Stewart said: "I love being an actor... and the thought of this changing had an extremely serious effect on me."  He added: "I want to reassure and thank everyone for all their support and good wishes.  "The last few days have been very difficult for me, but I am receiving the right care and help, and am surrounded by family and friends.  "I want to confirm that I do not have any financial concerns, or indeed any other problems, as has been reported."  Stewart was taken to hospital on Tuesday after an ambulance was called to the set in Merton, south west London.  A spokeswoman for The Bill refused to confirm details of what happened, but said there had been an "incident".  Stewart added: "I am feeling much better now, and am progressively improving.  "I have very much appreciated the kind messages of support from members of the public and other people in the business."
