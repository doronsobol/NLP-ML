Mr Mattinson, 39, a self-employed contractor for Keswick Super Glaze has now won the title six times.  Ann Woods of Egremont regained her women's crown which she lost in 2002 to TV presenter Michaela Strachan who was covering the Egremont Crab Fair for BBC's Countryfile.  A host of ugly mugs took part in the contest at the weekend.  Contestants put their heads through a horse collar and contorted their faces into the most gruesome or daft expressions possible.  The competition has taken place at the Egremont Crab Fair since medieval times and attracts competitors from all over the world.  People living in the Cumbrian village have celebrated crab apple time since 1267 when King Henry III granted a Royal Charter for a weekly market and an annual crab fair.
