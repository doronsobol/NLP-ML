Aviation enthusiasts in the West have been celebrating 100 years of flying history in Bristol.  Aircraft production began in Filton in 1910, less than two years after the first recorded flight of a powered aeroplane in British skies.  The Boxkite biplane was a big success for the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company (BCAC) - BCAC was renamed the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1920.  The factory at Filton was the largest in Europe by the start of World War II.  BBC Radio Bristol took part in a day of celebrations on Friday, 19 February, 2010 to mark the centenary.  Events included a special flight from Bristol International Airport to Filton which took off on Friday morning.  After the plane - the newly named 'Sir George White' easyJet Airbus A319 - landed in Filton, there were a number of speeches which detailed the history of aviation in Bristol since 1910 - the script was produced by Airbus and included actors wearing Edwardian dress.  The anniversary flight then returned to Bristol International Airport and landed at around 12.40pm.  In April 2003, British Airways and Air France jointly announced the retirement of their Concorde fleets.  The supersonic airliner has a long association with Bristol, being designed and assembled both at Filton and in France.  On 26 November 2003, the Bristol Aero Collection and Airbus UK were lucky enough to receive the last Concorde built, when G-BOAF landed at Filton for preservation.  This was also the last ever flight by Concorde.  You can listen to the programme again via the BBC iPlayer for seven days after the event.
