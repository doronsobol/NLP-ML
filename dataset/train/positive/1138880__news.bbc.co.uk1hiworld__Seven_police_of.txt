A prominent advocate for constitutional reform in Zimbabwe, Lovemore Madhuku, has criticised the police for firing on rioting football fans after a match in the city of Bulawayo on Sunday.  Two football fans were shot during the incident - one is reported to be in a critical condition.  Professor Madhuku said police responded to the situation with what he described as impunity.  He said the heavy-handed response reflected the current political tensions in Zimbabwe.  Seven police were also injured and five vehicles badly damaged.  The violence broke out when players of the local team disputed a refereeing decision.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
