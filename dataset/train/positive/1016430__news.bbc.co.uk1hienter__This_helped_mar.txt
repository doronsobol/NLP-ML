Slade frontman Noddy Holder will make a cameo appearance on the live episode of Coronation Street on Friday.  The seventies glam rocker will appear in the Rovers Return as a character called Stan, helping the cast mark the 40th anniversary of the soap.  Granada Television is expecting an audience of 20 million viewers for the ITV programme.  The singer said: "I am looking forward to it. I am a real fan of the Street.  "I am not nervous but I think some of the other cast are."  Slade had a string of hits in the 70s, including Coz I Luv You and Merry Xmas Everyone.  Granada is not releasing details of Noddy's part but it has confirmed he will be speaking in the episode.  A spokesman said: "This is one of the rather fun elements that we have introduced to the special.  "Everyone is really excited. It is part of TV history. It is a big stage so obviously there are a few nerves but everyone is looking forward to it."  As the episode will be broadcast at night the cast have had to rehearse many of the scenes in the evening as part of their preparations.  However, John Savident, who plays butcher Fred Elliott, will not be appearing in the episode following an alleged attack on the performer at his Manchester flat.  Meanwhile, bookmakers William Hill are offering odds on what might happen in the live show.  They include short odds of 1-3 on an actor fluffing his or her lines, 3-1 on tight-fisted Les Battersby buying a round, and 16-1 on scenery falling over.
