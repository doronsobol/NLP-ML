"They are in good health and no ransom was paid," a spokesman for their employer, Egyptian telecoms giant Orascom, told the AFP news agency.  The four men were seized from their home in the affluent neighbourhood of al-Mansour on Sunday.  Foreigners working for multinational firms have been regularly targeted by hostage-takers in Iraq.  The men - named as Mohammed al-Saadi, Hussein Ashour, Waleed Ismail and Sayed Shaaban - were released when US forces raided a house, Orascom's chairman, Naguib Sawiris, told Egyptian television.  However, an Egyptian diplomat told the Associated Press news agency the employees were freed by US troops manning a checkpoint.  Several arrests had been made, he said.  Last September, insurgents kidnapped more than 10 employees of Orascom's Iraqi subsidiary, mobile operator Iraqna, releasing them later on.
