Mr Barrymore, 55, and two men, aged 37 and 32, were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of sexual assault and murder.  Mr Lubbock, 31, was found near the swimming pool at the entertainer's home near Harlow, Essex, in March 2001.  The 37-year-old man has been taken away for medical treatment and questioning will continue when he returns to where he is being held, police said.  A group of Mr Barrymore's fans gathered outside South Woodham Ferrers police station on Friday morning holding a poster saying "we love Michael".  Mr Barrymore's solicitor arrived at the station and when asked how his client was coping, he replied: "Fine."  A warrant for further detention in relation to a 37-year-old man arrested in Lancashire is not yet needed and a decision will be made later.  Mr Barrymore had hosted a party at his former house in Roydon in the hours before Mr Lubbock's body was found.  An inquest in 2002 into the death recorded an open verdict.  The inquest heard Mr Lubbock suffered severe internal injuries which suggested he had been the victim of a serious sexual assault.  An investigation was carried out by Essex Police, but no-one was charged with any offence in connection with his death.  The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) also launched an investigation.  Following Thursday's arrests, the IPCC put on hold its inquiry into complaints made by the Lubbock family about the original Essex Police investigation.  Mr Lubbock's father, Terry, 62, of Harlow, said: "My life has been on hold. I will never get those six years back again. Why has it taken so long?  "I have had so many disappointments over the past six years. This could be another one."
