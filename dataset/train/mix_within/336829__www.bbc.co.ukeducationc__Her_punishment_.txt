Anne Boleyn was convicted of treason and adultery and sentenced to her death on 19th May 1536. Professor Greg Walker argues that Anne did sleep with Mark Heaton who was a court musician and with the leading member of Henryâ€™s Privy Chamber, Henry Norris. Therefore she was guilty.On the other hand Suzannah Lipscomb argues that there is evidence to support that Anne did not commit the crime of adultery because one can disprove the majority of stories. She states that the stories of adultery were made up to make sure that Anne did not come out alive.
