Serbs, who were opposed to IzetbegoviÄ‡, often quoted the declaration as indicative of an intent to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Bosnia.

Police in the Bosnian capital said the blast happened at 0300 (0100 GMT) on Friday, at the domed monument in the Kovaci (Martyrs) Cemetery.  Izetbegovic, who died in October 2003 aged 78, led Bosnia to independence in 1992, angering Bosnian Serbs.  He led the country in the 1992-95 war against Serb and Croat nationalists.  Bosnian public radio said the blast destroyed the marble tombstones, but the dome over the grave remained intact.  Police sealed off the cemetery and launched a major investigation.  About 110,000 people died in the Bosnian war and more than two million fled their homes.
