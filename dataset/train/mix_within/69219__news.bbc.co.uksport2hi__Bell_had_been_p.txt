Bell had been picked in the first game after the Second World War in the 1946 season and did not miss a match until he was dropped on 30 August 1955, a total of 459 consecutive appearances for a British team, a record which still holds in 2011.

Steve Mungall will end a 21-year career at Tranmere Rovers when he leaves for a business career at the end of October.  Mungall, 42, played 624 times for Tranmere from 1979 to 1996 and is currently head of the club's centre of excellence.  But he has now decided to leave football altogether and link up with a friend who is opening a branch of his Glasgow-based steel business in the Manchester area.  "I've been with the club for 21 years and Tranmere will always be a place I have fond memories of and it will be strange when I finally leave," Mungall told the official Tranmere Rovers website.  "People ask me about my best moments during my time here and I'd have to say the win over Exeter in 1987 is up there with the best of them. We had to win to stay in the league and to win that game was extremely rewarding.  "After that, the club never really looked back as it went on its roller-coaster ride. My Wembley appearances, promotions and helping the club establish itself in the First Division are all moments I'll look back on fondly."  Tranmere chairman Lorraine Rogers said: "Our commitment to youth development remains as strong as ever and we will be looking to appoint a succesor as soon as possible.  "In the meantime, our current team of Warwick Rimmer, John McMahon and Glyn Salmon will carry on as normal. Training and fixtures for the Centre of Excellence will not be affected".
