The move caused a massive drop in attendance and a heavy financial loss, leading to debts which hung over the organisation.

More than 100 people contacted this website after news of the ban was released by the organisers.  At the time organisers claimed the move was due to "feedback" and was to "keep the atmosphere over the weekend fun, friendly and family orientated".  But Mr Hunt told BBC Radio Bristol's John Turner the reason was down to the conditions of this year's licence.  "When you eventually get a licence you always get ... lots of conditions attached to it. I'm afraid this year they're saying that we're not allowed to have people bringing alcohol into the event.  "If we don't comply with that we don't have a licence," he said.  "Under the new licensing regime you have something called a premises supervisor and this person is responsible for all alcoholic sales on the event.  "That also includes people who are coming into the event who have bought their own alcohol. If these people then sell alcohol to people under 18, or encourage drunkenness, it is this person's livelihood on the line."  Festival-goer David Nolan said he was "disappointed" with the way the news had been conveyed to the city.  "When this information was released to the community in Bristol there was no mention of the fact that the organisers are coming under pressure from the licensing authorities."
