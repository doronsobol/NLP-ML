As The Langham was just across the road from Broadcasting House, it was in constant use as an additional broadcast and support facility in the 1940s. Its proximity to the BBC also made it vulnerable to attack in World War II. On 16 September 1940, Broadcasting House came under intense fire from Luftwaffe raiders who destroyed a large section of the hotelâ€™s west wing.  The BBC's wartime staff used to broadcast from the roof of The Langham, in particular the US correspondent Edward Murrow. JB Priestley was also a regular guest in this period - in order to be close to Broadcasting House for his frequent late-night transmissions of Britain Speaks to North America. Finally, General De Gaulle also stayed for periods at The Langham, when recording his famous broadcasts to occupied France from Broadcasting House.
