The BBC's 2004 annual report comes after a turbulent year The facts and figures from the BBC's annual report 2003-2004. BBC complaints-handling processes are being reformed to make them clearer, fairer and more responsive. Management is implementing all the proposals from the recent Neil Review, including revised editorial guidelines and procedures, and improvements in the training of BBC journalists. BBC staff, and regular freelance journalists whose main profile or income comes from the BBC, are no longer allowed to write newspaper or magazine columns on current affairs or other contentious issues BBC One reached more of its potential audience than last year and, in research, audiences judged it to be the channel offering the best quality output in 12 out of 22 genres. Research suggests audiences perceive BBC Two as offering the best range in seven genres and quality in six. Launched in February 2003, BBC Three now regularly reaches over a fifth of its core audience of 25-34 year olds each week. Since its launch in March 2002, BBC Four has become the most watched channel of its kind. The Alan Clark Diaries, co-commissioned with BBC Two, averaged 856,000 viewers during its first episode - one of the highest recorded audiences for an original drama on a UK digital channel. The CBBC Channel has improved its performance and now reaches nearly a million viewers a week. CBeebies is now the most watched children's channel and the CBeebies website has become one of the most popular BBC sites. With Radio 1, BBC Governors' said it was too early to make an informed assessment of the station's refreshed schedule, but it had been successful in ensuring 45 percent of its playlist were UK artists. Radio 2 held its audience in a crowded marketplace, retaining its position as the UK's most popular radio station with an average weekly reach in 2003/2004 of 12.9 million (13.0 million in 2002/2003). Radio 3's audience marginally increased, with an average weekly reach in 2003/2004 of 2.2 million (2.1 million in 2002/2003). Radio 4's audience was slightly down, with reach at 9.6 million in 2003/2004 (9.8 million in 2002/2003). In London, the most competitive radio marketplace, the network remains top for reach and share. Radio Five Live audiences remained broadly stable, with a small drop in average reach to 6.1 million in 2003/2004 (from 6.3 million in 2002/2003 - which included the Football World Cup). It reached 6.5 million in quarter one of 2004, and audience approval scores remain well above the BBC average. Overall, the global radio audience to BBC World Service fell slightly to 146 million weekly listeners (from 150 million the previous year). Public approval of BBC news and current affairs in particular dipped slightly during the summer and autumn of 2003 but recovered by the end of the year.

BBC News 24 outperformed Sky News in both weekly and monthly reach in multichannel homes in January 2004, the first full month since changes at the channel were put into effect. For the first time in two years, BBC News 24 moved ahead of Sky News in being perceived as the channel best for news. In March 2004, for the first time, half the British population aged over 15 used the internet. Some 45% of them, more than 10 million, visited bbc.co.uk. BBC interactive services grew strongly over the year and now reach 5.3 million people monthly - half the digital population.
