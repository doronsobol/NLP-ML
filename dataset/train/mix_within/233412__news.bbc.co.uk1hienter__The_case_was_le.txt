Married to the TV presenter for 21 years, Mrs Barrymore wrote an autobiography about their turbulent relationship three years ago.  They were still married when Mr Barrymore revealed he was gay, leading to their split. She had been his agent.  She was diagnosed six weeks ago but kept her condition secret.  Mrs Barrymore died at St John and St Elizabeth Hospital in St John's Wood, north London.  Mr Clifford said she had chosen to "go home" rather than have chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment.  "The doctors told her that treatment might have given her a bit more time but she didn't want all that," he said.  "She wanted to make the most of what time she had left."  She had slipped into a coma and died with sister Carol by her side, he added.  Mr Clifford paid tribute to Mrs Barrymore as "a lovely lady, so bright and bubbly".  "I suppose she will be best remembered as playing an important part in building the career of a man who was one of the biggest stars in British television."
