An asthmatic teenager who collapsed on the summit of Snowdon was rescued with the help of the mountain railway.  A coastguard rescue helicopter was unable to reach the girl, 17, who had been sheltering from 70mph gusts of wind with a group of youngsters on a Duke of Edinburgh expedition.  A special train was put on to take mountain rescue teams to the mist-covered peak.  The girl was carried to the train and brought down to a waiting ambulance.  She was then taken to hospital at Bangor.
