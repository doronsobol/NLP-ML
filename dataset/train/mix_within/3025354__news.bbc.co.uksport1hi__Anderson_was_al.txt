Former Everton youth Gary Dempsey gave Aberdeen an early lead from close range, but James Beattie glanced home a header from a Mikel Arteta cross.  Jamie Smith restored the lead after a strong run and cross by Chris Clark.  But Tim Cahill turned in an Anichebe cross and the provider turned match winner from a Phil Neville delivery.
