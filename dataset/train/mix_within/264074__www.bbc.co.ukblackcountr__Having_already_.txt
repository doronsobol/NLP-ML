When speedway began in the town, in a meeting organised by the Wolverhampton Dirt Track Motor Cycle Club. The big attraction was a match race between Sprouts Elder, legendary Californian, and Ivor Creek, holder of the Glasgow Golden Gauntlet. Unfortunately, Elder’s machine failed to start and the crowd were left disappointed.  Following the success of the events held at the stadium, another club was formed - the Monmore Motor Cycle Sports Club, which included Arthur ‘Westy’ Westwood and Tommy Deadman.  Another meeting was organised by the Birmingham Motor Cycle Club and Harry Taft won both the junior and senior events in front of a comparatively small attendance.  It was announced that Monmore Green was being taken over by the British Dirt Track Racing Association Ltd. They set about widening the track to accommodate five rider races and reported that they had an incredible 3,000 riders on their books and were looking to get some of the better ones to Wolverhampton.  Wolves attained mid-table positions in 1970 and 1971, the latter year notable for Olsen’s world championship success in Gothenberg, Sweden. Ole Olsen had become Wolverhampton’s first world speedway champion.  In 1996, Monmore Green was being redeveloped to accommodate a new greyhound circuit.  Mikael Karlsson followed up his success over 2000 and 2002 with another impressive performance to take the 2002 Ladbroke Olympique Title.
