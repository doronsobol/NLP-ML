A 5,000-seater stand was opened in 2004, but now the county board feels it is time for additional covered and seated accommodation.  Work has already started on the second phase of a Â£5m redevelopment scheme.  Included in the plans is a new control tower, press box, the installation of a lift in the stand, and new changing and referee's room.  The ground has already staged a number of floodlit games, including a senior club championship semi-final this season.  Last week it was revealed that a state-of-the-art training complex is also to be developed in Omagh.  The purpose-built complex will be used by all county teams, including hurling, camogie and ladies football.  It will feature playing pitches, changing facilities, an astro-turf floodlit facility, indoor hurling alley, gymnasium and other modern training facilities.
