The BBC had originally planned to hold a John Peel Day annually, but Radio 1 has not held any official commemoration of the event since 2007, though gigs still take place around the country to mark the anniversary.

The John Peel Centre for Creative Arts is to reopen following the completion of the final stage of building work.  A mezzanine floor, two bars, toilets and wooden dancefloor are among the Â£1m additions at the Stowmarket venue, which closed in July.  It will reopen on Friday night and hold a series of "test events" before a grand opening in the spring.  Andy Stringer, chairman of the centre, said: "It looks radically different to six months ago."  Radio 1 DJ Peel lived in the Stowmarket area for many years before his death in 2004.  The 220 capacity venue, which used to be the Corn Exchange, will be run by a community interest company.
