With six minutes left, Ricketts, on loan from Tottenham, picked the ball up in midfield and cut inside Ibrahima Sonko before rolling the ball home.  Reading had taken an early lead through Nicky Forster's delightful lobbed volley, but Leon Clarke's deflected header brought Wolves level.  The result leaves Reading seventh, behind West Ham on goal difference.  Reading manager Steve Coppell (on Wolves boss Glenn Hoddle):  "If they keep hold of Glenn I see them as favourites to go up next season "At 1-1 I wanted to win the game because one point would not materially affect what happens next week. "But they always had a spare man in midfield. They had a lot of possession and their passing was good."  Wolves manager Glenn Hoddle:  "We controlled the midfield and they never really got to grips with Seyi George Olofinjana. "I told them in the team talk that Reading would have to change the way they played to cope with him and they did that late in the game." Reading: Hahnemann, Murty, Keown, Sonko, Hughes, Little (Ferdinand 74), Sidwell, Harper, Brooker (Ingimarsson 62), Forster, Kitson.   Subs Not Used: Convey, Newman, Young.
