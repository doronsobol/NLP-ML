Cheryl Gillan is one of the Conservative Party's most senior female MPs.  She is, politically, on the moderate right, and is a mild Eurosceptic - soon after her election in 1992, she was one of the signatories to the 'Fresh Start' campaign.  She served under John Major as junior minister in the Department for Education and Employment.  A former marketing executive, with a particular interest in small business, she joined the front bench Trade and Industry team after the 1997 election.  She became a foreign affairs and international development spokesman, a role in which she proved a trenchant and successful critic of the government.  She is enthusiastically partisan in debate.  Having served as a Whip from 2001 to 2003, she currently works on the shadow home, constitutional and legal affairs team.
