Meanwhile PC Trevor Lock, the policeman who had been on guard at the embassy, was on his own with "Salim", the leader of the gunmen. When an SAS man appeared at the window PC Lock rugby-tackled the gunman, stopping him from shooting at the SAS man. The SAS then burst into the room and shot Salim. PC Lock was hailed a hero and later awarded the George Cross for his actions.
