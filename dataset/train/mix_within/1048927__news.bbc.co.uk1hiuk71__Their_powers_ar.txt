In a Commons debate, Wrexham's Labour MP Ian Lucas said Wales' Red Dragon should be added to the union jack's red, white and blue pattern.  He said the union jack currently only represented the other three UK nations.  But Stewart Jackson, Conservative MP for Peterborough, said the plan was "eccentric" and would be unpopular.  "I do not believe it would add to the unity of the country," he said.  However, Culture Minister Margaret Hodge conceded that Mr Lucas had raised a valid point for debate.  She said the government is "keen" to make the Union Jack "a positive symbol of Britishness reflecting the diversity of our country today and encouraging people to take pride in our flag".  And the minister acknowledged that a number of people across Britain were unhappy about flying the Union Jack as they felt it does not "truly represent the United Kingdom".  However, she said redesigning the flag had not been part of a consultation currently being carried out.  Their comments come after a Commons debate in which Mr Lucas said: "I believe that the Union Flag should change now to reflect the four nations of the United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales."  He argued that the UK "did not exist in a constitutional state of grace".  "Changing an iconic image such as the union flag may appear to be more difficult to achieve than 200 years ago, but nonetheless I believe the change is right," he said.  "Let the debate begin, let the rest of the world know that the iconic symbol of the United Kingdom may change and that the reason that it will change is that we have a new constitutional settlement that affords Wales its true place in the Union."
