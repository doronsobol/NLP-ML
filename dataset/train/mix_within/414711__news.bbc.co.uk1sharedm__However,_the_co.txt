Political profile:  Helen Clark (formerly Helen Brinton) attracted the attention of the press soon after her first election in 1997, for her conspicuous and enthusiastic support of the Labour leadership.  Her name became something of a byword for unquestioning New Labour loyalty.  This caricature was unfair; while she is no tub thumping rebel, she is sparkier than many of her backbench colleagues and joined the Commons select committee rebellion in July 2001.  Mrs Clark is a busy backbencher, who campaigns effectively on a narrow range of subjects, rather than taking a scattergun approach.  She is interested in wildlife issues, and has tabled many early day motions and two 10 minute rule bills on green themes.  This background gave her additional authority when she was one of the leading Labour voices in opposition to violent animal rights protests.
