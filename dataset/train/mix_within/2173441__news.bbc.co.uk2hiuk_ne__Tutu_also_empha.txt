Tutu also emphasised that when South Africa had used those methods the country had been condemned; however when powerful countries such as Britain and the United States of America had invoked such power, the world was silent and in that silence accepted their methods even though the left charged that they violated essential human rights.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu has attacked Tony Blair for his "mind-boggling" support for the US over a possible war in Iraq.  The Nobel Peace winner said he was shocked and saddened America was being "aided and abetted" by Britain.  His criticism came as preparations for a possible war continued with President George W Bush building-up US forces in the Gulf, currently totalling around 60,000 troops.  The British Government is expected to announce later this week that it is planning to deploy troops to the region, reportedly numbering 27,000.  Mr Blair came home from his family holiday in Egypt on Saturday to be met with the fresh controversy at home from the leading anti-apartheid campaigner.  Archbishop Tutu - the former head of the South African Council of Churches - demanded on LWT's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: "When does compassion, when does morality, when does caring come in?  "I just hope that one day that people will realise that peace is a far better path to follow.  "Many, many of us are deeply saddened to see a great country such as the United States aided and abetted extraordinarily by Britain."  It was "mind-boggling" the prime minister was showing such support, the Archbishop went on.  "I have a great deal of time for your prime minister but I'm shocked to see a powerful country use its power frequently, unilaterally.  "The United States says you do this to the world, if you don't do it we will do it - that's sad."  Archbishop Tutu asked why Iraq was being singled out when Europe, India and Pakistan also had weapons of mass destruction.
