Lord Ahmed of Rotherham was driving his Jaguar on Christmas Day when he was in collision with a car and its driver.  Martyn Gombar, 28, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, had been in another crash that had left his red Audi A4 facing the wrong way in the third lane.  He was hit by the Jaguar as he tried to return to his car, police said. Lord Ahmed said: "It was horrendous."  Lord Ahmed, 50, who recently flew to Sudan to negotiate the release of the British teacher Gillian Gibbons, sustained facial injuries.  His wife and elderly mother, who were also in the car, suffered minor injuries.  He told the BBC that he was still in shock.  "The police are still investigating so there is not a great deal I can say," he said.  "It was horrendous. I haven't got over the fact that there has been a fatality.  "I'm in shock and still recovering from my injuries. My wife and mother are in shock too."  Police said Mr Gombar had left his car in the third lane after it struck the central reservation.  He went to the hard shoulder but was hit as he tried to get back to his vehicle, near junction 35 of the southbound carriageway.  Two other cars were also involved in the incident, which happened at about 1820 GMT.  The carriageway was closed for several hours after the crash.  Police have urged witnesses to the crash to come forward.  Lord Ahmed was born in Pakistan but brought up in the UK. He attended Thomas Rotherham College and then studied public administration at the University of Sheffield.  He joined the Labour Party when he was 18 and served as a local councillor in the 1990s. He founded the British Muslim Councillors' Forum in 1992 and was appointed to the House of Lords in 1998.
