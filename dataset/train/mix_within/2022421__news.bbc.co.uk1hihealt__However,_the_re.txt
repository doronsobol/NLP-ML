Miss Rayner, the chairman of the Patient's Association and a former nurse, will chair an advisory panel to improve standards at Holloway Prison.  The panel will also include prominent lawyer Helena Kennedy and leading medics from outside the prison system.  David Lancaster, the prison governor, is keen to improve the care and treatment of the 500 women prisoners held at the north London jail.  Some 75% of Holloway's inmates arrive with either psychiatric or drug-related problems, or both, putting intense pressure on detoxification facilities and psychiatric care.  Mr Boateng warned that failing to address health issues stored up problems for the women on release, and was a missed opportunity to tackle re-offending.  A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said the aim of the advisory board was to pool the expertise and experiences of people from outside and within the prison system in a bid to bring standards of healthcare up to the same level as those available in the community.
