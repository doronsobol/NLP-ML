To promote the charity, band members Sarah, Nicola, Kimberley and Cheryl met fans at a children's hospital in Leeds.  Last year Shane Richie's cover of the Wham classic, I'm Your Man, reached number two in the charts and helped the charity raise Â£30 million.  I'll Stand By You is released on 15 November with all proceeds going to Children In Need.  The girls said they were "over the moon" when asked to do the charity song.  Nicola explained: "Hopefully if our single does well it's a lot of money going to the charity."
