The BBC presenter has been filmed attacking the Perodua Kelisa with a sledgehammer before blowing it up.  But minister Abdul Raman Suliman defended the nation's car industry, saying Mr Clarkson was like a football commentator who cannot play football.  Perodua had not received a single complaint from UK owners, he told MPs.  He added that the comments were made merely to boost sales of the Top Gear magazine.  Mr Clarkson has voiced his frustrations with the small three-cylinder model in both magazine articles and on film.  In one article, he said its name was like a disease and suggested it was built in jungles by people who wear leaves for shoes.  And in a DVD car review, he described it as "unimaginative junk, with no soul, no flair and no passion".  He then smashed it, hung it from a crane with a one-tonne weight attached, before blowing it up.  Perodua is Malaysia's second national carmaker and began producing small compact models in 1995.
