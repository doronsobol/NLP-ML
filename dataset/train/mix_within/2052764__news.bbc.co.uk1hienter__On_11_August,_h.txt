Doherty had been imprisoned for breaking into a bandmate's home out of "spite" after being dumped from the band.  On Monday his sentence was reduced at a hearing at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court in London.  The cut will mean the singer will be released from prison "almost immediately".  Doherty had pleaded guilty to burglary at an earlier hearing at Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court in London.  According to NME.com, Richard Locke, defending, told the appeal hearing the burglary was an "impulsive and unplanned" act motivated by "feelings of anger and betrayal by his closest friend".  He told the court: "He is a 24-year-old who had suddenly come into a bit of fame and a bit of money and clearly has a drug habit.  Reducing the sentence, Judge Derek Inman said: "We feel that a custodial sentence was justified in this case but sufficient credit was not given for his timely plea of guilty which it should have been.  "We have reduced his sentence to two months which will allow for his almost immediate release."  Doherty, who was not present at the 20-minute hearing, has already served three weeks and should only have to spend a further week in jail once time off for good behaviour is taken into consideration, NME said.  Doherty had broken into a flat owned by fellow singer Carl Barat in July after being asked to leave the group because of his heroin and crack addiction.  He had kicked down the door and stolen items including an antique guitar, laptop computer, video recorder, CD player, mouth organ and books.  A Libertines spokesman said it was hoped that Doherty and Barat would "get together" following Doherty's release.
