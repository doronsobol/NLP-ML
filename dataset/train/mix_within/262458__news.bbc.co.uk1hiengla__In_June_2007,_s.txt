Police have made contact with model Katie Price over claims that she was raped by an unnamed celebrity.  The claims that she was attacked by a "famous celebrity" first surfaced in her column in a national magazine.  Ms Price, 31, who models under the name Jordan, said she had no plans to make a formal complaint and would "absolutely never" name the celebrity.  Surrey Police have arranged for a full interview with the glamour girl about the allegations in the near future.  Ms Price split from her pop singer husband Peter Andre in May.  The pair became an item while contestants on ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.  They were married for three-and-half years and have two children together, Junior and Princess Ti√°amii.  Ms Price has an eight-year-old son, Harvey, from her previous relationship with footballer Dwight Yorke.
