Lee Steele sealed the win when he completed a much-deserved hat-trick in the final minute of regulation time.  Two goals by Gareth McAuley and one from Simon Yeo put Lincoln 3-2 ahead, as Orient found the net courtesy of Steele and then Michael Johnson.  And Steele found the target in the 78th minute after a Matt Lockwood cross before sinking his third at the death.
