The doctor who helped a 62-year-old French woman to conceive, making her one of the world's oldest mothers, has defended his decision.  Dr Vicken Sahakian from California told the BBC that he had no moral qualms about helping the retired teacher with fertility treatment that has shocked France.  Dr Sahakian, who works at the Pacific Fertility Center in Los Angeles, argued in an interview with the BBC World Service's World Today programme that the outcry over Jeanine's age reflected male chauvinistic society. "On a daily basis we see couples where the man is in his 50s or 60s and a woman is in her 30s, and we certainly don't make a big deal of it, but when it's the opposite it's headline news," he said. But the doctor said he would not have proceeded had he known the couple were related. He admitted that he makes limited checks on the personal lives of his patients. The infants have reportedly been born into a fraught family atmosphere.  They are heirs to an inheritance worth $2m but to parents who reportedly hate each other. "The members of this family ferociously hate each other and use the police to settle their fights. The situation is very worrying and is caused by family misunderstandings about future inheritance," reads a 1993 police report. Jeanine eventually forced Robert to leave the house and live in a caravan where he shot himself through the chin in a fit of depression. Their 80-year-old mother, who they live with in Frejus in the south of France, has dismissed the suggestion that the children will would become pawns in an inheritance battle. "I think Jeanine and Robert have been reconciled and their children will be loved," she said.
