Paris St Germain have confirmed they are prepared to close down a stand reserved for visiting supporters after a Marseille fan was seriously injured at the end of a first division clash last week.  Geoffroy Dilly, 18, was taken to hospital after being hit by a seat thrown from another stand at the Parc des Princes stadium.  Hospital sources said his condition was serious but stable.  PSG won last Friday's match 2-0 to stay top of the table.  "We are currently studying various solutions and if need be, we will empty the stand," said PSG security chief Eric Glain.  "The offenders probably acted when a steward was not looking or they took advantage of the rush at the end of the match," he said.  PSG officials said they wanted to solve the problem before next week's matches against Rosenborg in the Champions League and Bordeaux in the French league.  Relatively few away fans travel to matches in France, but the often bitter rivalry between the Parisians and Marseille - seen as representatives of the southern half of the country - occasionally spills over into violent scenes.
