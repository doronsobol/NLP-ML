So, here's the deal, every three months we have these things called...  They are the nationally accepted tables of radio listening figures.  The day, always a Thursday, is a day to dread. But not for us today, phew relief, my goodness, thank the heavens, we did alright.  We went up quarter on quarter, December notoriously bad for us so double whoopee, and year on year we went up by over a quarter of a million. We are now properly into the five million + mark.  Thanks to the team, the best, and on behalf of them thanks to you for being there to be counted. Thanks also to my big boss for believing in me and the good Lord upstairs for giving me a second, third, fourth and however many more chances to get this thing called life right.  Funnily enough we have made a few changes, sublte - hopefully unnoticeable and it seems they've paid off. Dare we trim the sails even tighter to the wind ? I think we have to.  So beers all round today, well maybe not before the show, and tonight we announce the drivetime doggie that will be "it" 2008.  Oh, yes and don't forget ALL REQUEST FRIDAY record number one suggestions considered from this moment forth.  Have a great one you lot and thanks again.  P.S. We're doing caffeine tights tonight, the inventor swears they work !
