Mr Herrmann said he would work with the rest of the editorial team "to deliver the best of the BBC's journalism across all our platforms from web to interactive TV, keeping the focus on editorial excellence and creativity.

The department was founded in 1997 when it launched the BBC News website, which attracts more than 700 million page impressions a month and reaches more than a quarter of UK internet users.  It has an average of nearly four million global readers per day.
