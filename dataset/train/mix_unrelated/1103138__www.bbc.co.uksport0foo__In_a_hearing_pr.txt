Guy Bates has joined Linfield on a two-year deal after being released from his contract by Glenavon.  The striker, who emigrated to Australia last year, had requested the Lurgan Blues release him from a contract which does not expire until 31 May 2016.  Although Glenavon rejected the request initially, the club has now reached an agreement with Linfield for the player.  "He's a proven, quality striker who knows this league very well," said Linfield manager Warren Feeney.  Bates, 29, has been playing with Adamstown Rosebud in the Northern New South Wales Premier League since quitting Glenavon last August.  He played a major part in the revival of the Lurgan club's fortunes, culminating in an Irish Cup final success in May 2014.  Securing his services is a huge boost for Warren Feeney, who has promised more signings ahead of the new season.  "He [Bates] is a player who I have admired for some time so we're delighted to have been able to sign him," said the Blues manager.  "He's got great pedigree and I'm sure he's going to be a real asset for us.  "I'm really looking forward to working with him when he joins up with the squad, and he is delighted to be signing for us.  "The hard work to secure other possible signings will continue, as we build up to the start of the new season."
