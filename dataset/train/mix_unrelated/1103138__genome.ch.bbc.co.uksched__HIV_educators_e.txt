This site contains the BBC listings information which the BBC printed in Radio Times between 1923 and 2009. You can search the site for BBC programmes, people, dates and Radio Times editions.  We hope it helps you find information about that long forgotten BBC programme, research a particular person or browse your own involvement with the BBC.  Through the listings, you will also be able to use the Genome search function to find thousands of radio and TV programmesÂ that are already available to view or listen to on the BBC website, and programmes to purchase.  There are more than 5 million programme listings in Genome. This is a historical record of the planned output and the BBC services of any given time. It should be viewed in this context and with the understanding that it reflects the attitudes and standards of its time - not those of today.
