Buddhists can worship both at home or at a temple. It is not considered essential to go to a temple to worship with others.  Buddhists will often set aside a room or a part of a room as a shrine. There will be a statue of Buddha, candles, and an incense burner.  Buddhist temples come in many shapes. Perhaps the best known are the pagodas of China and Japan.  Another typical Buddhist building is the Stupa, which is a stone structure built over what are thought to be relics of the Buddha, or over copies of the Buddha's teachings.  Buddhist temples are designed to symbolise the five elements:  All Buddhist temples contain an image or a statue of Buddha.  There are as many forms of Buddhist worship as there are schools of Buddhism - and there are many of those.  Worship in Mahayana tradition takes the form of devotion to Buddha and to Bodhisattvas.  Worshippers may sit on the floor barefoot facing an image of Buddha and chanting. They will listen to monks chanting from religious texts, perhaps accompanied by instruments, and take part in prayers.
