A number of fixture postponements meant that they had to play 17 league fixtures in a minute, and Le Tissier announced that he would be able to play in four or five games, also saying he was unable to play Saturday games due to his job as a television pundit on Soccer Saturday.

Former England and Southampton playmaker Matt Le Tissier hopes to make his Guernsey debut on Sunday.  The 44-year-old was born on the island but has not played professionally since 2002.  He will to help the club, who have to play 17 games in a month due to postponements.  "The fixture pile-up has been a bit mad and they need all the bodies they can get," Le Tissier told BBC Radio 5 live's Weekend Breakfast show.  "The first squad I'll be available for is next Sunday's game [14 April] at home to Raynes Park Vale.  "Saturday games are out but there are probably four or five games I'll be available for."  Le Tissier is an honorary president of the club and his brother Mark is a director.  The television pundit, who made 541 appearances for Southampton and won eight caps for England, was registered by Guernsey earlier this season.  Le Tissier made his Saints debut in 1986, spending 16 years at the club and scoring 162 goals.  In 1989-90 he was voted PFA Young Player of the Year and other career achievements include scoring 30 goals in the 1994-95 season and winning Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award the following year for his drifting 40-yard lob against Blackburn Rovers.  Le Tissier added: "I was born and grew up on Guernsey.  "Hopefully my hamstring won't snap! I've been doing a bit of training for the Guernsey half-marathon in June and have been pounding the streets of Southampton.  "While I'm in semi-reasonable shape, I told them that if they need me, I'll be there."
