Revathi Massosai, the name by which she wants to be known, says she was forced to eat beef despite being a Hindu.  Miss Massosai was seized by the Islamic authorities in January when she went to court to ask that she be registered as a Hindu rather than a Muslim.  The case is one of a number that have raised religious tensions in Malaysia.  Miss Massosai was born to Muslim converts and given a Muslim name, but she was raised as a Hindu by her grandmother and has always practised that faith.  However, under Malaysia's Islamic law, having Muslim parents makes one a Muslim and, as such, one is not allowed to change one's faith or marry a non-Muslim.  But Miss Massosai married a Hindu man in 2004 and the couple have a young daughter.  When in January she asked a court to officially designate her a Hindu she was detained and taken to an Islamic rehabilitation centre.  Her detention was twice extended to six months, during which time she says religious officials tried to make her pray as a Muslim and wear a headscarf.  However, the claim that will particularly shock Hindus is that the camp authorities tried to force her to eat beef.  A lawyer representing the Malacca state Islamic department responsible for Miss Revathi's arrest, rejected her allegations and said officials believe that she can still be persuaded to embrace Islam.  She is adamant that she will remain a Hindu. In the meantime, Miss Revathi and her daughter have been placed in the custody of her Muslim parents.
