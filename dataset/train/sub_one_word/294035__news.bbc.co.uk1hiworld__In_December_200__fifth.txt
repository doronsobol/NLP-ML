Police said the grenade was thrown at the mayor, Badruddin Ahmed Karman, just after he inaugurated a local badminton tournament on Friday evening.  Mr Kamran, a senior figure in the opposition Awami League, was taken to a safe place.  He later told the BBC that it was an attempt to kill him.  Hundreds of protestors took to the streets, changing anti-government slogans.  In August 2004 Mr Kamran escaped a similar attack which killed one local opposition politician.  In May 2004, the British High Commissioner to Dhaka, Anwar Chowdhury was also the target of a grenade attack in Sylhet town.  He was injured, but later recovered.
