Their opponents, Port Adelaide, playing in their first ever grand final, were too good on the century and recorded a 40-point win.

Brisbane, favourites after winning the previous three titles, were leading by a single point at half-time.  But Port Adelaide, only admitted to the AFL in 1997, stormed back to win 17.11 (113) 10.13 (73).  Gavin Wanganeen kicked four goals while Norm Smith medallist Byron Pickett and Toby Thurstans scored three apiece.  "They were as hard as hell to beat and it's as sweet as hell to beat them," said Port Adelaide coach Mark Williams.  The game was one of the most physical finals and featured several confrontations including a long punch-up between Lions full forward Alastair Lynch and Darryl Wakelin in the first quarter.  It was the first Grand Final appearance for Port Adelaide, who had crashed out in the play-offs in the last three seasons.  It was also the first time two teams from outside Melbourne, the birthplace of Australian rules football, had contested the final.  Brisbane were going for their fourth successive title, attempting to match Collingwood's feat from 1927-30.
