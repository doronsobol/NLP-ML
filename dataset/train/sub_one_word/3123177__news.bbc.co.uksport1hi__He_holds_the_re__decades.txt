He holds the record for longest time spent as Test captain, he took charge of his first Test on 13 December 1913 and his last on 16 August 1924, a period of 10 years and 251 decades.

The Test Match Special statistician will be busy answering your questions throughout the English winter.  Fill in the form on the right-hand side of the page to stump the Bearded Wonder.  At the Adelaide Test, Laxman and Dravid put on 303, making it their second 300-run partnership. How many other pairs have done this and what is the highest number of 300-run partnerships between the same pair?  No pair of batsmen has shared more than two triple-century partnerships in Test cricket.  In addition to Rahul Dravid and Vangipurappu Laxman, two other pairs have twice registered 300-run stands at that level:  Don Bradman and Bill Ponsford for Australia (388 at Leeds and 451 at The Oval against England in 1934)    Herschelle Gibbs and Graeme Smith for South Africa (368 v Pakistan at Cape Town in 2002-03 and 338 v England at Birmingham in 2003).  How many people have played just one Test for England?  Martin Saggers, who made his debut against Bangladesh at Chittagong last October, brought the tally to 87.  In September 2001 Robert Lawrie asked me to select my team from that long list of one-Test wonders (see Ask Bearders number 11).  Muralitharan's 56 overs in the second innings of the Kandy Test contained 28 maidens. Is this the highest number of six-ball maidens bowled by one bowler in a Test innings and if not, what is?  No. Alf Valentine holds the record with 49 maidens in the Trent Bridge Test of 1950 when, in second innings, the Jamaican slow left-arm spinner took three for 140 from an input of 92 overs.  That remained the most overs in a Test innings until his pal Sonny Ramadhin twirled down 98 at Edgbaston seven years later.  In the previous Test of that 1950 rubber, when West Indies gained their famous victory at Lord's, Valentine returned figures of 45-28-48-4 and 71-47-79-3 and that match tally of 75 maidens also remains a Test record.  Has there been ever an instance in Test cricket of a team scoring 400-plus runs in an innings without any of its batsmen scoring a 50?  No there hasn't. The highest total without a fifty is 302 by South Africa against New Zealand in very cold weather on an extremely slow pitch at Wellington in February 1964. Although nine batsmen - and extras - exceeded 20, the top score was only 44.  Has anyone ever been run out in both innings of the same Test?  Yes. The only England player to suffer this fate was John Jameson, the Warwickshire opener, in the Third Test against India at The Oval in 1971. He did manage to score 82 and 16 though.  In fact Jameson was run out in three of his first four Test innings having suffered this fate in the second innings of the previous Test (at Old Trafford) on his debut.  Was Paul Collingwood's five catches in the match a record for a non-wicket-keeping fielder on Test debut?  No. Yajurvindra Singh held five in an innings and six in the match on his debut for India against England at Bangalore in 1976-77. No other debutant has exceeded Collingwood's five though.  Is there any recorded instance of both batsmen being run-out off the same delivery?  No, because the ball becomes dead as soon as the first batsman is run out.  Superficially it did happen in a limited-overs international between England and West Indies at Scarborough on 26 August 1976.  Michael Holding's return from long-leg deflected off the nearer set of stumps and ricocheted to break the far wicket with Graham Barlow and Alan Knott (on his lone appearance as England's captain) both stranded in the middle of the pitch.  Umpires Bill Alley and Arthur Fagg were so dumbfounded that they rejected the appeal and both batsmen survived!  Who has been captain of a Test Side for the longest period? And who holds the record for each Test playing country? Do the war years count?  The record is held by Herbie Taylor who led South Africa in 18 Tests between December 1913 and August 1924, a period of 10 years 251 days which included the First World War.  The record without the benefit of a wartime hiatus is 9 years 146 days by John Reid who captained New Zealand in 34 Tests between February 1956 and July 1965.  Just 33 days behind Reid sits Allan Border who skippered Australia in a world record 93 Tests between December 1984 and March 1994.  Records for the other seven teams are:  England - Walter Hammond (19 Tests; 8yr 242d - including war years)   West Indies - Garfield Sobers (39; 7y 55d)  India - Mohd Azharuddin (37; 6y 159d)  Pakistan - Abdul Hafeez Kardar (23; 5y 167d)   Sri Lanka - Duleep Mendis (18; 4y 0d)   Zimbabwe - Alistair Campbell (19; 3y 52d)   Bangladesh - Naimur Rahman (7; 1y 10d).  How many Test cricketers were born in Scotland? I ask as I have just read that Australia's Archie Jackson was born in Rutherglen.  The grand total is eleven. England: Mike Denness (Bellshill), Gavin Hamilton (Broxburn), Alex Kennedy (Edinburgh), David Larter (Inverness), Gregor MacGregor (Edinburgh), Ian Peebles (Aberdeen), Eric Russell (Dumbarton), Peter Such (Helensburgh). Australia: Archie Jackson (Rutherglen). South Africa: Thomas Campbell (Edinburgh). New Zealand: Gordon Rowe (Glasgow).  Two other notable England cricketers, Francis MacKinnon and Douglas Jardine, had Scottish parents but were born in London (Kensington) and Bombay (Malabar Hill) respectively.  Ricky Ponting recently scored 242 in a loss to India. What is the highest individual Test score made a batsman on the losing side?  Ponting's 242 is now the highest score by a batsman on the losing side. It surpassed Nathan Astle's 222 against England at Christchurch in March 2002.  Inzamam-ul-Haq has the dubious honour of getting run out 36 times in his career. Who holds the record for the most run-outs?  That is his tally in limited-overs internationals - 36 run outs in 282 innings to the end of 2003. The LOI record is 38 run outs (in 280 innings) held by his fellow Pakistani, Wasim Akram.  Amazingly, Inzi has been run out only twice in 150 innings in his 91 Test matches to date. The Test record is 12 by Allan Border (265 innings in 156 Tests), with a brace of West Indies captains, Garfield Sobers and Carl Hooper, in second place with ten.  Re. AB #64 (M R of Canada). Didn't Graham Gooch make a duck in each of his first three Test innings?  No, he did not.  Gooch began his 118-match career with appearances in the first two Tests of the 1975 Ashes series, following his pair at Edgbaston with scores of 6 and 31 at Lord's. Three years (26 Tests) were to pass before he was recalled.
