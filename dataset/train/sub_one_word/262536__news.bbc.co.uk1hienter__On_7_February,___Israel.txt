Former reality TV star Jade Goody has undergone emergency surgery to remove a tumour on her bowel, her spokesman has confirmed.  Max Clifford said the 27-year-old star had been in "quite a lot of pain" so doctors decided to perform the four hour operation.  He said they had managed to remove the tumour without damaging the bowel and she was resting in a London hospital.  "As you would imagine she's very very sore and tender," he said.  "She has tubes in her neck and up her nose to try to cure the pain," Mr Clifford said.  "She had been experiencing an awful lot of discomfort - and was blocked up and her tummy was swelling up," he said.  Mr Clifford said doctors were hoping she would be well enough to start a new course of chemotherapy next week, but said it "depends on how she responds to the operation she had yesterday".  Goody, best known for appearing in the 2002 series of Channel 4 show Big Brother, was diagnosed with cervical cancer illness in August.  Earlier this week the mother-of-two revealed the cancer had spread to her bowel, liver and groin.  She told The Sun: "I am devastated, frightened and angry. I don't want to die, I have so much to live for."
