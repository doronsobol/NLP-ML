A security guard found guilty of murdering the ex-wife of former South African President, FW de Klerk, has been sentenced to life in prison.  Marike de Klerk, 64, was found stabbed and strangled in her luxury Cape Town flat in December 2001.  The Cape High Court sentenced Luyanda Mboniswa, 22, to one life term for murder and a second life term for robbery with aggravating circumstances. He also received three years for housebreaking.  "You showed absolutely no remorse whatsoever throughout this trial. There's no doubt that the communities out there are looking to the court for protection against crimes of violence that you have committed," said Judge John Hlophe.  Mboniswa was acquitted on a rape charge. He showed no emotion in court and was led away by police.  The judge said the defence had not provided any evidence to contradict the prosecution's case that Luayanda Mboniswa, had robbed and killed her.  He worked at the sea front block of flats at the time.  However, Mboniswa was acquitted on charges of rape.  Mrs de Klerk battled depression in her later years after the former president left her for his mistress.  They divorced in 1998 after 39 years of marriage.  She was the country's first lady from 1989 to 1994, the period during which Mr de Klerk released the African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela from prison and dismantled the country's apartheid system.  Mrs de Klerk was at one point in charge of the then ruling National Party's women's wing.  President Thabo Mbeki described her as a "strong, charming and dignified woman".  Her body was found after she failed to keep a hairdresser's appointment.  Mboniswa was arrested two days later.
