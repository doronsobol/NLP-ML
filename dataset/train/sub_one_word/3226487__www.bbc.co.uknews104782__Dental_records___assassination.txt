Police investigating the disappearance and murder of Bath woman Melanie Hall have arrested a 38-year-old man.  He is being held at a police station and will be interviewed in connection with the 25-year-old's murder and the disposal of her body.  Miss Hall went missing in June 1996 and her remains were found near the M5 last October.  The man, from Bath, was arrested after going voluntarily to Manvers Street police station.  Miss Hall vanished 14 years ago while on a night out with friends at Cadillacs nightclub in Walcot Street, Bath.  The psychology graduate from Bradford-on-Avon worked as a clerical officer in the orthopaedic department at the Royal United Hospital in Bath.  Her remains were found by a workman clearing the side of the M5 in South Gloucestershire on 5 October 2009.  Det Supt Mike Courtiour said: "This is obviously a significant development after 14 years but I must stress that our investigation is still very much ongoing.  "Melanie's parents, Pat and Steve Hall, are always kept informed and are aware that we have made an arrest."
