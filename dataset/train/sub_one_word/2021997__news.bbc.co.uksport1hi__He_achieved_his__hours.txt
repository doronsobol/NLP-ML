The 51-year-old finished his circumnavigation in 57 days, 13 hours 34 minutes and six seconds to beat MacArthur's mark set in 2005.  He set off from Brest on 23 November and crossed the finish line on Sunday.  MacArthur congratulated Joyon but has not ruled out trying to reclaim the record one day saying "records are set to be broken".  But the 31-year-old confirmed any attempt would not be launched in the next year because she was already committed to other projects.  She was in Brest, in France, welcoming Joyon home in a special ceremony to mark the record-breaking feat.  "His boat is bigger so it's normal that he goes quicker but he deserves the record and I'm happy for him," said MacArthur.  "What he's done so far is simply incredible, and I've been following his journey everyday, talking to him on a couple of occasions."  He sailed his 97ft trimaran IDEC II around the southern reaches of the globe and had to grapple with gale-force winds and a damaged mast, which almost ended his attempt.  MacArthur added: "I know it's been hard for him, that he's had to suffer."  MacArthur beat Joyon's previous record and won hearts around the world when she circled the globe three years ago in 71 days, 14:18:33 on her boat Castorama.  That was just one day faster than Joyon's previous time in IDEC I.  This time Joyon looped under South Africa and Australia and Chile before heading back for the French shore.  He broke several intermediary records along the way. He crossed the Indian Ocean in nine days, 12 hours and he crossed the Pacific in just 10 days, 14 hours.  Joyon was elated at his triumph but admitted he had not dared to believe until he was safely ashore.  "Right up to the end, I was worried about damage.  "In the night I almost hit a container ship and I had a fishing boat across from me. It has been a constant struggle."
