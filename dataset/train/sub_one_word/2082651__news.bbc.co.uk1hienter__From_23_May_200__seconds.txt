Jonathan Ross's Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2 is to be pre-recorded 24 hours in advance, the BBC has revealed.  Recording the show ahead of broadcast, "enables us to ensure the programme is watertight", said a spokeswoman.  Ross, she continued, was "absolutely on board" with the decision, as it meant "he gets his weekends back".  She said the move was unrelated to one incident, but was "a measured decision taking everything that has happened in the last few months".  She did not confirm whether listeners will be told the show had been pre-recorded when it is aired.  Ross, 48, was suspended for three months last year for his part in the Radio 2 row over lewd messages he and comedian Russell Brand left on actor Andrew Sachs' answer machine.  He resumed his Radio 2 show in January, but some of his more recent remarks have come under scrutiny.  The newspapers pounced on a remark he made in his comeback show about an elderly Spanish neighbour of co-presenter Andy Davies.  More recently, he was criticised for implying that boys who are fans of US pop star Hannah Montana are gay and should be put up for adoption.  Ross denied there was any homophobic intent behind the remark, but admitted "you need to be sensitive to avoid upsetting folk".  Radio 2's spokeswoman said that anything that did not meet its compliance guidelines would be edited out prior to broadcast.  She also denied newspaper reports that Ross was "fuming" over the decision, pointing out that his Friday night chat show on BBC One was also pre-recorded.  This week's edition of Ross's radio show was recorded on Wednesday because of the half-term break.
