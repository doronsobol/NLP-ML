     Mr Boyce was one of 37 people in Wales to receive honours from the Prince of Wales at an investiture ceremony in Cardiff Castle.    After being presented with his MBE, Boyce, 55, said: "He (the Prince) said he was surprised it took them so long."      The folk-singing comedian, from Glynneath, south Wales, said the Prince was a committed fan who had sent him a telegram congratulating him when he was notified about the MBE.      Boyce, who rose to prominence in the early 1970s, added: "I am genuinely thrilled. It is something I never expected. I was really nervous."      Prince Charles went on to speak with champion hurdler Colin Jackson of his concern about the problem of drugs in the sport.    He advised Jackson he had to be wary of drugs when he invested him with an OBE.      Jackson, 33, said: "He was really concerned about the issues which are happening in athletics with drugs."      The 110 metre hurdler said the Prince also wished him well for this year's Sydney Olympics because he "might be too old" for the next one.      The runner, who received his award for services to athletics, said he had agreed with the Prince that he would not be young enough next time round.      Earlier, the Prince was greeted at Cardiff Castle by Shenkin, the Royal Regiment of Wales' ceremonial goat, when he arrived for the investiture.      After leaving the ceremony - during which 37 people were presented with honours - the Prince was due to open officially Cardiff Heliport and the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, in Llantrisant.      Entertainer Max Boyce MBE said Prince Charles was "surprised" that he had not received his honour sooner.Mr Boyce was one of 37 people in Wales to receive honours from the Prince of Wales at an investiture ceremony in Cardiff Castle.
