In May 2015, after Mallon stated he would not contest a fifth term, Dave Budd (Labour) was voted in, narrowly defeating Andy Preston (independent).

Labour's Dave Budd has been named Middlesbrough's new elected mayor after winning by just 256 votes.  With no candidate securing more than 50% of the vote in the first round, he secured the post following a count of second preferences against Independent candidate Andy Preston.  Also running were Conservative Lloyd Cole-Nolan and independents Len Junier, Michael Carr and Dave Roberts.  A total of 51,876 people voted - a turnout of 53% - but BBC Tees political reporter David Rhodes said there was a scene of "chaos and farce" as "counting was weighed down by a huge number of spoiled ballots".  The result was finally announced at about 21:00 BST.  Ray Mallon previously held the post but stood down after serving three terms. The position was introduced in 2002.  Voters opted to keep the elected mayor system in a referendum in September 2013. Labour councillors campaigned for the role to be abolished.
