As the procession marched down the high street towards the Bullring, thousands caught a glimpse of the attraction that has become an annual tradition in Birmingham since 1996.

Numerous local bands took to the stage throughout the afternoon, including BBC WM Introducing favourites Scarlet Harlots, The Heathers, The Destroyers and Birmingham-Irish band The Father Teds.
