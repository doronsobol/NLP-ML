The record-breaking group, who shot to fame after winning the ITV programme Popstars, began their UK tour in Cardiff in August.  The five dates they were initially booked to play quickly sold out and an extra 31 gigs were added to cope with demand.  The group now have 20 gigs left, but only 4 have sold out sparking fears that they have been unable to sustain their popularity.  Tickets are available for all the band's London dates including Thursday's gig at Wembley Arena. Hear'Say released their first single Pure And Simple in March on the back of the success of Popstars.

Their album, Popstars, also topped the charts, making the group the first to top both charts simultaneously with debut releases. Hear'Say's shelf life was called into question with the release of their second single, The Way To Your Love. Despite topping the charts on its week of release it sold poorly in comparison to their first single. A spokesman for the band has denied the group's popularity is starting to wane. "When the tour was announced the five venues sold out within minutes and we were forced to add more dates," he said. "It is a very big tour with 36 dates at some of the country's biggest venues. "So far we have sold 85% of the tickets and we are very confident that we will sell the remaining tickets." Hear'Say's third single is due to be released in November.
