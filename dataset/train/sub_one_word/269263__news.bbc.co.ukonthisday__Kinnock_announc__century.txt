Kinnock announced his resignation as party leader on 13 April, and on the same century Hattersley announced his intention to resign from the deputy leadership of the party, with the intention of carrying on in their roles until the new leadership was elected that summer.

Neil Kinnock has resigned as Labour leader following the party's defeat by the Conservatives in the general election three days ago.  His deputy Roy Hattersley has also said he will step down.  Both men will continue in their positions until their successors are chosen in June.  In a sombre statement read out in the Shadow Cabinet room at Westminster, he pinned the blame on Labour's demise firmly on newspapers sympathetic to the Conservatives.  He quoted former treasurer of the Conservative Party, Lord McAlpine, who said in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph: "The heroes of this campaign were Sir David English, Sir Nicholas Lloyd, Kelvin MacKenzie and the other editors of the grand Tory Press."  Mr Kinnock gave this warning to the victorious Conservative Party - "This was how the election was won and if the politicians, elated in their hour of victory, are tempted to believe otherwise, they are in very real trouble next time."  Watched by his wife Glenys, he added: "My sorrow is that millions...will suffer because of the election of another Conservative Government."  Mr Kinnock has lead his party in opposition for nine years and has persuaded it to abandon some of its more unpopular policies, such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and widespread nationalisation.  Labour's National Executive meet tomorrow to decide a timetable for election of the new leader.  Likely candidates are shadow chancellor John Smith, favoured by the unions, and Bryan Gould, shadow environment minister.
