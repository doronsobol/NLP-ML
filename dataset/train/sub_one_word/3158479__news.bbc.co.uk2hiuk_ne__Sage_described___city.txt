Angie Sage, from Milverton, now looks set to become JK Rowling's successor in Hollywood with her stories about Septimus Heap.  Three of Ms Sage's books have risen to the top of the American book charts.  Magyk, Flyte and Physik feature a magician who can turn anything to chocolate and writes spells on toast.  Warner Bros is believed to have considered hundreds of books in its search to find a movie successor to Harry Potter.  The deal will be worth millions of pounds for Ms Sage if the films prove a hit. JK Rowling is believed to have generated Â£545m from her franchise.  "I have had the character of Septimus in my head for a long time, and the world he lived in too," she said.  "I knew what would happen to Septimus in the end, but I did not know exactly how he would get there, or who he would meet on the way.  "That's the exciting thing about writing the world that he lives in - so many creatures and people just appear and make things happen," said Ms Sage.
