This try resulted in his father Mark Williams winning £25,000 from a £50 bet placed almost 10 years previously that he'd one week become Wales' leading try scorer.

Welsh Rugby Union and assembly government chiefs are examining how to mark Wales' "wonderful victory".  No details have been released, but the last time Wales won the Grand Slam in 2005 Cardiff's Millennium Stadium hosted a bank holiday party.  Meanwhile, Shane Williams's record-breaking try in Saturday's game won his father a reported £25,000 bet.  In 2005 some 20,000 fans were joined by the team and the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall in the stadium.  There had been earlier discussion of an open-tour bus tour in 2005, but in the event the party was the preferred option.  It remains unclear what will happen this year, but Plaid Cymru leader and Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said that, personally, he would like to see a bus parade.  The Welsh Assembly Government said: "There have been discussions on this and it has already been agreed that the Welsh Rugby Union and Welsh Assembly Government would look at ways of marking this wonderful victory."  The Welsh team have been inundated with messages of congratulations since Saturday's victory, including one from the Prince of Wales, who sent a text to WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis within hours of the win.  It said: "What magnificent news that you have received the Grand Slam in such spectacular style!  "I fear that mere congratulations seem rather inadequate on such a triumphant occasion, but I am thrilled that your single-minded dedication and ceaseless labours have produced such a stunning Welsh victory.  "You have no idea how proud I am of you at the end of such a red letter day."  Prince William, who presented the trophy in his role as vice royal patron of the WRU, visited the Wales changing room after the game to deliver his own congratulations.  On Sunday, a message of congratulations from Prime Minister Gordon Brown was delivered to the WRU.  Otherwise, Shane Williams's father had an extra reason to celebrate as his son capped a wonderful tournament with the second-half try that edged Wales ahead before a second Grand Slam in four years.  Before his son ever pulled on a Welsh shirt, Mike Williams is said to have laid £50 at 500-1 that he would one day become his country's top try-scorer.  Williams's touchdown on Saturday against France was his 41st, putting him ahead of Gareth Thomas's 40.  The Ospreys star won his first cap in 1999 at the age of 21, by which time his father had already taken a punt on his son's future prowess.  Williams got off to a flier in his first full game for Wales with a try against Italy in the 2000 Six Nations.  He now has 56 caps, and his record-breaking try was his first against France and allowed him to complete the set, meaning he has now scored against every major rugby-playing nation.  The 31-year-old winger, who comes from the Amman Valley, said: "It feels fantastic to break the Welsh try-scoring record and do so well in this championship."
