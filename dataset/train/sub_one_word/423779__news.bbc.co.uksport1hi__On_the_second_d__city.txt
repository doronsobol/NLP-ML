In the months leading up to the World Championship, Steve Davis had won three of the season's five preceding ranking titles and both the Benson and Hedges Masters and Irish Masters.  This golden run of form remained in place for the duration of the championship and Davis steamrollered the field. In the last 16, he thrashed Mike Hallett 13-1 before accounting for Tony Drago, who had beaten Alex Higgins and Dennis Taylor, 13-4.  Terry Griffiths, enjoying a renaissance nine years after his Crucible title, came through the other half, beating Jimmy White 16-11 in the semi-finals.  Davis, who had beaten Cliff Thorburn 16-8 in the other semi-final, took a 5-2 first session lead but Griffiths levelled at 8-8 going into the final day.  Davis began the third session in edgy fashion, missing a few simple pots, but Griffiths' failure to take advantage turned the match and Davis would made two centuries, 118 and 123, in winning ten of the day's 13 frames for his 18-11 success.  The match of the championship had come in the last 16 when White beat Stephen Hendry 13-12. There were 26 breaks of more than 40 in the 25 frames and the average frame time was just 12 minutes.
