Work has begun to pump water out of Aberdeen's Rubislaw Quarry for the first time since it stopped operating several decades ago.  The 450ft deep hole is almost full of rainwater accumulated over more than 40 years, leading to fears it could cause flooding.  Owners Hugh Black and Sandy Whyte have installed pumping equipment. The work began on a day of heavy rain.  The aim is to develop a heritage centre at the site.  The quarry, which closed in 1971, is credited with giving Aberdeen its Granite City name.
