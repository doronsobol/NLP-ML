So to resolve the situation, Scott and the team are touring the UK this week to find her a date.  The search for the lucky man began on Monday with a trip back to Southampton, Scott's hometown. The X-Factor style auditions involved 20 hopeful men, who were been picked from the thousands of entries.  They had to show off their special talents to try and win her heart in front of a crack team of judges including Scott and Laura's dad. "Secretly, there are quite a few people that I'm looking forward to finding out what they look like" said Laura.  "There are some really cool people coming along tonight, I think somebody's even going to be playing the guitar, I think that might impress my dad as well!" The bus continues its five date tour this week to Cardiff (28th), Nottingham (29th), Newcastle (30th) and Glasgow (31st). The winner will then be decided by listeners’ votes on Friday 7th April before the happy couple head off to Paris for the weekend.
