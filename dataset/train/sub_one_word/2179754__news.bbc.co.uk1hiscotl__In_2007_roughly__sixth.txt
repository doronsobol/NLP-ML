More than 60,000 people are employed in the industry, with 20,000 in Glasgow.  Recruitment firm Office Angels said 160 companies now have call centres in the Glasgow area.  The report said firms recognise the "calming and trust-building" effect of the Glaswegian accent and described the industry as evolving rapidly.  Fraser McLeod, operations manager of Office Angels, said: "The right individual can progress quickly, with lucrative rewards.  "Glasgow is the UK's call centre hub and for people looking for a new challenge, opportunities abound."
