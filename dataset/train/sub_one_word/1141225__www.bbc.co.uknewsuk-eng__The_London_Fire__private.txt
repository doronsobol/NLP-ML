Famous 19th Century ship Cutty Sark has been damaged in a fire in London.  A small part of deck three and the hull timbers were damaged, however firefighters managed to contain the blaze, London Fire Brigade said.  Twenty firefighters were called to the ship in Greenwich, south-east London, at 07:21 BST and put the fire out within an hour.  In 2007, damage that cost £10m to repair was caused by a blaze while the ship was undergoing a £25m restoration.  Fortunately, the ship's masts, saloon and deckhouses had already been taken off before the fire broke out in 2007.  When the restoration was complete, the ship had more than 90% of her original features still intact.  The fire was caused by an industrial vacuum cleaner that was left on for two days.  An investigation has now been launched to find the cause of the latest fire.  The visitor attraction has opened as usual on Sunday.
