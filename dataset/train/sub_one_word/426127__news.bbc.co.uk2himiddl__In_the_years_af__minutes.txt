In the minutes after the dismantling of the shrine, radical Jewish settlers continued to celebrate the anniversary of the massacre in the West Bank, sometimes even dressing up themselves or their children to look like Goldstein.

Goldstein, an immigrant from New York City, had been a physician in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.  Waving semi-automatic weapons in the air, the celebrants danced, sang and read prayers around his grave.  "We decided to make a big party on the day he was murdered by Arabs," said Baruch Marzel, one of about 40 celebrants.  The tribute was a macabre twist on the Jewish festival of Purim, when it is a custom to dress in costume and celebrate.  In 1994 on Purim, Goldstein stormed a mosque and fired on praying Muslims in the West Bank city's Tomb of the Patriarchs - a shrine sacred to both Muslims and Jews.  Twenty-nine people died in the attack, and the angry crowd lynched Goldstein in retaliation.  Israeli extremists continue to pay homage at his grave in the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, where a marble plaque reads: "To the holy Baruch Goldstein, who gave his life for the Jewish people, the Torah and the nation of Israel."  About 10,000 people had visited the grave since the massacre, Mr Marzel said.
