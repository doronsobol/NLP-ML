Film producer Peter Rogers, who was responsible for the Carry On Series of movies, has died at the age of 95.  Rogers was credited with the 31 films from the iconic franchise, made between 1958 and 1992.  He worked at Pinewood film studios for 50 years, and attended an event at the famous facility to mark Carry On's golden anniversary last year.  Rogers' hope to produce another film in the long-running series, Carry On London, has yet to be realised.  Attempts to get the project off the ground are now likely to be abandoned following Rogers' death.  Along with director Gerald Thomas, Rogers produced one of the most well-recognised film franchises in UK cinema history.  He began his career as a newspaper reporter, beginning his career in the movie industry writing scripts for religious information films.  Rogers also produced a series of Carry On highlights programmes which ran on television for several years.  Before the Carry On films, the producer worked on a series of films including 1953's The Dog and the Diamonds, which picked up an award at the Venice Film Festival.  His life's work was rewarded at the British Comedy Awards in 1990 and by the London Critics' Circle six years later.  Rogers was married to another British film producer, Betty Box, who died in 1999.
