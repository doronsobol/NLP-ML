The army corporal from south Dublin wasn't thought to have much of a chance against world champion Juan Hernandez Sierra of Cuba.  But, after the bout was tied 8-8 after the second round, Carruth won the third 5-2 and with it the title.  Wayne McCullough could have been the Irish hero but he had failed to win the bantamweight final earlier that day.  McCullough was considered to have had the best chance of becoming Ireland's first Olympic champion since Ron Delany won the 1500m in 1956.  But he had started slowly against another Cuban, Joel Casamayor Johnson, trailed 10-2 going into the third round and, despite a vigorous late onslaught, lost 14-8.  Carruth, whose father Austin was his trainer, recalled that he had then said in his dressing room: "Dad, I'm going to win this fight.  "I'm going to bring the gold medal back with me to Dublin. Ronnie DelanyÂ¿s time is up."  Indeed his victory in the Joventut Pavilion saw him instantly promoted to sergeant back at home.  And, on the day of his return to Ireland, local pubs dropped the price of beer to that of 1956.  Thanks to Michael Carruth a pint of Guinness could be bought for four pence on that day in 1992!
