From here the Lake Axe rises up from a deep sump where progressive depth records for cave diving in the British Isles have been set: firstly by Farr (45&#160;m or 148&#160;ft) in 1977, then Rob Parker (68&#160;m or 223&#160;ft) in 1985, and finally by John Volanthen and Rick Stanton (76&#160;m or 249&#160;ft) in 2004.

Rick Stanton and John Volanthen went more than a mile into caverns, clearing gravel and rock in their way before reaching a depth of 76m.  The previous record of 71m was set in Speedwell Cavern in Derbyshire in 2003.  "We wear a computer which shows us the depth," said Mr Stanton. "We both have records that show our depth was 76 metres."  "If you compare us to mountain climbers - even an unclimbed peak - they know everything about it," he added.  "Even when they went to the moon, they had a map and knew everything that would surround them.  "Yet here we have no idea what's going to happen around the next bend."  Mr Stanton, a 43-year-old firefighter from Coventry, was involved in the rescue of 13 British cavers in Mexico earlier this year.  Together with Mr Volanthen, a 33-year-old Bristol-based engineer, the pair developed a "rebreather" unit to allow them to stay underwater for longer periods.
