Leicester have fined Robbie Savage two weeks' wages after he used the toilet in the referee's dressing room before Saturday's game with Aston Villa.  Poll reported Savage to the Football Association for breaking a rule which says a player cannot enter the referee's dressing room without permission.  "Robbie Savage has been fined the maximum permissible two weeks' wages," said a Leicester spokesman.  "Leicester City were made aware of the incident on Saturday evening by match referee Graham Poll and then conducted their own investigation.  "The club has spoken with Robbie Savage and communicated the decision to him."  Savage could also face an improper conduct charge from the Football Association.  A spokesman said: "We can confirm we are examining the referee's report concerning an incident involving Robbie Savage."
