The record, Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh, soared to the top of the charts after knocking the charity record, Perfect Day, featuring a host of guest artists, from the number one spot.  With the success of the Teletubbies single, bookmakers William Hill have shortened the odds on them topping the Christmas charts to 6-4 on.  The Spice Girls are trailing in second place at 11-8 with their new single Too Much.  Perfect Day, which has so far raised Â£1m for children's charities, is third favourite at 6-1.  The antics of Tinky Winky, Po, Dipsy and La La attract two million viewers in Britain every morning, making Teletubbies the most popular programme in the country at that time.  The Teletubbies have proved to be a success across the world, the BBC having sold the programme to many countries.
