The terms were not disclosed in court papers filed in Los Angeles.  In December 2005, Deborah Brando alleged Mr Brando beat and threatened to kill her. He later claimed she broke into his home and attacked him.  Mr Brando spent five years in jail in the 1990s for the manslaughter of his half-sister Cheyenne's boyfriend.  Last August, Mr Brando counter-sued with the allegation that his then-wife had broken into his home in December 2004 and "savagely" beaten him.  She was upset because he wanted to annul their marriage 10 weeks after their wedding, his legal action said.  In January 2005, Mr Brando pleaded no contest to two charges of spousal abuse.  He was given three years probation and ordered to undergo drug and alcohol rehabilitation as well as a domestic abuse prevention programme.
