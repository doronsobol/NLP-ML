Two people have been killed in a plane crash close to Oxford Airport.  The light aircraft came down and burst into flames in a snow-covered field just after 1400 GMT, near the A4095 Grove Road in Bladon.  Eyewitness said flames from the wreckage rose 30ft (9m) into the air. A cordon has been set up while investigations into the crash start.  The plane was not based at the airport but had been grounded since Christmas due to recent poor weather conditions.  Eyewitness Michael McPeak, who lives on Orchardfield Road in Bladon, was in his garden when he saw the accident happen.  "I heard the aircraft on full throttle," he said.  "It looked like he was trying to pull the aircraft up but unfortunately crashed into the ground.  "Within five seconds it burst into flames which were 30 feet high."  Maffi Moushkila was a couple of miles away in the village of Thrupp when he heard the plane crash.  He said: "I heard the engine stop and about two seconds afterwards there was a bang.  "About 20 seconds later there was another bang. A few minutes later the airport alarm went off."  South Central Ambulance Service said the plane came down in a field about half a mile from Heath Lane at Bladon.  The fire service sent four crews to the scene, but they had difficulty in putting the fire out because the remote location made it difficult to run hoses to the crash site.  Crews extinguished the blaze at just after 1540 GMT after using 4x4 vehicles to access the field.  The Air Accident Investigation Branch, based in Farnborough, Hampshire, has sent a team to investigate.
