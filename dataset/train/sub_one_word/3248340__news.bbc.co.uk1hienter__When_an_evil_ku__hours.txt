Dreamworks is in talks to make a sequel to animated film Kung Fu Panda, the movie studio has confirmed.  Chief executive Jeffrey Katzenberg told Reuters an announcement could be made within two months.  "We've started conversations about it, and I think in the next 30 or 60 days, we'll be able to talk completely about that," he said.  Set in China, Kung Fu Panda follows the journey of a clumsy panda in his efforts to become a kung fu warrior.  Voiced by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Lucy Liu, the film took $560m (Â£299m) in global ticket sales and became Dreamworks' most successful movie, surpassing the Shrek franchise.  Mr Katzenberg was speaking at a screening of clips from Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, a sequel to the original 2005 movie featuring the voices of Ben Stiller and Chris Rock.  He added the company would also produce and release at least one, and possibly two, more Madagascar movies after the sequel, which is due out in November in the US and December in the UK.
