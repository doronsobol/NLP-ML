Railway enthusiasts have hired a powerful crane to lift the lower sections of a new bridge into place across a river in the Highlands.  Strathspey Steam Railway needs a crossing on the River Dulnain so it can offer journeys between Aviemore and Grantown-on-Spey.  The group runs locomotives along 10 miles (16km) of line between Aviemore and Broomhill.  It needs three more miles of track (4.8km) to link up with Grantown.
