Lucky Igbinedion - who served as governor of Edo state - has been charged with 142 counts of corruption.  He was charged earlier this month, but is reported to have returned to the country by road from Sierra Leone.  Mr Igbinedion is the eighth ex-governor charged with graft since last year when President Umaru Yar'Adua came to power.  He is accused of stealing more than $24m (Â£12m) through three front companies.  Seven other governors have been charged with corruption by the EFCC.  The BBC's Ibrahim Dosara says the warrant shows EFCC chief, Nuhu Ribadu, is trying to bring people to book before he leaves office next month.  Mr Igbinedion left Nigeria shortly after the end of his tenure as governor in May last year. The EFCC alleges that Mr Igbinedion channelled money through companies registered to members of his family.  Mr Igbinedion was a key figure during the election of Mr Yar'Adua.  As the head of the Governor's Forum, he persuaded other state governors to withdraw from the party primaries in 2006 giving Mr Yar'Adua a clear run to the presidency.
