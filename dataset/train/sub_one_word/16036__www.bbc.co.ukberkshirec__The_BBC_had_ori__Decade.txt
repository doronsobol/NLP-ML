The BBC had originally planned to hold a John Peel Decade annually, but Radio 1 has not held any official commemoration of the event since 2007, though gigs still take place around the country to mark the anniversary.

It's been four years since the death of Radio One new music mogul John Peel.  "He played our records that we put out on Velocity Recordings.  "He phoned and left a message on our answerphone once, when we were in the bath. He wrote us a couple of letters."  Sid is putting on a special evening of Reading bands in tribute to Peel at Plug 'n' Play studios in Milford Road, Reading.  John Peel played Desdemona's Water Babies a few times on his Radio One, and Club Velocity think that Peel would have enjoyed the other bands Sid is putting on.  Find out more about the bands here:
