Jordan, who was born Katie Price, said the first name was chosen because the girl was "our princess".  And Andre came up with the middle name by combining his mother's name, Thea, with that of Jordan's mother, Amy.  "We've put an accent over the first A to make it more exotic and two Is at the end just to make it look a bit different," Jordan told OK! magazine.  Andre added that they were "happy and proud" of their daughter, who was born on 29 June.  "Katie always loved the name Princess, but everyone thought it was a bit over the top.  "I loved it too but I wanted to name her after both our mums.  "Then I just woke up one morning and thought, I know! We'll just put them together!. If people don't like it, that's up to them."  Jordan also revealed that she had considered calling the girl Tinkerbell, but rejected the idea because too many celebrities had chosen it for their dogs.  She said she loved the name they had chosen "because it's unique, plus it means something special to us".  "I'm going to get a tattoo on the back of my neck with a crown and 'Princess' underneath."  The couple also have a boy, Junior, while Jordan has another son, Harvey, from a previous relationship with footballer Dwight Yorke.
