Crews were called to Trent Mill Industrial Estate in Shaw, Oldham, in the early hours.  Smoke caused visibility problems for motorists in the area, police said, but no homes were evacuated and roads remained open.  Fire crews are expected to stay at the factory for several days to make sure the building is safe.  Residents were told to keep doors and windows closed as much as possible to protect them from the smoke.
