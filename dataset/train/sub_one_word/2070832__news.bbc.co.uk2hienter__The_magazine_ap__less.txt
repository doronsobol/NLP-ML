Ms Diaz, 34, sued publishers American Media Incorporated over pictures and a story that appeared on the National Enquirer website in May 2005.  It claimed the photos showed Ms Diaz cheating on her then boyfriend Justin Timberlake with a TV producer.  The magazine has apologised to Ms Diaz and accepted the story was untrue.  Ms Diaz, star of films such as Charlie's Angels, started dating singer Mr Timberlake in 2003.  The couple announced last month that they had split up.  The story and pictures appeared on the website along with the headline Cameron Caught Cheating! in May 2005.  Her solicitor, Simon Smith, told Mr Justice Eady, at London's High Court, that the article reported that she had a "smooching session" with married MTV producer Shane Nickerson.  It went on to allege that she was facing a "grilling" from Mr Timberlake over the photographs.  Mr Smith added that after Ms Diaz complained, the article and photographs were removed from the website and the hard copy edition distributed in the UK did not contain either.  Sam Howard, the magazine's solicitor, said that it entirely accepted that the allegations were without foundation, saying that they never should have been published.  He added that the magazine now accepted that the photos did not show Ms Diaz and Mr Nickerson kissing, or in a passionate clinch, and that it involved no more than her giving a friend a goodbye hug.  The magazine apologised for the distress caused to Ms Diaz, Mr Timberlake, Mr Nickerson and his wife.
