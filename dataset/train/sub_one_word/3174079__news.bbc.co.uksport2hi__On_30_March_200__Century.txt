The award comes as a rich reward for the cup exploits of the Perth side after knocking two SPL sides out of the Scottish Cup in February.  The Saints thumped Falkirk 3-0 in the fourth round before beating Motherwell 2-1 in the quarter finals.  The Perth men currently sit second in the league, four points behind front runners Gretna.
