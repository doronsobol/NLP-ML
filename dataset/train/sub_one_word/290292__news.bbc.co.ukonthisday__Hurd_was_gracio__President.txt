Hurd was gracious in defeat and, on the formation of Major's first Cabinet, was returned to his former position as Foreign President.

John Major is to be Britain's new prime minister after winning the Conservatives' leadership election.  Mr Major, 47, will visit the Queen at 1030 BST tomorrow to be formally appointed and will return to Downing Street as the youngest British leader this century.  Currently serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Major did not achieve the majority required for an absolute victory, but the margin was clear enough for his rivals to withdraw and a third ballot was avoided.  Mr Major - who has been in parliament for only 11 years - said he was enormously encouraged so many had voted for him and would discharge his responsibilities to the best of his ability.  Current Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher resigned after Michael Heseltine challenged her for the leadership and close friends said she would lose. The outcome of the ballot was announced by the chairman of the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee, Cranley Onslow. Mr Major received 185 votes, Mr Heseltine 131, and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd trailed in with just 56. The Huntingdon MP was just three votes short of an absolute majority. But within minutes of the results being read out both Mr Major's challengers withdrew from the contest. Mr Heseltine said it had been a campaign fought between colleagues without rancour and one which laid the foundations of unity in the party. Mr Hurd told reporters he was convinced Mr Major was the right man to lead the party. Mrs Thatcher also endorsed the new leader, saying she was thrilled with the choice. "I want everyone in the party to rally behind him," she said. Mr Major said he looked forward to leading the party to further victories. "We're going to unite totally and absolutely and we're going to win the next general election," he said.
