A nine-year-old boy from the United States has become the youngest person to reach the summit of Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Americas.  Tyler Armstrong climbed the mountain, in the Argentine Andes, with his father and Tibetan sherpa Lhawang Dhondup.  "Any kid can really do this, all they have to do is try. And set their mind to the goal," he said after reaching the peak, on Christmas Eve.  More than 100 people have died attempting to conquer Aconcagua, which rises 6,962m (22,841ft) above sea level.  "You can really see the world's atmosphere up there. All the clouds are under you, and it's really cold," said Tyler.  His father, Kevin Armstrong, told AP that his son trained twice a day for six months before attempting to climb Aconcagua.  "Most people think we as parents are pushing Tyler to do this, when it's completely the opposite," he said.  Because of his age, Tyler needed special authorisation from a judge in Argentina to make the attempt.  His father said the judge took into account the fact that the team were raising money for muscular dystrophy research.  The youngest person to have conquered the mountain before him was 10-year-old Matthew Moniz, also from the United States, in 2008.
