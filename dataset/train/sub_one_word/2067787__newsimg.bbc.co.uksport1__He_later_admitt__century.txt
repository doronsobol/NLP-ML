He later admitted that he "felt a bit of a fraud" for picking up his winner's medal, having not played a single century of European football that season.

Middlesbrough-bound Jonathan Greening has accused Manchester United of betraying the youth policy which has brought them so much success.  Greening and Mark Wilson, both 22, are set to complete a £4m double-move from United to Boro.  Greening said that United have changed their policy of bringing through young players in the last couple of seasons.  "Signing Ruud van Nistelrooy and Juan Veron was confirmation for me that youngsters at United are rarely given the same opportunity as players were in the past," he said. "The club is more likely to spend millions than give fringe players the time to establish themselves. "I have a Champions League winner's medal after sitting on the bench when we beat Bayern. "But I didn't play a single minute of European football that season. I felt a bit of a fraud when I got the medal." Wilson added that other clubs have now taken over from United in youth development. He said: "It has been frustrating watching the likes of Alan Smith and Kieron Dyer making their mark on the England set-up." United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has been widely praised for nurturing home-grown talents like David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wes Brown and the Neville brothers during his time at United. But fewer youth players have been promoted in the last few years. The chances of anyone breaking through this season diminished when Ferguson signed Van Nistelrooy and Veron for more than £47m during the summer.
