Morton have appointed John McCormack as their new manager in place of the sacked Dave McPherson.  McCormack moves immediately from Queen's Park, whose committee will meet on Wednesday night to decide on finding a new manager.  McCormack confirmed to BBC Scotland on Tuesday that he was interested in the job with Queens' Third Division rivals.  McCormack had previously been linked with a move to Morton but decided against joining the Greenock outfit due to the club's precarious financial position.  He joined Queen's Park in 1998 but welcomes a return to a club with more resources now that they are under a new regime.  McCormack said: "I am sad at leaving Queen's because I met a lot of nice people and had good times there.  "However, this is a challenge and I'm looking forward to that.  "It's back to full-time football and to working with players full time. I am leaving a lot of talented players at Queen's, but there are also talented players at Morton.  And he added: "They are a club whose ambition is very high and I am ambitious too."  Queen's Park remain the only amateur outfit in Scottish senior football and the move to Morton would be viewed as a return to a club with a greater chance of success.  He was sacked by Dundee in 1998 despite having led them to promotion to the Scottish Premier League.  McCormack was also in charge as Queen's Park were promoted as champions from the Second Division in 2000 only to come straight back down after losing many of his best players to professional clubs.  Former Hearts, Rangers and Scotland defender Dave McPherson was sacked on Thursday.  Veteran defender Derek Collins acted as caretaker as Morton's promotion challenge suffered another blow with 2-1 defeat away to Albion Rovers on Saturday.
