Two men have been jailed for life after being convicted of murdering a pub landlord outside his bar.  Swinder Singh Batth, 47, was hit by a "poorly-aimed" bullet fired at someone else in Bilston, West Midlands, on 28 July 2009, an eight-week trial heard.  Jasbir Singh Takhar, 23, of Birmingham New Road, Coseley, was jailed for 29 years at Birmingham Crown Court.  Sukwinder Singh Sanghera, 24, of Albion Road, West Bromwich, was jailed for 28 years.  Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said Mr Batth died minutes after being shot in the chest at Gavin's Sports Bar.  Mr Hotten told the jury the fatal shooting happened after a Seat Alhambra and a Renault Clio pulled up outside the bar.  The QC added it was very unlikely Mr Batth was the intended target of the bullet, which had been fired with a "considered and deliberate desire for revenge" after an earlier dispute near the premises.  The jury took four-and-a-half hours to unanimously convict Takhar and Sanghera of murdering Mr Batth.  Four men and a woman were found guilty of conspiracy to commit violent disorder.  Amardeep Singh Narwal, 25, of Sedgley Grove, Handsworth Wood, was given a three-and-a-half year sentence for witness intimidation.  A 17-year-old youth was given 195 days detention for the same offence.
