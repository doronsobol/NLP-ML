In the Latvian capital, Riga, the remaining part of the roof over a collapsed supermarket has caved in while recovery teams were working inside.  The building collapsed on Thursday, killing at least 54 people, possibly because of the weight of soil and materials from a garden being built on the roof of the shop.  Latvian President Andris Berzins has called the disaster "a large scale murder of many defenceless people", and called for an investigation at "maximum speed".
