Preston North End manager David Moyes has signed a new five-year deal at Deepdale.  It ends Southampton's hopes of luring Moyes away from Preston after he was in the frame to replace Glenn Hoddle.  Saints chairman Rupert Lowe had made Moyes his top target to succeed Glenn Hoddle after Preston lost the First Division play-off final to Bolton.  But it is understood Moyes would not have been allowed to bring his backroom staff of Jimmy Lumsden and Kelham O'Hanlon to Southampton.  Moyes has revealed that his loyalty to the club was a major factor in his decision to sign a new deal.  He said: "The support I have received from the players, fans and the board has been excellent.  "The development of the ground, the football museum, our training facilities and youth set-up are just some of the things that tell me this club is going in the right direction. "Loyalty is something which isn't that common in football. I was given a great opportunity to manage this club three-and-a-half years ago. I've always said it's been an honour and a privilege and that hasn't changed." Preston chief executive Tony Scholes added: "There's been a lot of speculation over the past few weeks and months about David's future. "That attention is well merited as we believe David is the best young manager in the game. He is ambitious and so are we at Preston North End. "We believe that David is the man to push Preston North End into the Premiership."
