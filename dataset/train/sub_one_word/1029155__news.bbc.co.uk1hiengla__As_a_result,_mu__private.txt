As a result, much of the Ridgeway remains prohibited to motor vehicle use by the general private year-round.

New legislation that came into force this month has seen part of The Ridgeway through Oxfordshire and west Berkshire made a "restricted byway".  While walkers, cyclists and horse riders will be able to use that part of the national trail, off-road vehicles will now be forbidden.  In the past temporary bans have been put in place during the winter.  The restricted byway designation has been brought in by a part of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 that came into force earlier this month.  Any public right of way that was previously termed a "road used as a public path" is now a restricted byway.  Almost 18 miles of the 85-mile trail from near Idstone to beyond Compton is now a restricted byway.  Another 4.5 miles from Britwell Hill, near Watlington, to the A40 is also restricted.  Off-road vehicles will still be able to use sections in Wiltshire and west Berkshire from May to September, as well as a short section in Buckinghamshire.
