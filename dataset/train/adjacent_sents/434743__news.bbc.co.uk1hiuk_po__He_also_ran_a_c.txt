John Mann was first elected in 2001, but has a lot of national political experience under his belt, having served for several years at Labour's Millbank headquarters, where he was responsible for managing links between the party and the trade unions.  Prior to this, he worked as a political officer and head of research for the AEEU union.  He is regarded as in the vanguard of right-wing party modernisers.
