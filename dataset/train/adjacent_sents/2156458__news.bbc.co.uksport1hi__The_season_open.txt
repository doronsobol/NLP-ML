County champions Warwickshire were dealt a seven-wicket defeat by an MCC XI at Lord's as Andy Flower and Alastair Cook thrilled with the bat.  Warwickshire indulged in big hitting before declaring on 225-4, setting the hosts 296 to win in 62 overs.  It was a task well within MCC's grasp, with Flower (110 not out) and Cook (97) ensuring they won inside 54 overs.  The pair put on 196 runs for the third wicket after Heath Streak and Dougie Brown had reduced MCC to 54-2.  The Championship holders added 155 runs for the loss of one wicket in the morning session, with wicket-keeper Tony Frost the man to go, caught for 91 off Owais Shah.  Frost had put on 161 for the fourth wicket with Jonathan Trott, who was left unbeaten on 72 when skipper Nick Knight called his men in.  Victory seemed a tall order for the home side on a fourth-day pitch, and they looked in trouble when Streak had Matt Prior caught behind for 29 and Mike Powell (six) was trapped in front by Brown.  But it was all one-way traffic thereafter as Essex pair Flower and Cook set about demolishing the Bears' attack.  Cook, who hit 13 fours and a six, fell to a catch off Jonathan Trott and was unlucky not to score his seconds century of the match.  There were no such problems for Zimbabwean Flower, who secured his 37th first-class hundred before steering MCC home with Mark Pettini, another Essex batsman, unbeaten on 41 at the other end.  The Championship season gets under way on Wednesday, with Warwickshire hosting newly promoted Glamorgan at Edgbaston.
