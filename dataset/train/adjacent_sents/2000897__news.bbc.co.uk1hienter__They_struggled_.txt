The band, who burst into the UK charts in 1999 with their single Dancing in the Moonlight, made their announcement on their website on Tuesday.  They left a message on their news page, which said: "We have decided to call it a day with Toploader.  "We just wanted to say thank you so much for your support over the years.  "You have been the best fans and we will miss you all. Cheers, the band."  The band's spokespeople made no other statement.  The band, fronted by singer and keyboard player Joseph Washbourne, also featured Dan Hipgrave, the husband of TV presenter Gail Porter.  The band had a huge hit with their first album, Onka's Big Moka, which was released in 2000. It debuted at number five in the UK charts.  They released a second album, At the Magic Hotel, last year.  But it did not match the success of the first.  They struggled with a backlash from the UK music press and their most recent single, Time of My Life, could only make it into the Top 40.  The band did not say whether any of the members planned solo careers.  They were recently dropped by their record label, Sony S2.
