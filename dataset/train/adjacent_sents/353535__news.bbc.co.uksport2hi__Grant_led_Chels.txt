Ex-Israel coach Grant, 51, was appointed last week by Chelsea and holds a place on the club's board whom he will report to on a regular basis.  Mourinho said: "He's here to give some support to different areas in the club and for me that is not a problem.  "From my point of view, he must not interfere with the power I have in relation to my job."  Grant flew out with Mourinho and his squad to Los Angeles on Monday to join in with the club's pre-season preparations.  He will be responsible for liaison on, and co-ordination of, football matters across the various areas of Chelsea.  While Mourinho welcomed the arrival of the man who left his role as technical director at Portsmouth, he made it clear in what areas Grant's input would not be welcomed.  Mourinho said: "I think the club was very clear in the statement they put out.  "If you want to know more about his work ethic, you'll have to speak with him."  "He's here to give some support to different areas in the club and for me that is not a problem."
