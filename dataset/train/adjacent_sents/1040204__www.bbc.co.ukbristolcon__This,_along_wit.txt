This, along with changes to licensing laws and tightening health and safety requirements, led to a more commercial style of organisation, with a compulsory entrance fee and a strict security presence around the perimeter fence.

The big turnout for the two-day event has guaranteed its future for at least another year.  The 2001 festival made financial losses after crowds failed to attend at Hengrove Park.  Organisers were forced to move the event after foot-and-mouth closed off Ashton Court.  Festival-goers agreed something - perhaps the unique atmosphere - was missing from Hengrove and were delighted to have the event back at the North Somerset estate.      Kevin Rooney from the festival said: "We had a bit of a let down at Hengrove last year. People didn't come, so we lost a lot of money.  "Now we're back up here and everyone's come back. We're back home again and it's fantastic."  For the first time the festival had corporate sponsorship and charged a Â£3 entry fee - in the past all donations at the gates had been voluntary.  Organisers were also relying on the good weather to ensure a good turnout, and they were not disappointed.    Kosheen    Big name acts like Reef, Kosheen and Bad Manners attracted the usual diverse audience who also enjoyed sets by local bands.  A plethora of food outlets, stalls selling the usual festival wares (silly hats, herbal remedies, henna tattoos and even body piercings) occupied visitors between bands.  But most people were there to party - and that's exactly what they did...  The success of BCF 2002 has brought it back into the black and secured its survival for future generations of festival-goers.
