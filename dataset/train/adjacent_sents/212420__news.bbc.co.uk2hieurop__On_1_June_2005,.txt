On 1 June 2005, with four suspects already in custody in connection with the crime, the city government of Oslo offered a reward of 2 million Norwegian krone (roughly US$313,500 or €231,200) for information that could help locate the paintings.

Police say they are optimistic they will now recover the works.  The two paintings, jointly worth about $19m (£10.4m), were stolen in August in broad daylight at the Munch Museum in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.  The two paintings have not been recovered and are believed to be too well-known to be resold.  "The police are optimistic that the investigation will produce results and that the pictures will be brought back to the Munch Museum," Oslo police said in a statement.  The man arrested is said to be in his 30s. He will be questioned and jailed over the weekend, Reuters news agency reports.
