The Carisbrooke-Essex Partnership plans for the Park in Colchester, Essex, could help create 2,000 new jobs.  The Park is to be constructed on 43 acres of land adjoining the campus of the University of Essex on the eastern side of Colchester.  The plans will go before Colchester Borough Council some time after April next year.  The Park will include new high technology businesses which want to work closely with university researchers as well as a range of other companies which want high quality office space.  The development when complete will contain about 400,000 square feet of office space, about 200 private houses and flats, and space for more than 1,000 student study bedrooms to meet the future accommodation needs of the university.
