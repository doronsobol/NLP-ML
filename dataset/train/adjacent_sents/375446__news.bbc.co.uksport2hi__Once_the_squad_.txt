Back-row Inoke Afeaki, competing in his third World Cup, will captain Tonga in the tournament in France.  Tonga, who are in the same pool as England, open their World Cup campaign against the US on 12 September.  The squad was to have been announced a week ago but was delayed by problems within the Tongan rugby federation.  They had hoped to delay naming the squad until 20 August but the International Rugby Board insisted that all lists be submitted no later than the 14 August deadline.
