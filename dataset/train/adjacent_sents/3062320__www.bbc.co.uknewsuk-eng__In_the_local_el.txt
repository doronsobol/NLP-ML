Labour has taken total control of Manchester City Council in the local elections.  The party took all the seats contested in the poll, giving it all 96 on the council. A spokesman said this was thought to be an unprecedented feat.  Across Greater Manchester, there was no real change to the political landscape of the 10 councils.  In Stockport, the Liberal Democrats remain the largest group but there is still no one party in overall control.  The political make-up of Salford City Council remains the same, with 52 Labour seats and eight Conservative.  Elsewhere, although some individual wards have changed hands, the overall picture has not altered with Labour in charge of all but Trafford, which remains under the control of the Tories.
