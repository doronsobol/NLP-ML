Spain was a fierce opponent to allowing Gibraltar to become one of Uefa's associations and threatened to boycott any competition the colony competed in.  Only three of Uefa's 52 associations voted in favour of Gibraltar - the English Football Association, the FA of Wales and the Scottish FA.  Gibraltar has a population of 28,000, but has no professional footballers and only 563 registered players.  But Uefa did vote in for Montenegro to become its 53rd full member.  The Serbia & Montenegro Football Association was disbanded in June 2006 following the political split between the two republics.  The acceptance of Montenegro into Uefa had been widely expected and the proposal was carried unanimously.
