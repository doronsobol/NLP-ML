The game is most memorable for being the last played by the Manchester United side before the Munich air disaster the following day, when the team's aeroplane crashed in the West German city on the return journey.

On 5 February 1958, United lined up against Red Star Belgrade for their European Cup quarter-final holding a 2-1 lead from the first leg.  After only 90 seconds Dennis Viollet put United 1-0 up on the night and two more goals from Bobby Charlton made it 3-0 before half-time and the tie seemed over.  However, Red Star came back strongly and clawed their way back level, but with only three minutes left to play United held on and made it through to the European Cup semi-finals for the second successive year.  Sadly, the world would never see the 'Busby Babes' take the field together again.
