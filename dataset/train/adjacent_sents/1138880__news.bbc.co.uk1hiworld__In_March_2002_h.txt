Reports from China say that police used tear gas and water cannon to contain an outbreak of football hooliganism in the northern province of Shaanxi on Sunday.  The violence broke out after a match in the provincial capital, Xian, between two teams Shaanxi Guoli and Chengdu Wuniu playing in a top level All China Class A tournament.  A section of the crowd, angered by a decision of the referee during the game, gathered outside the stadium afterwards and tried to attack the official.  When the police intervened, their car windows were smashed and fighting broke out.  Eight people were arrested, but were later released.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
