         Slobodan Milosevic, former President of Yugoslavia, is the first head of state to be tried in an international court for war crimes and genocide.    The producers of The Death of Yugoslavia - the series that won 16 major awards in 1996 - return with this gripping and definitive documentary series.    It charts Milosevic's fall from the height of his power in 1995, when he was feted by world leaders as the only hope for peace in the Balkans, to his trial in the Hague for war crimes and genocide.    This is the inside story with extraordinary access to leaders across Europe, America and Russia: President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Jacques Chirac and Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, recount how they were drawn into a bombing campaign against Milosevic – and how the fierce arguments between them almost brought defeat.    The series also tells the story from the Yugoslav side, from those closest to Milosevic: his wife and political partner, Mira Markovic, his deputy Milan Milutinovic and Army Chief of Staff, Nebojsa Pavkovic, describe how Milosevic refused to take the threats to his power seriously either from NATO or from his own disillusioned electorate.    Milosevic's successors, President Voyjaslav Kostunica and Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, tell how they plotted his removal.    Milosevic's generals and policemen describe how they disobeyed Milosevic's orders to fire on protestors and allowed the newly elected government to supplant and later arrest him.    The three 90 minute programmes are:    Defiance - how Milosevic tried to steal an election in Serbia and intensified ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.    War - how the West won the 1999 war in Kosovo – and how Russia nearly stole the victory.    Finished - how Milosevic lost the September 2000 election and was finally forced from office to stand trial for genocide.    Executive producer Norma Percy said: "As the trial of Milosevic enters its second year, the series tells the story of how he moved from presidency to prison cell.    "But it also gives insight into the preparation for the Iraq confrontation today: it shows how America overcame the Europeans' refusal to go to war without a UN resolution – and how a threatened Russian veto was finessed."       Executive Producers: Norma Percy and Brian Lapping for Brook Lapping and Alex Holmes for the BBC.          The Fall of Milosevic will be broadcast on BBC TWO in January 2003.

In 1995 they jointly won the Royal Television Society judges award which recognises an outstanding contribution to television journalism over many years.    In November 2002, they won the first News World documentary award for their last series Avenging Terror. The citation said:    "These programmes turned heads of state into talking heads to tell a story that was, in its way, as vivid and startling as the most graphic news bulletin images."    The Death Of Yugoslavia (1995), six programmes for BBC TWO which charted Milosevic's rise to power, won 16 major awards including the BAFTA, the Broadcast Press Guild, the US EMMY and the Peabody.    It was the first foreign made programme to win Columbia University's journalism school's highest award, the du Pont Gold Baton.    The series was broadcast in more than 50 countries and repeated all over the world during the 1999 Kosovo war.

Norma Percy is a fellow of the Royal Television Society and in 2000 was awarded the James Cameron prize by the school of journalism at City University for some of "the most remarkable current affairs television of the last 20 years."
