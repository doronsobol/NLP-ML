Former X Factor contestant Rylan Clark and TV and radio presenter AJ Odudu have joined the line-up for Big Brother's Bit On The Side.  Emma Willis, who will host the next series of Big Brother, will present the spin-off show on Channel 5 along with the Clark and Odudu.  Rylan Clark won this year's series of Celebrity Big Brother after finishing fifth on The X Factor in 2012.  "I have followed the show since the very beginning," he said.  "It was a dream come true to enter the Celebrity Big Brother house this year, let alone win it.  "Being offered the job to present Big Brother's Bit On The Side was amazing."  A new show has been announced as well, Big Brother's Bit On The Psych, which will feature a panel of experts and psychologists who will analyse the behaviour of the housemates every week.  There's also a new Sunday lunchtime edition of Bit On The Side, which will be fronted by Rylan Clark.  AJ Odudu said: "It's going to be brilliant fun hooking up with Rylan and Emma for Big Brother's Bit On The Side.  "I can't wait to find out who the housemates are and get stuck in."  Ben Frow, director of programmes at Channel 5, said: "Big Brother's spin-off shows have a history of bringing on new talent and with Rylan and AJ I think we have two future stars."  Big Brother will return later this year on Channel 5 and there will be live streaming nightly between 7-9pm on 5*.  The show was broadcast for 10 years on Channel 4 until it was axed in 2010. Channel 5 started showing the series the following year.
