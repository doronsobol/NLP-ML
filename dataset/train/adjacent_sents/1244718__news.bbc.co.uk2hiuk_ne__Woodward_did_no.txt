Woodward did not run for re-election in his safe Conservative seat of Witney in Oxfordshire, instead being selected for the ultra-safe Labour seat of St Helens South in Merseyside.

               Tory recriminations over the defection of Shaun Woodward are expected to continue as the MP begins his career with the Labour Party.            The message still doesn't seem to be sinking into the leadership. We cannot afford to lose people like Shaun Woodward    Tory members in Mr Woodward's Witney constituency will meet on Monday night and are expected to call on him to stand down and face a by-election.      However, the new Labour MP has already ruled out such a move and has renewed his attack upon his former party.      Mr Woodward warned Conservative leader William Hague that a number of other Tory MPs could be ready to follow his lead and defect.     He is not expected to sit in the Commons on Monday, postponing what will inevitably be a hostile reception from former colleagues.         Can I join your party? - Woodward celebrates with Jack Straw   But Mr Woodward said: "It's not me who left my party. My party left me."      Writing in The Express newspaper, he said: "Their arguments simply prevent the leadership realising the modern Conservative Party is increasingly right-wing, out of touch and intolerant.      "They also stop the Tory Party understanding why I, like so many other former Conservative supporters, feel our natural home is now a New Labour Party which is building a modern, prosperous and fairer country."      Mr Hague has yet to speak publicly about the damaging defection. But the move has prompted warnings over policy to the Tory leader.      Senior Tories have urged Mr Hague to learn lessons from Mr Woodward's decision to change sides.        Michael Heseltine: Shaun Woodward will become 'a dot on the horizon'   Lord Hurd, Mr Woodward's predecessor as Tory MP for Witney, said: "If everybody who shares the kind of concerns and anxieties that Shaun Woodward had left, then the party would never be elected to govern."      He added: "The leadership must find a way to keep these doors open for people who have anxieties about issues like Europe and homosexual rights, but who nevertheless feel more Conservative than Labour.      "These people exist in large numbers and they are going to be crucial in getting the Conservatives elected."      MP Ian Taylor also urged Mr Hague to rethink his policies.            The Conservative Party has not gone to an extreme right position This is just another spin of Tony Blair's spin doctors    But former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, whose pro-European views are at odds with the party's line, insisted that Mr Woodward's criticisms were unfounded.      He predicted the Tories would return to power "from a position that is essentially a one-nation centralist position".     Conservative chairman Michael Ancram, accused Mr Woodward of self-centred careerism.     "Shaun has decided for his own reasons to leave the party and no amount of sincerity or fake sincerity is going to hide that fact," he said.      "He is a man of great ability and he is also a man of great plausibility, and what is now becoming apparent is that what he lacks is candour and honour."      Labour unease at defection         Mr Woodward is the third Tory MP to defect to New Labour, yet not all the party's MPs share Downing Street's delight at his move.      Left-winger Jeremy Corbyn said: "I am not comfortable that somebody who organised the 1992 Tory election campaign which complained about Labour's so-called tax bombshell should now say the his suddenly so fed up of the Tories that he is joining Labour."      Veteran Labour MP Tony Benn urged Mr Woodward to face the voters in a by-election.      "If he's joined Labour fine and great, but he'd better prove that he's wanted in Parliament. I think that principle is one we've got to re-establish," he said.
