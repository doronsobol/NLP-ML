The session was disrupted by an incident which involved de la Rosa when he struck the barriers at turn 12 – the session was prematurely ended as marshals were required to clear the track – and Herbert clipped the tyre barrier at turn 14 after spinning on oil on the circuit.

Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher dominated the morning warm-up session ahead of Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix.  Barrichello pipped his more celebrated team mate with a best lap of one minute 22.521 seconds, five-hundredths of a second faster than Schumacher, who gained pole position in Saturday's qualifying.  The world championship leader, who will be chasing his 40th career victory, was two-tenths of a second faster than his brother Ralf Schumacher in the Williams with McLaren's David Coulthard fourth.  Italy's Jarno Trulli, who drove his Jordan to a superb second spot on the grid in qualifying, was fifth fastest.
