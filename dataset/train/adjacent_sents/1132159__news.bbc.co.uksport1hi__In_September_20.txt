The 29-year-old left the Cherries for Portsmouth in March 2002 but was badly hurt in only his second game.  He returned to Dean Court for a second spell in November 2004 and was promoted to player-coach last December.  Howe said: "Playing for Bournemouth was an honour and a privilege. I enjoyed my career alongside some great players."  Howe is expected to remain on boss Kevin Bond's backroom staff and has been touted as a future Bournemouth manager.  Reflecting on his career, he said: "I wouldn't change anything - bar the injuries.  "Everyone knows they were the team I watched when I was younger and making my debut against Hull in 1995 was a big high in my career.  "Who knows whether I will go into management? I'm ambitious, I want to progress and want to feel like I'm improving. Whatever happens, will happen."
