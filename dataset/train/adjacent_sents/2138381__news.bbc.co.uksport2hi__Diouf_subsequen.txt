"We will be contacting El-Hadji Diouf to see if he wishes to provide us with a statement," said an FA spokesman.  But Emre's agent Ahmet Bulut said: "This is not a true story."  Emre, 26, already faces a personal hearing after denying a charge of using racially-aggravated language in his side's defeat at Everton in December.  Toffees keeper Tim Howard and defenders Joleon Lescott and Joseph Yobo reacted furiously towards the 26-year-old Emre after Newcastle had won a penalty during Everton's 3-0 win.  The Turkey midfielder has requested a personal hearing for that charge.  The alleged incident involving Diouf took place at St James' Park on 15 October.  Bolton won the match 2-1 with both goals scored by Diouf.  And Emre's agent added: "Emre is very upset about the allegations and is confident he will clear his name."  Turkey international Emre has not played for Newcastle since the draw with Manchester United on New Year's Day as he recovers from a calf problem.  Bulut has claimed Emre is devastated by accusations stemming from the Everton game.  And Emre has repeatedly protested his innocence in interviews in his own country.
