Further inspections showed that the pillars supporting the building were severely damaged and investigations of damage to the foundations will determine whether the cathedral can be rebuilt on the site.

A New Zealand TV reporter has been inside the country's earthquake-hit Christchurch Cathedral, which was badly damaged by a 6.3-magnitude quake on Tuesday.  Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker says more than 100 people are feared buried in collapsed buildings in the city.  The disaster struck at a shallow depth of 5km (3.1 miles) at lunchtime when Christchurch was at its busiest.  The BBC's David Shukman looks at why the disaster has been so devastating.
