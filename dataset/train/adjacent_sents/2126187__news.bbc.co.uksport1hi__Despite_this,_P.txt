Despite this, Pr≈°o's agent stated early in 2007 that he would like to continue playing for Rangers if his fitness allowed it, only to announce in February 2007 that his retirement was potentially imminent.

Prso has confirmed that persistent knee problems have forced his retirement from international football after representing Croatia at the World Cup.  And he told the Sportske Novosti daily: "I'm 32, my knee is in bad shape and the end of my soccer career is near."  He has a year left of his contract and added: "I'll sit down then with my family and see what is best for me."  Prso, as he had been last season, again looked Rangers major threat as they defeated Middlesbrough in a pre-season friendly on Saturday, setting up the only goal of the game for Thomas Buffel.  But the summer was not a happy one for the striker, with Croatia being knocked out in the group stages in Germany.  And Prso, who scored nine goals in 29 international appearances, said it "was the biggest disappointment in my life".  "I wanted to say goodbye to the team with style, not that way," he said.  Croatia national federation head Vlatko Markovic had travelled to Glasgow in an attempt to persuade Prso to continue his international career.  But Prso insisted: "I had to retire some time and I have decided that that moment has come."  Prso made his debut in the national squad in a March 2003 European Championship qualifier against Belgium.  Croatia won 4-0, with Prso scoring two of the goals to confirm that he was the natural successor to the retired Davor Suker.  He had left Croatia in 1994, during the 1991-95 Serbo-Croatian war, for France and has since played for Rouen, St Raphael, Ajaccio, Monaco and Rangers.
