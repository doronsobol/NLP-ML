The exhibit is opening in phases with phase one including a boat trip around the enclosures for visitors to view some of the zoo's key species from South East Asia, including Visayan warty pigs, southern cassowary, banteng and lowland anoa.

Work is to start on a multi-million pound development at Chester Zoo after planning permission was granted.  The Â£30m islands project will offer a boat ride where people can see plants and animals from south east Asia.  Linked by a series of bridges, the development will be home to animals including tigers, orangutans and crocodiles.  Work on the project is expected to start in the new year and be completed by Easter 2015.  The project will also include educational exhibits, play areas and restaurants.  The zoo's director general, Dr Mark Pilgrim, said he thought the animals would be a huge draw, adding: "It will be the first time a UK zoo has attempted anything on this scale."
