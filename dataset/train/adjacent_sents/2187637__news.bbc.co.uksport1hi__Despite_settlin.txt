Despite settling in the area, however, he failed to regain a starting place in the team and in October 2003, he joined Derby on loan, scoring once against Ipswich Town.

West Bromwich Albion striker Danny Dichio believes moving to the Midlands will help him regain his starting position with the Division One high-flyers.  Last season the 28-year-old commuted to the Hawthorns from the south of England but he has now moved north with his family.  Dichio said: "My family are all up here now and the boys like it here.  "It's a lot of pressure off my mind travelling wise, having to do a 30-minute drive instead of the hour-and-a-half I used to do.  "The little one is at school and he is gaining a bit of a Brummie accent now."
