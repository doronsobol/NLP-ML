Golden Girls star Betty White has created a calendar to raise funds for a wildlife charity in the US.  The 88-year-old, who recently became the oldest person to host Saturday Night Live, is waited on by young male attendants in one shot.  Royalties from the actress's 2011 calendar will go towards the Morris Animal Foundation which White supports.  Fans of the star have lobbied for her to be the presenter of next year's Academy Awards in Los Angeles.  Other pages in the new calendar, which goes on sale in September, feature photographs from White's career and the actress with animals.  She was recently honoured for her work with Los Angeles zoo and named as an ambassador for its animals by the city's mayor.  White is best known for playing Rose in television sitcom The Golden Girls, which ran from 1985-91.  She recently became the sole surviving member of the main cast members following the death of actress Rue McClanahan, who played Blanche.  White most recently appeared in US sitcom Hot in Cleveland as cranky caretaker Elka.
