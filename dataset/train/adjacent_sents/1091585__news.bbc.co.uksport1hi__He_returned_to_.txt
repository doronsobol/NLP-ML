Aki Riihilahti headed Palace in front after 10 minutes, but Ipswich were level before half-time when Tom Soares unluckily deflected into his own goal.  Palace regained the lead seven minutes after the break when Clinton Morrison headed home Ben Watson's free-kick.  Ricardo Fuller nodded in Matt Richards' cross after 67 minutes, but was later sent off for making a gesture at fans.  Crystal Palace manager Iain Dowie:    "It was a difficult day. It was not a poor performance, but we had enough chances to have won the game. "We led twice, and should have killed the game off. Our final ball was not as good as it should have been and did not look as assured as usual at the back. "Now we need a big performance at play-off rivals Leeds on Tuesday."  Ipswich manager Joe Royle:   "Yet again we have finished the game with 10 men and yet again we are puzzled. "The fans were giving Ricardo a hard time, and in his frustration he stuck two fingers up at them. I don't believe that is a sending-off offence. "We played the better football and with a bit more luck we might have won."
