In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne, was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair.

The victim was stabbed three times following the altercation at Kirkby's Wine Bar in Baildon, West Yorkshire, on Sunday night.  A West Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: "There was a minor altercation earlier in the evening in the wine bar when comments were made about his ginger hair.  "He and a female friend left the bar and it was then that this unprovoked attack happened."  The victim was described by police as "comfortable" in hospital after treatment for his wounds.  Detectives are looking for two men who fled in a K-registered Vauxhall Astra car.
