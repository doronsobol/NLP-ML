The next two gigs in the tour, at the NEC and Manchester Evening News Arena were cancelled because of "acute laryngitis" and were rescheduled for late November.

His tour promoter has played down reports that the 60-year-old told the audience it would be his final gig.  "I've spoken to his doctor, and it's clear it's just exhaustion and stress," said Andrew Miller. "It's not his last ever gig, that's for sure."  Mr Miller went on to say that he hoped Meat Loaf's gig in Birmingham on Friday would go ahead as scheduled.  "He'll be fine," he said. "We hope that 24 hours rest will get him better."  He added that claims the singer had told the audience it would be his "last ever gig" were "totally unfounded".  "I was backstage with him last night and he apologised, saying 'I'm just exhausted.'"  His comments, however, have prompted several audience members at last night's event to insist Meat Loaf announced it would be his final performance.  Meat Loaf had just launched into a performance of Paradise by the Dashboard Light when he abruptly stopped, thanked the audience and left the stage.  Shortly afterwards an announcement was made saying the singer had been taken ill.  A spokeswoman from Newcastle's Metro Radio Arena said the Bat Out Of Hell star had been forced to curtail the gig due to an inflammation of the larynx.  The singer - born Marvin Lee Aday in 1947 - has a history of health problems, having previously collapsed on stage at London's Wembley Arena in 2003.  Audience member John Robson told the BBC that Meat Loaf had seemed disorientated and dazed during his performance.  "It wasn't the Meat Loaf of 10 years ago," he said. "You could hear he wasn't getting to the notes he'd normally be getting to."  After Birmingham, Meat Loaf is due to perform in Manchester, London, Nottingham and Cardiff.
