There was a particularly vindictive round of correspondence sent to Private Eye regarding the duo, heralding a one-off letters page entitled The Great Newman & Baddiel Debate.

Stand-up comic, journalist and political activist Rob Newman has come a long way since his time performing comic impressions while studying at Cambridge University in the 1980s.  He came to national attention as part of the Mary Whitehouse Experience working in a regular double act with David Baddiel.  The pairing was so successful they went on to their own show, "Newman and Baddiel in Pieces".  That show's edgy attitude, combined with instantly quotable sketches like "History Today", Newman's good looks and the tangible tension between the two performers launched the early 1990s "comedy is the new rock'n'roll" phase that saw Newman and Baddiel selling out Wembley Arena.  To prove their rock'n'roll credentials, the pair split up acrimoniously following the Wembley gig and have never worked together since.  He now concentrates on writing and comic activism, turning up occasionally on panel shows to remind us just how very funny he is.
