An overview of the plan for the 2012 Olympics in London. On 15 March 2007 the government announced the budget for the Games had risen from £2.4bn to £9.35bn, although she said the cost of the Games would be £5.3bn. New venues will cost £3.1bn. These include the Olympic Park at Stratford and the athletes' village. There will be £1.7bn spent on regeneration and infrastructure. £600m will be spent on extra security. The government has set aside £2.7bn in a contingency fund in case costs rise further. The Olympics will have to pay an £840m tax bill. £390m will be spent on other costs, such as the Paralympics and community sport. Income: The government will provide £6bn, with other funds coming from London council tax payers and the National Lottery. Further income will come from International Olympic Committee TV and marketing deals (£560m); sponsorship and official suppliers (£450m); ticket revenues (£300m); licensing (£60m); London Development Agency (£250m) There will be 9.6 million tickets for sale - 8 million for the Olympics and 1.6 million for the Paralympics. Organisers say 75% of all tickets will cost less than £50 and offer free travel on London transport. A sell-out rate of 82% for the Olympic Games and 63% for the Paralympics is estimated. Tickets for the athletics will start at £15 and there will be 20,000 £10 tickets for the Olympic Park to watch events on big screens.

Each apartment will have a TV, internet access, a private courtyard. The dining hall will cater for 5,500 athletes at a time. The Olympic Village Polyclinic will be converted into a lifelong learning centre for the east London community, with a nursery, primary and secondary schools. The village will be converted into 3,600 apartments. Most of them will be affordable housing. The media and press centre would become a creative industries centre for east London. After the Games four arenas would be 'deconstructed' and relocated to other parts of the UK along with the swimming pools that are used for water polo and the 50m training pools. Charities will be given the sports equipment used in the Games for free. Tessa Jowell will be Olympics Minister, responsible for delivering the Games. Government will create an Olympic Delivery Authority to ensure delivery of Olympic infrastructure and new venues. There will also be a Cabinet-level Olympic Security Committee to co-ordinate all security planning. 80% of athletes would be within 20 minutes of their events and 97% of athletes within 30 minutes of their events. 93% of training venues are to be within 30 minutes of the athletes village. The aim is for 90% of venues to be served by three or more forms of public transport. There will be two major park and ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars, within 25 minutes of the Olympic Park. There are 9,000 planned park and ride spaces to be made available at Ebbsfleet where spectators can board a 10-minute shuttle service to the Olympic Park. This is the same station where continental spectators travelling by Eurostar will join the shuttle to the Olympic Park. It is predicted that on event days 78% of spectators are likely to travel from within London and 22% from the rest of the UK and Europe. Organisers estimate 80% of visitors and staff of the Games will use rail services to reach the Olympic Park. Low or no-emission vehicles will be used to transport Olympic athletes and officials. A tri-generation plant will supply electricity, heat and chilled water to the Olympic Park using technology which produces 33% lower CO2 emissions than from the electricity grid. By 2012 it is estimated that over 135,000 hotel rooms will be available within 50km of the Olympic Park, up from 120,000 presently. According to London 2012, for the first time in any Games live Olympic backdrop presentation facilities will be available to broadcast rights holders via rooftop studios on the main press centre with a direct view of the Olympic Stadium and Park.
