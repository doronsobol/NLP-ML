The former Republic of Ireland boss met the Leeds squad at Thorp Arch on Monday morning before signing a contract until the end of the season.  He left his role as Republic boss in October after an unsuccessful Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.  He told the club website: "It's a great opportunity to work at a big club with a great manager and learn the ropes from someone else on the inside."  Staunton, who won 102 international caps for the Republic, has previously worked with McAllister at Coventry.
