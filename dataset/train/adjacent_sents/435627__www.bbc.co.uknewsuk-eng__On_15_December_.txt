A former Labour MP accused of making illegal parliamentary expenses claims is set to stand trial in the spring.  Former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, 56, did not appear at Southwark Crown Court for a brief hearing earlier.  Ms Moran, from Southampton, faces 15 charges of false accounting and six of using a false instrument relating to expenses claims of about £80,000.  A provisional trial date was set for 18 April. A further directions hearing is to be held on 15 December.  Ms Moran, of Ivy Road, St Denys, is yet to enter pleas.  It is alleged she made claims for homes in London, Luton and Southampton.  She is also accused of submitting forged invoices.  Ms Moran, who stood down at the last election, faces charges including an allegation that she dishonestly claimed £22,500 to repair dry rot at her Southampton home.  She is also accused of falsely claiming £14,805 for boiler repairs and work on her conservatory.
