Tynwald members have approved a Â£44m project to strengthen and extend the runway at the Isle of Man airport.  Transport Minister David Anderson's motion was passed unanimously by the Legislative Council, having earlier progressed through the House of Keys.  The project involves extending the runway 245m (804ft) out to sea along a purpose built promontory.  Airport bosses say the extension will bring it into line with the latest international safety standards.  Work on the project is scheduled to start in May, with resurfacing due to follow in July.  The construction of the rock-armoured promontory will begin in April 2009, with completion expected by December 2009.
