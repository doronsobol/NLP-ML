The 47-year-old Welshman took Stoke to 12th in the Championship last season after once topping the table.  Chairman Gunnar Por Gislason said: "Despite all the good work he has done, he has failed to implement the strategy of exploiting foreign markets.  "It is felt we will again fail to exploit those markets this summer with him in control."
