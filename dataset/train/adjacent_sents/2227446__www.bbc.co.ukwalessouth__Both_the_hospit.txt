The Flat Holm Project runs boat trips to the island from its base in Cardiff. These visitors are on a Careers Wales teacher placement day. The lighthouse is one of the first notable landmarks you see. Herring gulls nest on the cliffs of the island. Where there are birds you'll also find slow worms. You can also see the neighbouring island of Steep Holm. Many of the buildings around the island have fallen into disrepair. The rusty gun barrel shows evidence of the island's Victorian fortification, while the bunker was built in World War Two. The journey home offers another chance to view the scenery.
