David Amess achieved totemic status in the Conservative party on election night in 1992 when his unexpected hold of marginal Basildon for the Conservatives was the first clear demonstration that Labour would not win the election.  In 1997, he recognised that he was unlikely to repeat the feat and decamped to the safer Southend West, which he has represented since.  Mr Amess has been an MP since 1983, in which time he has not been awarded any front bench roles despite relentless backbench activity and party loyalty.  He did, however, serve as parliamentary private secretary to Michael Portillo for nine years.  Mr Amess is one of Parliament's most dedicated pro-life activists.  He also supports the reintroduction of capital punishment and is a keen supporter of animal welfare.  Mr Amess is one of the few Tory MPs to have voted in favour of a ban on hunting.
