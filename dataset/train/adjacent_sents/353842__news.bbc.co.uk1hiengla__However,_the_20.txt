However, the 2008â€“2012 global recession also saw these plans fail to materialise.

The Leicester Regeneration Company, which is behind the proposals, said it hoped to create a "smart" gateway for people visiting the city.  The plans include new shops, offices and car parking. The station entrance would also move from London Road to Charles Street.  Officials said the revamp could create 2,800 jobs and boost trade in the area.  John Nicoll from the Leicester Regeneration Company "It's a long old job.  "We have to secure the agreement of the East Midlands Development Agency which would need to put in a small amount of public money to make it all happen.  "So I guess it's going to be two to three years before we see very much happening, but these things take time to put together."  The company is discussing the plans with the city council and said it hoped to attract a developer to carry out the work in about 12 months time.  An alternative site will need to be found for Royal Mail which occupies part of the planned development site near the station.  Alan Meredith, from the Rail Passengers Committee, said: "Given the size and economic importance of Leicester we do really deserve a first-class station and this may be the opportunity of delivering it."
