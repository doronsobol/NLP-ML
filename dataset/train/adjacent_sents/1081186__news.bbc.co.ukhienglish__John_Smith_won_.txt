                 "This constituency combines the large industrial and port town of Barry, combined with the prosperous Vale of Glamorgan area. It had been in long-term Conservative control at Westminster until Labour took it at a by-election in 1989, only to lose it again at the 1992 General Election when the Tories won it by only 19 votes. That made it the most marginal seat in Britain, and the slender majority could not withstand the Labour landslide five years later in 1997, when John Smith won it for Labour with a majority of 10,532. The Conservatives came second with 18,522, the Liberal Democrats third with 4,945 and Plaid Cymru fourth with 1,393. In the 1997 devolution referendum, the Vale of Glamorgan council area voted No by the biggest majority in Wales, 12,837. The local Vale of Glamorgan council is firmly in Labour control, with Labour holding 35 of the 47 seats. The Conservatives have 7 and Plaid Cymru 5."
