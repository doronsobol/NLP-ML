The 1980s outfit, most famous for their anthem The Final Countdown, spilt up in 1992 after 10 years of success.  Europe sold more than 10 million albums worldwide and The Final Countdown was number one in 25 countries in 1986.  Lead singer Joey Tempest described their new material as "fresh and hard but still with the typical Europe melodies in focus."  Europe reunited temporarily for a millennium concert in Stockholm on New Year's Eve in 1999.  The band have talked about getting back together for some time and are currently recording some new material.  "To finally once again meet our fans throughout the world feels incredibly inspiring, it's them that made us what we are today," said bass player John Leven.  Rock music is enjoying a renaissance at the moment after years of playing second fiddle to dance music.  According to the British Phonographic Institute's figures, in 2002 rock records outsold pop, buoyed by records from acts such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Queens of the Stone Age.  Flamboyant British band The Darkness have become one of the most talked about bands of the year, with their 1980s-style stadium rock and outrageous outfits.
