In late 2006, after touring Europe and North America with new material, the band re-enlisted Godrich and resumed work in London, Oxford and rural Somerset, England.

Organisers say Help: A Day in the Life is the fastest-selling download album.  Stars recorded 22 songs on Thursday and Friday and by Monday lunchtime fans had spent £40,000 downloading the tracks.  It also features Keane and Kaiser Chiefs and will be released on CD on 26 September. A decade ago, the original Help album raised £1.25m for War Child.  Help: A Day in the Life, which costs £9.99 to download, is currently on the warchildmusic.com website and will be available on major download sites from Tuesday.  "We receive data from the Official UK Charts Company every week and no download bundle or album has sold anywhere near the amount that Help did in a single week let alone over just two days," he said.  The Official UK Charts Company said it was unable to confirm whether Help had set a record.  The War Child site crashed under the demand and the album is on course to be the biggest selling download album, organisers say.  Some fans have downloaded single tracks for 99p each and Radiohead's new song I Want None of This is currently the most popular choice.  Among the other offerings is Coldplay's How You See The World, which had been available in Japan but was remixed by the band remixed in New York on Thursday.  War Child patrons Keane recorded a version of Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road while Kaiser Chiefs covered I Heard It Through The Grapevine.  Antony and the Johnsons, fresh from picking up the Mercury Music Prize, contributed a version of John Lennon's Happy Xmas (War is Over) with Boy George.  Artists were asked to enter the studio at 1200 BST on Thursday, although some started work a few hours early. The completed album went online at about 1810 BST on Friday.
