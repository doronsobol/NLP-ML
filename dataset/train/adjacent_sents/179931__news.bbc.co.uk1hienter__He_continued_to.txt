Sir Jimmy Young has used his first newspaper column since his Radio 2 show came to an end to attack the BBC for its instances of "brutality".  Sir Jimmy, 81, presented his final lunchtime show on Radio 2 last month after half a century in broadcasting.  His anger at having to leave the station, his home since 1973, was evident as he told listeners it was not his idea to go.  In his new Sunday Express column, Sir Jimmy expanded on the bitterness he felt towards his former employer for making him leave his 12 to 2pm spot.  Sir Jimmy insisted he had "no axe to grind" but accused the BBC of having a "frightening" and "brutal" history.  He added: "I was going to write that I had enjoyed that relationship (with the BBC) but that wouldn't be true.  "Sometimes enjoyable, often not, would be a more accurate description."  Sir Jimmy thanked his listeners for their messages "ranging from dismay to outrage, at the BBC's decision to axe my enormously successful, award-winning programme".  In his column, Sir Jimmy also recalled "one of the BBC's many instances of brutality".  He described how, 1949, a producer allegedly cut short the career of an unnamed pop group because of an argument with their manager.  He also used his column to attack the BBC over the licence fee.  In 2002, Sir Jimmy had agreed to leave his 12 to 2pm show to do a weekend programme.  He then changed his mind and decided to retire from the BBC altogether.  In response to Sir Jimmy's renewed criticisms, a BBC spokeswoman said: "We are sorry that Sir Jimmy decided not to continue working for us."  She added: "Obviously he is entitled to his own viewpoint."  Former Newsnight stand-in Jeremy Vine will take over from Sir Jimmy on Radio 2 on 6 January.
