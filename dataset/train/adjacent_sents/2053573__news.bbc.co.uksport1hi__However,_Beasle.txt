The US international, 25, was stretchered off after colliding with goalkeeper Raphael Schafer.  Rangers manager Walter Smith told the club's official website: "He has to go for an operation, which he'll go to America for.  "We'll have a better idea after that. It will be months before he's back."  Smith said he was disappointed for the player as he was finding his best form before suffering the injury.  "It's a bigger blow to him in the sense that no players wants to be out for a considerable length of time," Smith added.  "But for us he was settling in and starting to do well. He has a bit of pace in the wider areas of the pitch, so we'll miss him."
