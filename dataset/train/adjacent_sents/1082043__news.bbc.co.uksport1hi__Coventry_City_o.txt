John Collins is considering hanging up his boots and moving into coaching when his Fulham contract expires in the summer.  The former Scotland midfielder, 35, has made only two first-team substitute appearances this season but was denied a loan move to Coventry last week.  And the former Celtic, Monaco and Everton player is now mulling over his future in football.  Collins' agent Raymond Sparkes revealed his client woulf consider four options - continuing playing, retirement, coaching and moving back to Europe.  Sparkes said: "What happens in the summer depends on what offers John gets.  "He's interested in coaching in the right environment and circumstances.  "He's in the process of doing his badges, which he started in Scotland last year.  "If he gets the right offer, he could stay playing at Fulham or go elsewhere in the UK.  "Going back to the continent is another option - as is retiring.  "John hasn't yet sat down with his wife and said 'what do we do?' But that decision day is coming."  Collins has fallen out of favour with Cottagers boss Jean Tigana, but he could stay on at Fulham as a coach if a new manager decides he has something to offer.  Tigana's contract expires in three months and he is unlikely to be offered a new deal.  Collins' move to Highfield Road was scuppered as Coventry could not afford to pay all his wages and Fulham refused to pay part of his salary.  Sparkes criticised Tigana for blocking the move, saying: "If Tigana isn't going to play him, why not let him go and play?  "That would have shown respect for John as he's always been a very good pro."
