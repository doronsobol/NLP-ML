He also holds records for the most consecutive non-finishes, 18 across 1985 and 1986 (although many of these were mechanical failures), as well as the most successive non-finishes in a single season, 12 in 1987.

Former Formula 1 driver Andrea De Cesaris has died at the age of 55.  The Italian was killed in a motorbike accident in Rome, the official F1 website confirmed.  He started 208 races in his Formula 1 career between 1980 and 1994, but never won a Grand Prix, a record for the most races without a win.  He drove for McLaren for one season in 1981 and also raced for teams including Jordan, Brabham, Dallara and Alfa Romeo.  McLaren tweeted: "All at McLaren send condolences to ex-McLaren #F1 driver Andrea De Cesaris, who sadly passed away today."  De Cesaris won world championship points for nine of the 10 teams he raced for and finished on the podium five times.  In 1982, aged 22, he became the youngest driver to start a Grand Prix from the front of the grid after he took his sole career pole, with Alfa Romeo, at the US West round.  Following his F1 career, he raced in the Grand Prix Masters series for two seasons in 2005 and 2006 alongside veterans including Nigel Mansell, Emerson Fittipaldi and Ricardo Patrese.
