But this comment proved to be premature as Pr≈°o announced he would part company with Rangers at the end of the 2007 season due to his recurring knee problems.

The 32-year-old Croatian, who is out of contract in the summer, has been dogged by a persistent knee injury and was seen by a specialist on Tuesday.  Agent Ranko Stojic told the Daily Record: "Dado has been told he can play on for a minimum of one more season.  "Dado wants to play on for as long as possible and he is feeling much better than he was a few weeks ago."  The former Monaco forward retired from international football after last year's World Cup.  And he has been missing with a hamstring injury since 13 January.  "He will see how things go between now and the end of the season but the doctor has said there are no risks for him or his club and there are no problems," added Stojic.
