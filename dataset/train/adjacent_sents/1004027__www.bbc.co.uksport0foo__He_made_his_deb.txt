Racing Santander have announced that they have signed defender Carlos Bocanegra on loan from Rangers.  The Spanish second division club said the 33-year-old United States captain had joined until June.  Bocanegra had feared that playing for Rangers now that they are in Division Three would harm his chances of being in the USA World Cup squad.  "It is a strange feeling because I really enjoy it here and I am club captain," he said.  "But this is a deal that benefits both parties.  "In saying that, I am excited about playing in Spain and the fact that I get the chance to come back."  Bocanegra's international team-mate, Maurice Edu, had earlier completed a permanent switch to Stoke City.
