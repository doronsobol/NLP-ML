In November 2006, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and MSNBC reported that he was working on a new album, produced by will.

Earlier this year, the Two Seas label announced it would release the singer's new album, his first since 2001.  At the time it was reported that Two Seas was a joint venture between Jackson and a member of the Bahraini royal family, Abdulla Hamad Al-Khalifa.  But Jackson's US spokeswoman, Raymone Bain, says the singer is no longer affiliated with the label.  Guy Holmes, chairman of UK label Gut Records, had been named manager of Two Seas, and was expected to oversee the production of Jackson's new album.  But his company told the BBC no deal had ever been formalised with the US pop star.  Jackson, 48, has now formed a new company, the Michael Jackson Company, which will look after his business affairs, and may act as a recording label for his next record - due in 2007.  Reports in the music press suggest the album will be produced by Teddy Riley, who previously worked with Jackson on hits such as Remember The Time and Jam.  But the singer's spokeswoman was unable to confirm these reports.  Jackson has lived in the Middle East since being acquitted of child abuse charges in 2005, but he has continued to face a series of legal challenges in the US.  His most recent recording project, a charity single for the survivors of Hurricane Katrina, has yet to see the light of day.
