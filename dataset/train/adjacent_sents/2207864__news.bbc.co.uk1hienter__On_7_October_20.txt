She stitched the piece - called Tracey Emin Loves The Bill - to celebrate the show's 21st anniversary.  Bosses at UKTV Gold asked Emin to make a piece after hearing The Bill was her favourite programme.  The artwork will go on display in the canteen or reception area of the studio in south London where the ITV1 drama series is filmed.  The 41-year-old artist said she watched old episodes of The Bill every morning.  Emin said: "I get up at 7am and make a pot of tea, feed the cat and then write letters and things while I watch The Bill on UKTV Gold.  "I love spotting all the stars from the other soaps who've crept in."  Emin stitched the words 21 Years of Good TV and Great Hair onto a piece of 75cm by 65cm blanket.  A UKTV spokeswoman said: "Most people are struck by The Bill's uniforms or helmets but Tracey has come at it from a left-field perspective. We're not sure what the hair is about."  The piece was presented to some of the show's cast, including Mark Wingett and Trudie Goodwin, who play characters Pc Jim Carver and Sergeant June Ackland.
