A regional Mexican political leader, Braulio Zaragoza, has been killed by gunmen at a hotel restaurant in the popular resort of Acapulco.  Mr Zaragoza was in a meeting with other politicians on Sunday morning when three gunmen approached his table and shot him several times in the back.  He was the leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) in southern Guerrero state.  Several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area.  Police say an investigation is under way but no arrests have yet been made.  Mr Zaragoza, 35, died before paramedics arrived at the El Mirador Hotel.  He was having breakfast with two local politicians before a meeting with regional leaders from his party in Acapulco's port area.  Last week, a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the governing PRI party, Gabriel Gomez, was kidnapped south of the city of Guadalajara.  His burnt body was found a few days later in a car in the central state of Zacatecas.  Mr Gomez, 49, was a paediatrician who previously served as the mayor of the town of El Grullo in Jalisco state, also plagued by gang related violence.
