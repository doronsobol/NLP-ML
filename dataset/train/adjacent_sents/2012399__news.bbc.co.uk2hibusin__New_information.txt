The Peugeot 107 is among cars being recalled by the French carmaker Peugeot Citroen, Europe's second-biggest carmaker, is recalling some cars made with Toyota in Europe. "For Peugeot 107s and Citroen C1s, we are going to carry out an identical campaign as Toyota," a spokesman said. The Japanese car giant has now recalled millions of cars worldwide with faulty pedals. Both models are made in a Czech plant, a joint venture with Toyota that assembles around 200,000 Peugeot and Citroen cars every year. Peugeot said "under 100,000" cars will be recalled. It did not say when the recall would begin. Toyota is recalling up to 1.8 million cars across Europe, including about 220,000 in the UK, following an accelerator problem. We understand that the current situation is creating concerns and we deeply regret it    Rival carmaker Honda has also announced the recall of 646,000 cars globally to fix a switch defect that could cause a fire. The Japanese carmaker said on Friday that it was not aware of any accidents resulting from the issue and that only a limited number of incidents involving accelerator pedals had been reported in Europe. Both Peugeot models are made in Kolin, east of Prague, and are made for the the European market mainly, the Peugeot spokesman said. The plant also makes the Toyota Aygo. The Peugeot 107, Citroen C1 and the Aygo are essentially the same car with different styling and fittings. The French carmaker has no other joint ventures with Toyota. "We understand that the current situation is creating concerns and we deeply regret it," said Tadashi Arashima, the chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe.
