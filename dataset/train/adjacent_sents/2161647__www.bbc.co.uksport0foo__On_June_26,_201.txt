Former Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham player Gudni Bergsson is recovering after being stabbed in the leg, media in Iceland are reporting.  Bergsson, who became a lawyer in his native country after ending his football career, was allegedly attacked as he rushed to a colleague's aid.  The former Premier League player, who featured for Bolton more than 300 times, was reportedly stabbed twice in the thigh.  He was later released from hospital.  However, his colleague is said to be in a critical condition following the alleged incident at the Reykjavik offices of law firm Legal Support.
