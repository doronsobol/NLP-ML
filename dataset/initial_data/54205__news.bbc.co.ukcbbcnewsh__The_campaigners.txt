Animal lovers have kicked up a stink in Vienna where horses could be ordered to wear nappies.  The city council has proposed that all horse and carriage drivers should put nappies on their animals to stop them going to the toilet in the street.  They reckon animal poo in the streets could put off tourists, and say it costs thousands of pounds a year to clean up.  But the horse and cart drivers, and animal rights people, think it's outrageous.  They say it would be uncomfortable for the horses, would stop them being able to flick away flies with their tails, and it would look ridiculous!  Campaigners against the idea lined up in the streets of Vienna, wearing nappies themselves, which spelt out the words 'Stop pooh bags'.  There are 140 horse-drawn carriages in Vienna, and all of the drivers are against the plan.  Now they've just got to wait and see if the council passes the motion.
