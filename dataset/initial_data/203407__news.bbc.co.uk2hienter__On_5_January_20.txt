The Grammy award-winning singer originally signed a $100 million (Â£76.3 million) contract to perform A New Day in 2003 and its run was later extended.  A theatre was built and designed especially for the show, and producers claimed nearly 2.5 million people have attended since its opening.  New costumes and songs are being prepared for the final few months.  Posting on her website, the Canadian-born star said: "When I began this adventure four years ago, I had no idea how magical this experience truly would be.

The final tickets for performances from August until December will go on sale on 1 March.  Caesars has yet to announce who will replace Dion.
