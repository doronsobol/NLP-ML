0,"Sat-nav will become ubiquitous in mobile phones A German/UK consortium has been asked to supply the first operational spacecraft for Europe's Galileo satellite-navigation system. OHB System and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) will build 14 satellites in a contract valued at 566m euros ($811m; £510m). The contract was announced by the European Commission in Brussels. Galileo is intended as an EU version of the US Global Positioning System (GPS), but with significant improvements. Its more advanced technology should give users quicker, more reliable fixes, and enable them to locate their positions with an error of one metre compared with the current GPS error of several metres. European Commission vice-president with responsibility for transport, Antonio Tajani, also announced contracts to purchase the rockets on which to launch the satellites, and system management to oversee the Galileo project implementation. ""With this and the upcoming awards for the remaining procurement packages, we are concluding a critical phase of the Galileo programme,"" he said. ""We can now focus on the actual roll-out and demonstrate to European citizens that Europe's own satellite-navigation system is firmly underway."" The total value of the contracts announced on Thursday is just over one billion euros. The contracts mean Galileo, which has been much delayed, should finally become operational in early 2014. At least 22 satellites to launch in batches in coming years Will work alongside US GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises real-time positioning down to less than a metre Guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances Suitable for safety-critical roles where lives depend on service ""Our schedule has the satellites rolling off the end of the production line in the second half of 2012,"" said Phil Davies from SSTL. ""We then fall into a steady state where we produce a satellite every six weeks or so. The first two will be ready for launch in October 2012,"" he told BBC News. Arianespace of France will launch the spacecraft. The value of its contract amounts to 397m euros ($569m; £358m). Arianespace will use Russian-built Soyuz rockets initially to send up the spacecraft in batches of two. By early 2014, it is thought there could be up to 16 spacecraft in the Galileo network, enough to make a significant difference to sat-nav users with Galileo and GPS-enabled receivers. Thales Alenia Space of Italy has been asked to provide the system support to pull the whole project together. Its contract is valued at 85m euros ($122m; £77m). Galileo should have been operational by now but the project has run into myriad technical, commercial and political obstacles, including early objections from the Americans who thought a rival system to GPS might be used to attack its armed forces. The first satellites will be launched in pairs on Soyuz rockets The venture came very close to being abandoned in 2007 when the public-private development-and-business model set up to build and run the system collapsed. To keep Galileo alive, EU member-states had to agree to fund the entire project from the public purse. What should have cost European taxpayers no more than 1.8bn euros will now probably cost them in excess of 5bn euros. The EU's continued commitment to the project despite severe budgetary and management failings is based on the belief that huge returns to the European economy will accrue from the investment. Already, GPS is said to have spawned global markets that are worth several tens of billions of euros annually. The new European constellation is expected to deepen and extend those markets as sat-nav functionality becomes ubiquitous in consumer devices such as mobile phones. Thursday's contracts are just the start of operational roll-out of Galileo. More satellites and rockets will be needed. There are also outstanding work packages that need to be awarded, for the ground control segments of Galileo. The three major contracts in this area should be awarded by mid-2010. THE GALILEO SYSTEM WILL HAVE FIVE SERVICES This will be 'free to air' and for use by the mass market; Simple timing and positioning down to 1m Encrypted; High accuracy at the cm scale; Guaranteed service for which service providers will charge fees Open service; For applications where guaranteed accuracy is essential; Integrity messages will warn of errors Encrypted; Continuous availability even in time of crisis; Government agencies will be main users System will pick up distress beacon locations; Feasible to send feedback, confirming help is on its way     "
1,"Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan is to be guest of honour at a gala event to help promote Indian cinema in the UK.  The actor will launch 23 1/2 Days of Bollywood, which starts on 2 May at Selfridges stores in London and Manchester.  Several film sets will be erected at the department stores by Nitin Desai, set designer for Indian movies including Salaam Bombay and the Oscar-nominated Laagan.  The events will include appearances by Bollywood stars, along with dance performances, film screenings, fashion shows, interviews and discussions with Indian authors. Bachchan is one of the biggest stars in Indian cinema, having appeared in more than 100 movies over the last three decades. In a BBC News Online poll in 1999, he was voted the greatest star of stage and screen of the millennium, ahead of Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir Alec Guinness. He became particularly known in the 1970s for thrillers like Deewar and Zanjeer, and was dubbed India's first ""angry young man"". He played mainly violent anti-heroes, and was admired by women for his handsome looks and deep voice.  He has a huge fan base. When he was seriously injured during the filming of his 1983 movie Coolie, thousands of fans kept vigil outside his hospital and millions more prayed for his recovery. After a temporary retirement from movies, and a short-lived attempt at politics, he became the presenter on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Laagan, a story of a group of poor farmers who challenge their British colonial rulers to a game of cricket, in order to escape a land tax, was nominated for best foreign language film at the Academy Awards. Bombay's movie industry produces about 800 films each year, making India the most prolific film-producing country in the world.  Andrew Lloyd Webber is also launching his latest West End musical, Bombay Dreams, in June and has promised to include the visual imagery of Bollywood musicals. Lloyd Webber has collaborated with film director Shekhar Kapur, the man behind the Elizabeth movie, as well as comedian Meera Syal and Bollywood soundtrack composer AR Rahman. Also this summer, the first major UK exhibition of posters and hoardings from Indian cinema will go on display at London's Victoria and Albert Museum. Cinema India: The Art of Bollywood, which starts on 26 June, will show the history of Indian film posters from the 1950s through to the present day."
2,"The death penalty should be ""available"" to the UK justice system for use in the most heinous of crimes, according Ann Widdecombe.  The Tory former Home Office minister made the claim as heightened emotion over the murders of Cambridgeshire's Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells has prompted commentators across the nation to consider the return of capital punishment for child killers.  Ben Page, from pollsters MORI, said that three-quarters of the population consistently say they believe the death penalty ""is suitable in some circumstances"", although lethal injection is the preferred method.  But the Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Michael Turnbull, said a return to state execution would mean society admitting defeat.  Miss Widdecombe, a Catholic and a supporter of a ban on hunting, said she had never believed in using the death penalty as a means of retribution.  But she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If it can be shown that it is a real deterrent and its availability, not its regular use, is enough to deter murderers and save innocent lives, then I think that is a case that can be made.""  Miss Widdecombe argued that in the five years up to 1970 when the death penalty was suspended, statistics showed that capital murder went up 125%.  ""I am not running around this morning, banging drums, calling for the restoration of the death penalty, because I think if you are going to have it, you first of all need it to be done very rationally and secondly not just on a tide of outrage,"" she said.  ""I am not interested in retribution, I'm interested in saving life.  ""Now if you can save life by having a death penalty, regardless of what methods used are ... then I would maintain that there is an argument to be made.""  Limits to the type of punishment would need to be made to ensure that it was not ""long and protracted and exceptionally cruel"".  ""I would also like some of the ritual to go away, the black cap, the eight o'clock walk - none of these are necessary,"" said the Maidstone and the Weald MP.  She warned that the UK must not follow the same route as America.  ""I think the big weakness in the US is the large amount of time that elapses in their dreadful system of people being on death row for 10 years at a time between the conviction and the application of punishment, we frankly have never had that in this country.""  Miss Widdecombe said she did not believe juries would be unwilling to find a defendant guilty if they knew he would be executed.  ""When we did have a death penalty, juries still did convict,"" she said.  ""I do not think it is at all likely that, particularly with the grosser and more horrible crimes, that juries who, after all do not have the responsibility of sentencing - that's for the judge - that juries would just release people.""  But Miss Widdecombe admitted: ""The miscarriage of justice is the single strongest argument against it.""  The Rt Rev Turnbull said a time of high emotion, generated by public anger to the deaths of Holly and Jessica, was not the time to make radical changes to the law.  He said using capital punishment would rule out the chance of rehabilitating offenders - an essential element of current sentencing.  ""If we are admitting defeat by putting the death penalty into place and killing off those who have committed dreadful crimes, then I think that is a detriment to society as it stands,"" he told Today.  But Miss Widdecombe added that she regarded the debate as vacuous as there was no appetite for a return of capital punishment within parliament.  ""One of the first acts of this government was to change the law to make capital punishment now something that will be determined by Europe and not by us,"" she said.  In 1969, Parliament voted to suspend the death penalty indefinitely. Repeated calls for its return have been consistently rejected.  A mandatory life sentence was introduced in its place.  James Hanratty, 25, was one of the last people to be executed before the abolition of capital punishment in the UK after he was convicted in 1962 of shooting dead scientist Michael Gregsten in Bedfordshire."
3,"The incidents all happened in the London area over four weeks in June and July.  The two men were taken to police stations in north London after being arrested in Birmingham, the Metropolitan Police said.  Police also carried out two raids on addresses in south London. No arrests were made but several people attended police stations voluntarily.  Two of the dead were mothers who were both shot dead in their homes at the end of June.  Avril Johnson, from Brixton, south London, and Michelle Carby, from Stratford in east London, were shot in the head in separate attacks five days apart.  Ferguson was also shot in his home, in Kingsbury, north west London, after three men broke in.  Police have also linked the incidents to an armed rape which took place in a couple's flat in the Clapham area of south London on 15 June.  A woman was raped in the attack and a man received serious stab injuries, police said at the time. The couple were also robbed.  Two people have already been charged with the murder of Avril Johnson and with the rape of the woman in Clapham."
4,"Manchester City moved to within touching distance of their first title for 44 years, as Yaya Toure scored twice to secure a crucial victory over Newcastle United.  The Ivory Coast midfielder beat Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul with a low curling shot with 20 minutes left.  He then added a second from close range with time running out.  City now know that victory over QPR in their final match of the season will secure the Premier League title.  ""Manchester City are one victory away from the title now. This was a vital win for Roberto Mancini's men but it was one they deserved. Roberto Mancini got the big calls right and perhaps made the most important substitution of the season. ""Bringing Nigel de Jong on for Samir Nasri was not a defensive substitution because it allowed Yaya Toure to roam free further up the field. It was the moment that changed the game. Toure scored twice, City won and the title is theirs to lose. ""Mike Summerbee, who scored here when City last won the title in 1968, was in the crowd with a tear in his eye. It has been a long wait for City but it is almost over.""  This was a dominant display by City, inspired by Vincent Kompany's defensive generalship, David Silva's prodigious work in midfield, stellar finishing by Toure and a workrate and ambition that glowed throughout the team.  The omens must have given Roberto Mancini's men cause for hope and optimism before kick-off.  It was at this ground on 11 May 1968 that City won to clinch their last league title. Some 44 years on, history repeated itself as City moved to within three points of the prize that has eluded them for so long.  While it was understandable that much of the attention focused on City, Newcastle were chasing a prize of their own.  Arsenal's 3-3 draw with Norwich City had opened the door to Champions League qualification.  It was fitting, then, that Sir Bobby Robson - the last manager to lead Newcastle into Europe's top club competition - had been immortalised before kick-off as the club unveiled a statue to honour his memory.  But it was City who dominated the opening 30 minutes. Sharper to the ball, swifter to use it, City forced Krul, the Newcastle goalkeeper, into action on a number of occasions.  The Dutchman was forced to turn away low shots from both David Silva and Sergio Aguero, while Carlos Tevez went close with a curling free-kick.  It took Newcastle half an hour to produce their first effort on goal, but more soon followed.  Demba Ba fizzed a 25-yard shot over Joe Hart's crossbar. Moments later the Newcastle striker saw his goalbound shot blocked by Kompany after a clever run by Jonas Gutierrez. The ball ran to Ben Arfa but his low shot was well saved by Hart, low to his left.  It was City, however, who had the best chance of the half shortly before the interval. The mercurial Silva broke clear down the left and cut the ball back to Gareth Barry near the penalty spot.  The England midfielder's first shot was blocked by Fabricio Coloccini, while his second found a path to goal only for Davide Santon to clear off the line.  City maintained their momentum after the restart with Tevez fired high and wide, before testing Krul from distance.  As the half wore on Mancini's side were struggling to convert their lion's share of possession into clear-cut chances.  Then came what proved to be an inspired substitution. Nigel De Jong replaced Nasri on the hour mark to allow Toure to push into a more advanced position behind Aguero and Tevez.  The Ivorian made an instant impact in his new role. Collecting a neat lay-off from Aguero, he curled a wonderful low shot beyond Krul's outstretched left hand to spark scenes of jubilation in the away end and on the City bench. It was the first goal Newcastle had conceded in 497 minutes of football at the Sports Direct Arena.  City should have made sure of the result four minutes later when Silva lofted a delightful through-ball into the path of Aguero only for the Argentine to nudge his shot inches wide of the right-hand post when clean through on goal.  Newcastle almost made City pay for their profligacy, when Ba and Papiss Cisse connected only for the latter to head high and wide from close range.  City were in charge, however. Aguero put Toure through on goal only for the City midfielder to slip at the crucial moment. Edin Dzeko turned a shot narrowly over the bar from the resulting corner.  It mattered not, though, when Toure made sure of the result and perhaps the title a minute from time, as he finished a typically swift City counter-attack with a close-range finish.  Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini: ""It is not finished. It is important that we get three points next week, we need a big effort - there is one game more. I think for us it should be a normal week. We don't change nothing, QPR will be tough, they are fighting for relegation. Nothing changes. It is ours to lose. It doesn't depend on other teams anymore.  ""Toure's first goal was special, like the one he scored in the FA Cup final for us last year. This one may be more important if we can finish the season off.  ""Newcastle are a good team, they have had a fantastic season. But we deserved to win today, we scored two goals and created three of four other chances to score more. Everyone played really well, the whole team played really well.""  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew: ""We knew the first goal was going to change everything. We didn't get it but we had a few chances to. Once that goal went in, we had to push on and that opened us up a bit.  ""It was a great performance by my team. You have to say Manchester City were brilliant today. When you can bring on one world star for another... that freshness just made the difference today. But it is never over in the race for the Premier League title, no matter who your opponents are.  ""We have great potential at this football club. We are back where we should be, we have tradition and history that few clubs can match. If we can win at Everton next week it will put massive pressure on Arsenal and Spurs. They have go to win now."""
5,"Two decades of war have laid waste Afghanistan's environment so badly that its reconstruction is now compromised, the United Nations says.  A UN Environment Programme (Unep) survey found more than half of Kabul's water supply is going to waste.  It found children working 12-hour shifts in dangerous factories, and sleeping at their machines.  More than half the forests in three Afghan provinces have been destroyed in 25 years.  A team from Unep's Post-Conflict Assessment Unit worked with the Afghanistan Transitional Authority to carry out the survey.  It involved 20 Afghan and foreign scientists in visits to 38 urban sites in four cities, and to 35 rural sites.  The team's report says the years of conflict have led to the ""collapse of local and national governance, destroyed infrastructure, hindered agricultural activity and driven people into cities already lacking the most basic public amenities"".  It says: ""Three to four years of drought have compounded a state of widespread and serious resource degradation: lowered water tables, dried-up wetlands, denuded forests, eroded land and depleted wildlife populations.""  Two million refugees returned to Afghanistan last year, and 1.5m more are expected in 2003, putting further strains on the country and its natural resources.  Dr Klaus Toepfer, Unep's executive director, said the report showed environmental restoration must be a major part of Afghanistan's reconstruction.  He said: ""Over 80% of Afghan people live in rural areas, yet they have seen many of their basic resources - water for irrigation, trees for food and fuel - lost in just a generation. In urban areas the most basic necessity for human wellbeing - safe water - may be reaching as few as 12% of the people.""  The report says Kabul's water system is losing up to 60% of its supply because of leaks and illegal use.  In Herat, only 10% of the 150 public taps were working. There, and in Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar and the capital, the team found medical waste from hospitals being disposed of in the streets and an abandoned well.  In some cases it contained syringes and human organs. Urban drinking water had high concentrations of bacteria contaminants, coliforms and E.coli from sewage.  Solid waste disposal, Unep says, is ""one of the country's most glaring problems"". Dumps are often sited above cities, where heavy rain can wash the waste back into the streets.  The report says: ""Unep investigations of oil refineries and transport terminals, and brick, asphalt and lead battery factories revealed acute environmental and human health risks.  ""In a plastic recycling/shoe factory in Kabul the team found children working without protection from toxic chemicals and sleeping at machines, or in factory alcoves, between their 12-hour shifts.""  In the countryside, it says, satellite imagery shows conifer forests in the provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar and Nuristan have shrunk by more than half since 1978.  Pistachio woodlands in northern Afghanistan, valuable money earners, have been devastated. The report says: ""Almost no trees could be detected in Badghis and Takhar provinces in 2002 by satellite instruments, compared with 55% and 37% land cover respectively in 1977.""  Inevitably, wildlife suffers: several hundred families had taken over an island in the Amu Darya river which was formerly home to otters, wild boar, Bactrian deer and birds of prey.  The team also spent two weeks on horseback in a remote area grazed by Kyrgyz and Wakhi herders, where there are snow leopards, Marco Polo sheep, wolves, brown bears and Asian ibex.  Unep says hunting, mainly for meat and furs, was significantly reduced during the Soviet occupation, but has increased since then."

Ja Rule paid $550 (£300) in fines and court fees at the Manhattan Criminal Court in New York.  Apple plan to give away 50 iPods when song sales from its iTunes Music Store reach 100 million, say reports.  The free iPods will go to the buyer of each 100,000th song downloaded between 95 million and 100 million songs.  ""We want to thank our customers who have made the iTunes music store such a stunning success,"" said Apple boss Steve Jobs.  Apple claim there will have been 95 million downloads worldwide by 2 July. ITunes launched in Europe last month.

Christian Bale, star of forthcoming sequel Batman Begins, has signed up to appear in Terrence Malick's fourth feature film, The New World.  The historic American epic tells the story of explorer John Smith and the clashes between Native Americans and the British in the 17th century.  Bale, 30, will play English tobacco planter John Rolfe in the film, which is due out next year.  David Thewlis, Colin Farrell and Christopher Plummer will also star.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers album Californication has been voted the best album of the last 10 years in a poll.  Oasis' (What's The Story) Morning Glory came second in the online survey by men's magazine FHM.  Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP was third, with U2 album All That You Can't Leave Behind placed fourth.  Californication was released five years ago and has gone on to sell more than 15 million copies for the US rock band who emerged in 1983."
7,"   The igloo's apparently simple design masks an engineering marvel and could teach modern builders a thing or two, says Dan Cruickshank, who helped build one for his new TV series. Last year I flew into the Arctic, heading for the east coast of Greenland. My plan was to see, indeed to help make, an igloo. This inspirational and economic miniature-engineering marvel has long fascinated me. How did the igloo evolve, when and where? No one knows for sure but traditionally they were built only by specific Inuit communities in relatively small areas of Greenland and Canada, and were used only for temporary accommodation in winter months, or by Inuit on hunting expeditions. What's more certain, although perhaps surprising, is that the humble igloo has a lot to teach the modern British house-builder. Last year, a report by the government's architecture watchdog, Cabe, found more than four in five new homes built in Britain since 2002 failed to meet the needs of those who came to live in them. By contrast, the design and construction principles enshrined by the igloo are enduring and are a response to the essential reasons people build - to create shelter from the elements and protection from danger. Yet the way the igloo achieves these basic aims is ingenious and raises it from a mere utilitarian structure to a piece of architecture. It is not just a highly functional habitation but also a creation of elemental beauty that's an intensely pleasing and perfect expression of its function and manner and means of construction. The igloo utilises what must be the potentially weakest of building materials - frozen water - and gives this unlikely structural material immense strength. Its domed form is not only a beautiful, and in many cultures a sacred form representing the heavens and Divine creation, but also a shape that is immensely strong. Dan Cruickshank's Adventures In Architecture is on BBC Two on Wednesdays at 2100 BST from 2 April Catch up on previous episodes at BBC iPlayer Frozen water - snow and ice - also have other striking qualities. It's the only readily cheap and available building material in much of the Arctic and is, of course, an utterly renewable resource. It's a construction material that causes no pollution whatsoever in its manufacture, use or disposal. This paradoxical material - weak in its nature yet capable of great strength when used with intelligence - is the product of low temperature but an incomparable insulator, so that an igloo excludes external cold while retaining all the internal heat that is generated. Consequently, an igloo can resist the onslaught of the most fierce freezing gale, while its interior can be rapidly warmed by nothing more than body heat and the flame of a blubber lamp. I landed at a tiny airport and made my way, across frozen fjords and pack ice, to the Inuit town of Ittoqqortoormiit to meet Andreas Sanimuinaq, who would teach me how to build an igloo; how its dome can be constructed with nothing more than a saw and without any need for props or supports during the construction process. We boarded a sleigh and went in search of the correct, wind-compacted snow needed for igloo construction. Soon we found the right place. Andreas stamped out a circle in the snow - the plan of the igloo - sung a song to dedicate the circular structure we were about to build to the life-giving sun, and we got to work. First we quarried blocks of snow - heavy brutes - and then carried them a few meters to the construction site, located on the snow-covered ice of the frozen fjord. The first three courses were laid, block on block with sides nearly vertical. The igloo is not a perfect hemispherical dome but more of an egg shape - in section a catenary arch - which is about the strongest form in nature. Halfway through the fourth course Andreas cut a wedge-shape block. This was the key structural moment. From here the blocks rose upwards in a continuous spiral - a far stronger construction technique than placing course upon course that allowed the dome during construction to be self-supporting. I also discovered, as we worked, that blocks are held not so much by their tailored form as by friction and freezing. Surfaces that are to be joined are rubbed with the ice saw, the ice melts through the heat of friction and the blocks are rammed and held together while the surface moisture freezes, with the ice acting as mortar. When we eventually completed the igloo I was able to enjoy the simple but effective science of the design. Hot air rises while cold air sinks, so as cold air lurked in the lower portion of the interior the warm air - created by our body heat - rose into the dome where it was trapped. We basked in this pleasant warmth while sitting on the high snow-block and skin-covered interior bench. The igloo is indeed a clever machine in which to live, for heat is balanced delicately against cold - it's a structure in which nature is harnessed to tame nature. As water, caused by our body heat, trickled down the interior surface of the igloo, it completely filled the joints between blocks to refreeze during the cold of the night to form a grout between slabs that excludes all draughts. This constant thawing and refreezing rapidly transforms the igloo from a house of snow into a far stronger and windproof dwelling of solid ice. But Andreas tells me that igloo construction is a dying art. The loss of the igloo is partly to do with changing culture - younger Inuit prefer to live in timber houses flown in from Denmark, and have little interest in learning the mystery of igloo construction. But perhaps more alarmingly, the demise of the igloo is to do with climate change. The area within the Arctic circle is now one of the most rapidly warming places on the planet. Here temperatures are rising nearly twice as fast as for the rest of the Earth and the permanent sea-ice cover has declined by almost 40% in the past 30 years. This means that building igloos in the areas where the Inuit live and hunt is becoming increasingly difficult. Snow of the right consistency is harder to find and it is ever more difficult to freeze blocks together. The igloo has many lessons to teach, but tragically it seems that it may not be around much longer to teach them.     "
8,"Former International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch has died in hospital after being taken ill at the weekend. The 89-year-old was admitted to the Quiron Hospital in Barcelona where he was being treated for heart problems. The Spaniard was widely regarded as the most powerful man in sport when he headed the IOC from 1980 to 2001. His successor, Jacques Rogge, said: ""I cannot find the words to express the distress of the Olympic family."" Rogge continued: ""I am personally deeply saddened by the death of the man who built up the Olympic Games of the modern era, a man who inspired me, and whose knowledge of sport was truly exceptional. He was quite simply the most intuitive leader I have ever met    ""Thanks to his extraordinary vision and talent, Samaranch was the architect of a strong and unified Olympic Movement. ""I can only pay tribute to his tremendous achievements and legacy, and praise his genuine devotion to the Olympic Movement and its values. ""We have lost a great man, a mentor and a friend who dedicated his long and fulfilled life to Olympism."" London 2012 chairman Lord Coe, who was close to Samaranch for three decades, said he had been an inspiration. ""I have lost a friend, one that moulded my path through sport from my early 20s, and the world has lost an inspirational man,"" said Coe. Probably the man who has made the Olympics such a spectacular and prestigious event that it is today. RIP Juan Antonio    ""A man that challenged us all to fight for sport, its primacy and its autonomy, a fight he led fearlessly from the front, creating an extraordinary sporting movement that reaches millions of people around the world. ""He was quite simply the most intuitive leader I have ever met."" Samaranch, who was admitted to hospital on Sunday with acute heart problems, died from cardio-respiratory failure. He had been plagued by ill-health in recent years, but continued to travel to IOC meetings around the world, and in February attended the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, walking with the help of a female assistant. Samaranch retired as IOC president in 2001, after 21 years at the helm. Only Pierre de Coubertin, the ""father"" of the modern Olympics - and IOC chief from 1896 to 1925 - had held the post for a longer period. Lamine Diack, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said Samaranach had used ""the skills of a natural diplomat"" to create a unified Olympic movement and make it the ""world's most influential sporting event"". ""But as well as his unique devotion to the Olympic movement and its values, I will never forget the deep respect and passion that Juan Antonio showed for the sport of athletics,"" he said. Dick Pound, a long-standing Canadian IOC member and the first president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, saluted Samaranch for creating an Olympics renaissance. ""He did essentially a two century jump. He got us from being in the remnants of the 19th century and got us into the 21st century,"" he said. ""He gave the organization financial stability, international presence and a certain gravitas it never had before."" Born in Barcelona on 17 July, 1920, Samaranch enjoyed success as a roller-skater and led the Spanish team to the world title. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. He pursued a career in sports politics in fascist dictator Francisco Franco's Spain and won a place on the IOC in 1966. After Franco's death, Samaranch was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union and the contacts he made there helped him succeed Lord Killanin as IOC president in 1980. He oversaw the commercialisation of the Olympics during the 1980s and 1990s and established the Games as a world force. BBC Radio 5 live Olympics correspondent Gordon Farquhar said of Samaranch: ""He took over during one of the movement's most difficult times, just before the Moscow games in 1980, which were affected by a US-led boycott in protest at Soviet foreign policy. ""The previous Olympics in Montreal had been a financial disaster, and the games were viewed as a burden, not an opportunity for the host nation. Only Los Angeles bid to stage the 1984 games. ""During his tenure, Samaranch helped revitalise the economic fortunes of the IOC through global sponsorship deals and marketing of TV rights. Professional athletes were fully embraced, finally ending the tradition of amateurism at the games."" During his tenure, Samaranch helped revitalise the economic fortunes of the IOC    Samaranch was criticised in some quarters for not taking the issue of doping seriously enough and for allowing bidding cities to ""over-indulge"" members. After 10 IOC members resigned or were expelled following a bribery scandal surrounding the Salt Lake winter Games, he introduced a series of reforms to clean up the organisation, including a ban on member visits to bid cities. Former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Craig Reedie defended Samaranch over the Salt Lake City scandal, saying: ""The good certainly outweighed the bad, if there was any bad at all. ""It was Samaranch who set up the commission to investigate the allegations, it was he who set up the reform commission and it was he who set up the ethics commission. ""Yes he must have been embarrassed by it but he then did something about it."" Simon Clegg, former chief executive of the BOA, said: ""He was a masterful politician and his contribution to the development of world sport cannot be underestimated."" Samaranch was made Honorary Life President after standing down in 2001, and in recent years was a key part of Madrid's failed bids to host the Olympics in 2012 and 2016, which were awarded to London and Rio de Janeiro respectively. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said: ""One of Spain's most emblematic figures has left us, a decisive figure in the resurgence of Spanish sport and in the Olympic movement inside our country. ""He was fundamental in Spain being awarded the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, and those Games were a tremendous success which in great part we owe to him."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said: ""Juan Antonio Samaranch was a very great figure of the Olympic movement. He is the man who furthered the increase in power of the Olympic movement by opening it to all sports and all countries.""     "
9,"The world's first iron-framed building will undergo redevelopment after being granted £12.8m in funding.  The Flax Mill Maltings in Shrewsbury will be the centre of a three-year regeneration that Shropshire Council hopes will create new jobs.  With a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the project will adapt a number of Grade I listed buildings, including a mill built in 1797, a kiln, an office and stables.  These will become offices.  The site in Ditherington, north of Shrewsbury town centre, contains seven listed buildings including the world's first iron-framed building, according to English Heritage.  The Flax Mill was operational from 1797 until 1897, and was then turned into a maltings until its closure in 1987.  The space is now being marketed to businesses with facilities to include broadband and free parking.  Long-term plans include the creation of 120 homes on surrounding land, but this is not included in this element of the project.  An exhibition space outlining the mill's history will also be included.  Alan Mosley, chairman of the Friends of the Flaxmill Maltings, called the lottery grant ""fabulous news"".  He said: ""Apart from protecting and opening up our internationally-important heritage to the public, the grant will bring tremendous - and much needed - investment, jobs, services, community facilities and hence, regeneration, to the area.""  Reyahn King, from the Heritage Lottery Fund, said the funding would ""celebrate and reuse our industrial past"".  English Heritage took over the mill in 2005 and created its redevelopment plan with Shropshire Council, the Friends of the Flaxmill Maltings and the Homes and Communities Agency.  In 2012, it was given more than £465,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to refine its development proposal.  Work is set to begin on the site in October 2013 and is due to be completed in early 2016."
10,"The all-round entertainer secured his first UK TV series in 1963 Veteran TV presenter Des O'Connor has announced he is stepping down as the host of Countdown at the end of the current series in November. He began as quizmaster on the Channel 4 show two years ago, replacing Des Lynam, who took over the reins when original host Richard Whiteley died. But the 76-year-old said he had no plans to retire unless he thought the public no longer wanted him. He will be working on his 36th album and is in talks about a West End show. The entertainer wouldn't reveal any details about the production but said it was ""something I've been keen to do"". Speaking of his time on Countdown, O'Connor said: ""It's been wonderful hosting a programme which is part of TV folklore. ""I've made a lot of new friends. Carol Vorderman has been a joy... it's been a giggle since day one. ""But I miss the thrill of stepping out on a live stage for the one-man concerts and the challenge of live TV entertainment-based shows."" He said quitting the show would also mean he will be able to spend more time with his family, including three-year-old son Adam. By the time he leaves, O'Connor estimates he will have anchored more than five hundred shows. The singer says he misses the thrill of doing live shows Fellow host Carol Vorderman, who has been with the programme since its debut 26 years ago, described O'Connor as a ""true gentleman"". She said: ""Audiences love him and we have had so many laughs in the studio and only last week we recorded some of our best shows."" As well as writing children's stories and poems, O'Connor is working on a new album with producer Alan Hawkshaw, with the working title Setting New Standards. He said he already had a series of concerts lined up for the autumn. The entertainer was recently awarded a CBE for his services to the industry. He landed his first TV series in the UK in 1963. Channel 4 has yet to announce O'Connor's replacement on Countdown, which was the first programme to be broadcast on the channel."
11,"Appeal judges in Bordeaux ruled administrative courts could not decide the liability of the operator SNCF.  Last June a court ruled SNCF must pay 61,000 euros ($81,300; £41,400) to the Lipietz family, whose members were taken to a camp near Paris in 1944.  The Lipietz case was brought by family members, including Alain, a member of the European parliament.  Georges Lipietz, his father, was taken at the age of 21 to the Drancy camp but was spared transportation to death camps by the Allied victory. Three other family members were similarly transported to Drancy, the lawsuit says.  The case was launched in 2001 and has continued despite Georges Lipietz's subsequent death.  It was taken to the administrative courts, which rule on lawsuits brought against the state.  But Tuesday's ruling said SNCF was an entity in its own right and should be covered by the traditional judicial system.  A lawyer for some of the plaintiffs against SNCF, Gerard Boulanger, said: ""It's a way for the administrative justice system to kick the issue into touch.""  SNCF has not yet commented.  It earlier argued it had no choice but to do as it was ordered by the Vichy government in collaboration with the German occupying army. Those who refused faced being shot, it said.  Records show SNCF billed the French state for third-class journeys, even though families were transported in cattle wagons.  The Lipietz family said it would now go to the highest administrative court, the State Council.  Other plaintiffs will have to go to criminal or civil courts, legal experts say.  However, a similar case in 2003 against SNCF in a civil court was thrown out as the 30-year statute of limitations had expired.  Between 1942 and 1944 some 76,000 Jews were deported from France."
12,"Prince Harry saw active duty with the Blues and Royals in Afghanistan Prince Harry is aiming to follow in his brother's footsteps by becoming a helicopter pilot, Clarence House says. The royal has started an Army selection process and will be ""graded"" next month to determine whether he can start the full Army Air Corps programme. Candidates need to prove their ability to make progress, but the failure rate is said to be high, at around half. Prince Harry's father, Prince Charles, and uncle, the Duke of York, have also learned to pilot military helicopters. Prince Harry has passed an initial aptitude test and if he successfully completes a four-week course, he will progress to full flight training in January 2009. Prince William was awarded his RAF wings on 11 April Candidates on the four-week course chalk up 13 hours of flying, during which they need to prove their ability to learn and progress, before undertaking the full training which takes 16 months. In April this year, Prince William was at the centre of a controversy when he landed a Chinook helicopter in a field belonging to his girlfriend Kate Middleton's family. Ministry of Defence officials said the sortie had been fully authorised as part of the prince's attachment to the RAF. Prince William was awarded his RAF pilot's wings on 11 April after training with the air force since January. In September, it was announced he is to train to become a full-time search and rescue pilot with the RAF. If Prince Harry successfully completes his selection and training process, he could fly one of three different types of helicopter; a Gazelle, Lynx, or Apache. Prince Harry could end up piloting an Apache attack helicopter The Gazelle and Lynx are use for reconnaissance and moving troops, while the Apache is used for attack purposes. The prince has already served two-and-a-half years in the Household Cavalry Regiment. He spent 10 weeks in active service in Afghanistan with the Blues and Royals starting in December last year. The Ministry of Defence would not comment on how likely he would be to serve in a war zone as a pilot. Prince Andrew, the Duke of York flew on various missions for the Navy during the Falklands war.     "
13,"Boy George was jailed in January and released on licence four months later Boy George has been told he cannot participate in the final series of Celebrity Big Brother, a judge at the High Court has ruled. The star's legal team had been trying to lift a Probation Service ban on him appearing on the Channel 4 show. The singer - real name George O'Dowd - was released on licence from prison early for imprisoning a male escort. Mr Justice Bean said the Probation Service was within its rights to refuse the star permission to appear. He added that somebody who is out on licence and the restrictions placed on their freedom are part of their punishment. ""I consider that right-thinking members of the public would take the view that an offender serving the non-custodial part of a sentence of imprisonment should not be allowed to take part in a high profile, controversial television production, promoting his status as a celebrity and with considerable financial gain,"" Mr Justice Bean said. A spokesman for the Probation Service said they were ""pleased"" with the judgement. ""We believe we made a common sense direction and this has been endorsed by the judge. ""We expect offenders to keep to their licence conditions which are in place to protect the public, punish offenders for their crime and aid rehabilitation,"" he added. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The 48-year-old former Culture Club singer and DJ went to the High Court to quash a decision by the Probation Service banning him from appearing on the show. On Tuesday Richard Clayton QC, representing the Probation Service, said O'Dowd's participation would pose ""a high level of risk"" to the service's reputation. The former Culture Club star is currently on licence and wears an electronic tag. Mr Clayton argued that if he used the show to promote his status as a celebrity and earn ""a lucrative sum of money"" it could undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system. But Alison MacDonald, representing O'Dowd, told the court his Probation Service licence was designed to monitor his behaviour, protect the public and rehabilitate rather than punish him. O'Dowd's lawyers could now take the matter further to the Court Of Appeal and ask the Lord Chief Justice if he will consider hearing the case. It is not yet clear whether the star's legal team will do that. The singer was convicted of false imprisonment after admitting handcuffing Norwegian Audun Carlsen to a wall in his London home in April 2007. Previously O'Dowd had been given permission to perform at Brighton's Gay Pride event in August.     "
14,"President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal of the breakaway region of Somaliland, has commented for the first time on the results of last week's independence referendum in which voters backed cessation from Somalia.  President Egal said Somaliland was no longer just a collection of clans but a nation in its own right.  He said the results of the referendum also brought to an end the question of whether Somaliland should ever reunite with Somalia.  The president said his message to the international community was that Somaliland is worth doing business with. Somaliland broke away from Somalia at the start of the civil war 10 years ago, but is still unrecognized by the the international community.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service"
15,"Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said both countries had made enough progress to join the union.  But they will be checked for progress in curbing organised crime and corruption, and ensuring food safety and the proper use of EU funds.  Bulgaria's PM said the move was the fall of the Berlin Wall for his nation.  Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said his people should be proud of themselves, but should not make the mistake of thinking that accession would mean all the country's problems would be solved.  The conditions are tougher than those imposed on previous new members, observers say.  The BBC's Oana Lungescu in Strasbourg says they are intended both as a reassurance for EU citizens, only half of whom support further enlargement, and as a warning to Turkey and the Balkan nations still lobbying for EU membership.  The commission's report confirms that after seven years of talks, Bulgaria and Romania are able to take on the rights and obligations of EU membership.  Reading the report, Mr Barroso said the two nations' entry would be a ""historic achievement"".  ""Bulgaria and Romania have carried out an extraordinary reform process and they have gone through a remarkable transformation,"" he said.  The two countries missed out on the EU's big eastward expansion in 2004.  Correspondents say they will be delighted that they can get in on schedule before Mr Barroso puts a block on further expansion.  ""This is the genuine and final fall of the Berlin Wall for Bulgaria,"" said Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev.  But the commission president said there were a number of areas where further progress was needed in the months leading to accession and beyond.  Unless Bulgaria cracks down on organised crime, legal decisions taken by its courts could be disregarded in the rest of Europe.  Both countries will have to report every six months on progress in fighting corruption.  By March, they also need to set up agencies to handle millions of euros worth of EU farm aid, or risk losing a quarter of the cash.  Both will face food export bans due to outbreaks of animal diseases like swine fever, while Bulgarian planes could be banned from flying into EU airspace until the country improves its air safety standards.  There could also be restrictions on migration to other EU countries for up to three years.  An EU official said the commission did not want to punish Bulgaria and Romania, but to make them work harder to carry out reforms.  Mr Barroso said on Monday the EU could not go on with further expansion until it decided what to do about its stalled constitution.  The rules of the European club can currently cope to 27 members at most, though experts say they could be tinkered with to squeeze Croatia in before a major treaty change.  ""It would be unwise to bring in other member states apart from Romania and Bulgaria,"" he said on Monday.  ""There are some limits to our absorption capacity."""

The cleaner recently blew up in the middle of cleaning - but its makers Electrolux have given her a new model.  The only problem, Mrs Kingsland said, is the new model is too big and heavy.  After she married, she and her late husband Godfrey used the vacuum to clean their bed and breakfast and hotel.  Mrs Kingsland still does some of her own housework.  ""It's very quiet, very efficient - too heavy for me, and too big for my cupboard,"" she said."
17,"The modest ukulele is enjoying a surge in popularity. Once considered a novelty, the four-stringed instrument is ready to be taken seriously. In Spitalfields, where London's financial district borders the city's East End, stands the Duke of Uke, the only specialist ukulele shop in the UK. Dozens of brightly coloured ukuleles adorn its ceiling and walls. Shop owner Matt Reynolds explains how he first got the idea after his home became over run with his own ukulele collection. Uke ain't nothing but a hound dog - Elvis and four-stringed friend It seemed a good idea to start selling some of them off. Little did he realise that he would soon be riding the ukulele wave. ""In many ways they sell themselves,"" says Mr Reynolds. ""It's so portable and occupies not much space around you. It doesn't have the baggage associated with the guitar. It's very unintimidating, it just says hold me and play me."" After four years of steady growth Mr Reynolds has witnessed an even greater surge in interest - last Christmas sales were 30% higher than the previous year. And at least half of his customers are ""people who have never picked up an instrument before in their lives"". ""Customers used to come in and buy the cheapest ukulele now the average customer will come and spend up to £80 on a good instrument."" Sutherland Trading, one of the biggest distributors in the UK, was quick to respond to the public's renewed appetite for the stringed instrument. It now ships at least 3,000 ukuleles into the country every month. Alan Townsend who runs its ukulele division agrees that, ""undoubtedly there has been an astronomic rise,"" and claims that ""it has been the saviour of our industry."" He says that any shortfall in sales of instruments due to the economic downturn has been balanced by a rise in demand for the ukulele. Back at the Duke of Uke, Matt Reynolds is preparing for a group lesson. He says the magic of the uke is that with its four strings - as opposed to the guitar's six - it is easy to play. As a consequence, ""there are a lot of groups forming and running through songs together"". [The ukulele] is a strictly non-threatening musical instrument - not too difficult to play, easily portable and unpretentious    ""It's not long before you have a few chords down so that you can play a large amount of music that has been produced in the 20th Century"". ""Indie music has picked it up and in the aftermath of the digital age and back to acoustic feel there is a bigger interest in folk instruments and it happened to be one of them."" ""Then there is the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain who, in doing covers of songs, have really popularised the karaoke, sing-along aspect that is there."" So could the ukulele replace the recorder as first instrument of choice for schoolchildren ? Peter Hudson, a ukulele teacher for the Kitchen School of Music, says it continues to grow in popularity with primary schools and demand for lessons in secondary school. ""The ukulele is brilliant for kids to learn. It really comes to life when played in groups and they get a lot out of writing their own song. It would be great if everyone could learn the ukulele. It is a good way into any form of music."" The internet has helped fuel the popularity of the ukulele. Al Wood who runs a website for fans of the instrument, called Ukulele Hunt, says that two years ago he had 700 daily visitors and now there are almost 7,000 a day. There has been a huge increase in the amount of ukulele material online, says Mr Wood. And it's the instrument's online profile that helps explain its resurgence in popularity. Marilyn Monroe, George Formby, Pat Boone and the Two Ronnies (playing banjoleles) ""The internet has spread the idea of the ukulele as an accessible instrument. Whereas people take up the guitar aspiring to be like Jimi Hendrix, people watch a friend playing the ukulele on YouTube and think, 'I could do that'."" ""The big influences are people like Julia Nunes and Zee Avi who were making YouTube videos two years ago and are now touring the world and releasing albums."" Frank Skinner is one of a few British comedians sporting the ukulele, and he says he is ""completely hooked"". ""It's a strictly non-threatening musical instrument - not too difficult to play, easily portable and unpretentious,"" says Skinner. ""I also like that when I go into a music shop, there's about 5,000 guitar books and then three pamphlets on the ukulele. It feels like I'm operating on the outskirts of music. ""I love George Formby. That's the main reason I play. For me, he is the ukulele - amazing right hand. Consequently I see the uke as part of a British comic tradition. It sounds like it's laughing along."" Gerry Mawdsley, president of the George Formby Society, says membership is at its highest since the 1960s and increasing all the time. ""There has been a renaissance because you can play and sing at the same time. You don't need any musical knowledge at all."" Mr Mawdsley says that the ukulele will always be synonymous with Formby and is amazed by the amount of young people who still aspire to play his style. What would Formby make of all this? He would ""be over the moon that there was all this interest. He was loved by the people and he would love people playing his instrument."" Below is a selection of your comments on the story Im buying one!! (to add to my collection of other totally useless stuff I never get round to using).  Ben Skinner, Leeds My wife gave me a lime green glittery ukulele for Christmas, and may have regretted it as I didn't put it down for a week! I've been playing electric guitar in bands for years and would love to do a little ukulele section at gigs, but the drummer would have a fit.  Darren, Dursley I am an ex-pro musician & music teacher of some 50+ years playing experience. I disagree with the comments relating to George Formby. With his 'Village Idiot' persona, he left a legacy which perceived the Ukulele as being merely a prop for similar style comedians. Formby was a self confessed musical Philistine, and whilst I agree that the ukulele is extremely accessible, it is not strictly true that that you can play it ""without any musical knowledge at all"" yet Mr. Maudsley seems quite happy to perpetrate the idea that any idiot can do it! This association of the ukulele with Formby caused player like myself such embarrassment that serious musicians were forced to hide their talent in the 'closet'! Luckily the younger generation, oblivious of Formby, have thrown themselves into a much wider range of music, which as well as adding to the growing eclectic ukulele trend, have enabled us old fogies to emerge from the closet to once more enjoy the original ukulele music of the Jazz era without someone shouting ""turned out nice again""!How refreshing.   Stan Gee, Redcar, Cleveland, England Every time I see anything about ukes. I think back to a very young summer living in Waikiki in a studio with shutters, no windows. My neighbour who I never saw played the ukulele like an angel all the time. What a summer that was.  Stephanie Curtis, San Francisco, CA I have often visited the Duke of Uke, and love trying the different ukes. I purchased a Kala tenor from there and it changed my life. Just love it!!

18,"Earlier this month, an elderly homeless woman died in a crowded Hong Kong McDonald's restaurant. No-one noticed her for seven hours. The BBC's Juliana Liu spent a night in one 24-hour restaurant to meet the people the city has dubbed ""McRefugees"".  On a major road in the working class neighbourhood of Sham Shui Po, a pair of bright yellow arches beckons visitors into a 24-hour McDonald's outlet.  Spread out over two floors, it is spacious by Hong Kong standards.  As night falls, the fast-food restaurant becomes a temporary hostel, attracting dozens of the city's poorest people.  Although similar crowds can be found at McDonald's outlets all over Asia - especially in Japan and mainland China - an aging population, unaffordable property prices and stagnant wages all conspire to make the problem particularly acute in Hong Kong.  Here, it is a vibrant community of regulars, many of them elderly, whose cheerful smiles mask desperately sad stories of personal misfortune.  The unofficial leader of the group is Ah Chan, 54, a well-spoken former police officer.  He says he rents a tiny room nearby, but spends most of his evenings at McDonald's, where he can while away the hours in comfort chatting with friends.  ""This is a familiar place, with familiar faces,"" he tells me in fluent English. ""These people are all wanderers. Some come for a short while, others a long time. Most of them don't have a home. They have nowhere else to go.""  Hong Kong is one of the world's most unequal places in terms of wealth distribution. About one in five of the territory's seven million people live in poverty, according to government figures.  Among the elderly, one in three lives below the poverty line.  At a recent conference on the subject, officials said the best way to tackle poverty was to expand the economy and create jobs.  But this strategy is unlikely to help Mr Chan. Over a paper cup of tap water, he explains his own slide into downward mobility.  After university in the late 1970s, he joined the police department, leaving in 1996 to start a business investing in mainland China.  Over the next seven years, he poured most of his savings, and money from his relatives, into the company. But in 2003, his mainland Chinese partners ran away with the money, he said.  After three years of legal battles, he returned to Hong Kong in 2006, broke and exhausted.  ""What happened in China defeated my mind,"" he says. ""I had to take a rest to ease my mind. I'm trying to face what's in front of me. Sometimes, I feel very tough. Other times, the bad memories will influence me.""  Mr Chan says he rarely sees his relatives: ""I can't face them. They trusted me, and I let them down. I can't say I had no responsibility for what happened.""  He does casual jobs to make spending money. He also frequents food banks and wears donated clothing.  The view from the other side of the lens  Indian photographer Suraj Katra began photographing Hong Kong's ""McRefugees"" in 2013, beginning a project to document what he called a ""social phenomenon"".  ""As a photographer, I found it so ironic that you have such colourful ambience in the background and then these old homeless or poor people in the foreground. I snapped a few photos on my phone.  ""I always looked at McDonald's as amazing value in a place like Hong Kong. You get cheap food, good lighting, good air conditioning, good seating and good service. I thought I should document the people who were really making the most of this.  ""I come from a much poorer country, India. For me, when I look at these people, I still think they are well-off compared with the homeless in a place like India. It's more organised. At least there is some welfare and a place to sleep.""  As we chat, well after midnight, two elderly people snore loudly on the immediate benches near us.  A staff member comes over to explain that someone has locked himself into the bathroom, but otherwise leaves us alone.  In a statement later, McDonalds said it ""welcome all walks of life to visit our restaurants any time"". It expressed sadness over the recent death, and said it balanced being ""more accommodating and caring"" to people staying there overnight with ensuring a good experience for all customers.  By this time of night, all the paying patrons have left. Only the ""McRefugees"" are left.  One of them is David Ho, 66, who until last year worked as a security guard on a monthly salary of HK$10,000 ($1,300; £840). But he suffered a stroke, rendering him unable to work.  He survives on a daily cocktail of medicines, which he gets from a public hospital, and a monthly government welfare payment of HK$3,870.  ""You must think I am very lazy. But I am not. I want to work. But I can't find a job at my age. That is why I am taking money from the government,"" he says.  Even with welfare, Mr Ho cannot afford to live in Hong Kong, which has some of the most expensive property in the world.  The city does provide public housing, but there is a shortage of units and the waiting list is years long.  So, he rents a room across the border in Shenzhen for 1,000 yuan (HK$1,222; $157; £103) a month.  Mr Ho misses Hong Kong, so he travels on the train to the Sham Shui Po McDonalds once a week or so, staying for a few days at a time.  As we chat, a steady stream of people continue to arrive, well into the morning hours.  A middle-aged man comes in and sits down just behind us. He listens intently and repeats, parrot-like, everything we say.  By this time, the lights on the second floor, where we have been gathering, are lowered.  Nearly everyone has gone to sleep."
19,"When the song about delirious dancing Cockneys became a hit in the pre-war musical Me and My Girl, the street of the same name was in its heyday, lined with shops and market stalls.  But thanks to a process begun by World War II bombers and completed by urban planners, there are just a handful of shops left and the famous Lambeth Walk street market has all but died.  ""I'm a bit ashamed that when any visitors come down to Lambeth Walk, they see that... it's terrible,"" said 76-year-old Bert Vincent, landlord of the Royal Oak pub.  In 1938, 159 shops lined the street and catered for every need, including 11 butchers, two eel and pie shops (one with a tank of live eels outside), a bird dealer and a tripe dresser.  Lil Brown, now 86, worked on a Saturday stall when she was 12 selling stockings, and also helped her aunt make toffee apples in her basement.  ""We used to put the sticks in the apples for her,"" Mrs Brown told BBC News Online.  ""Then she used to take them up to the stall in a great big bowl. Apart from the toffee apples, they used to sell sweets like coconut ice and treacle toffee. But that was when it was really a busy market - it was a well-known market.""  The market kept running during World War II - although the street's location, less than a mile from the Houses of Parliament, meant the area suffered from stray bombs.  If an air raid siren sounded when the market was on, stall-holders would simply abandon their goods and head for the nearest shelter, Mrs Brown said.  Most shops escaped destruction, but one direct hit came when a landmine landed on Boots the chemist, remembers Mrs Brown, who was visiting her sister nearby at the time.  ""When the warning went, we shot underneath the table and I got covered in soot because the landmine was only a matter of yards away. That was a bad experience,"" she said.  ""In those days, we had fires and people didn't have their chimneys swept. So if you get a loud explosion near there, down come the soot. The windows came out and everything.""  Another landmine hit a school just off the Walk, killing five people in the house of Mr Vincent's wife Connie, who was then aged 10.  The ""massive"" lady could not fit through the manhole cover leading to the shelter, and a fire three days earlier had blocked her only other access. So when the landmine hit, setting the school alight and causing a gas explosion, she and four others were still in the house.  The war marked the beginning of the end for the street as a commercial and social centre, according to George Wilkins, 72, who has run a photography shop there since 1965.  ""It never was as good after the war because it had suffered quite a bit,"" he said.  When he opened his shop, there were still 99 others on the Walk - but then a series of redevelopments began which drove most of the shops out.  By 1980, 23 shops and just six regular market stalls were left. Today, half the ""new"" precinct has already been pulled down to make way for modern flats, and half the shops in the remaining units are permanently shuttered up.  The only remaining Victorian shop buildings on the street have been renovated and occupied - but by firms like architects that are not open to the public.  And locals, scarred by doomed developments and afraid the council simply wants to sell some of the most potentially lucrative land in London, are highly sceptical about any new plans."

""I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed,"" said Gen McChrystal of Bin Laden. ""I believe he is an iconic figure at this point, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organisation across the world."" The general said that killing or capturing Bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but that the movement could not be eradicated while Bin Laden remained at large. The militant leader is believed to be living in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates said last week that officials have had no reliable information on Bin Laden's whereabouts for ""years"". Gen McChrystal told the Congressional hearing the next 18 months would be crucial in Afghanistan, but that he did not expect to need more troops to get the job done. He said coalition forces faced ""a complex and resilient insurgency"" and that Afghans lacked confidence in their government. ""Success will require steadfast commitment and incur significant costs,"" he told the House Armed Services Committee. It is said the general only takes one meal a day so maybe he used the lunch hour to reflect that his worries are not the same as those on the Hill who worry more about perceptions of weakness.    The commander said the 30,000 US reinforcements would ""provide us the ability to reverse insurgent momentum and deny the Taliban the access to the population they require to survive"". He said he did not think he would need to ask for any more troops in a year's time, but would not hesitate to recommend more if circumstances changed. The US ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, who questioned the troop build-up during White House deliberations last month, also endorsed the new approach as ""the best path to stabilise Afghanistan"". Mr Eikenberry agreed with Gen McChrystal that Bin Laden was key to that process. He said it was ""important to the American people - indeed, the people of the world - that one day Osama Bin Laden is either captured or killed, brought to justice"". The new battle plan includes an 18-month timeline before the first US troops would begin to come home. Hours before the panel convened, Mr Gates held talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the capital, Kabul. Speaking at a joint news conference afterwards, President Karzai warned that it would take 15 years before Afghanistan was able to pay for the cost of its own security forces, which the US wants to quadruple in size to 400,000 troops by 2013. ""We hope that the international community and the United States, as our first ally, will help Afghanistan reach the ability to sustain a force,"" he said. For his part, Mr Karzai said he hoped the US and the international community would continue funding them, adding the US would not abandon Afghanistan. The two countries would need to be long-term partners, he said. The defence secretary said Mr Karzai needed to take a tougher line on corruption, but added that many ministers were competent and did not need to be replaced when a new cabinet is announced in the coming days. Mr Karzai said he was committed to doing so and that he would inform parliament of the names of a number of proposed ministers. Both men then agreed that it was a priority to strengthen the Afghan security forces in order to help international troops tackle insurgents. But Mr Karzai was also cautiously optimistic that his country would be able to begin taking over responsibility for security in some ""critical"" parts of the country within two years, before taking charge nationwide in five years' time. The president later condemned what his office said was the killing of six civilians in an overnight operation by Nato-led forces in the eastern province of Laghman. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Residents have protested against the reported civilian deaths, which they and provincial officials say number 12. The Nato-led International Security Assistance Force said its troops killed seven militants and detained another four after coming under hostile fire while pursuing a member of the Taliban responsible for suicide bombings in the area. Meanwhile, in a sign of the country's security difficulties, there were reports on Tuesday that Afghan officers had opened fire during a protest by villagers over the deaths of civilians, which they say occurred during a Nato operation. According to one report, the Afghan soldiers fired into the air, but at least one person was killed.     "
21,"Burger giant McDonald's has reported its first ever quarterly loss after it was hit by the costs of closing hundreds of its restaurants  The world's largest restaurant chain posted a net loss of $344m (£212m) for the October to December period, compared with a profit of $272m the year before.  It took a whopping $810m charge to cover job cuts, the exit from three Latin American markets and to pay for the closure of more than 700 restaurants, mainly in its two largest markets, Japan and the US.  McDonald's, which runs some 30,000 restaurants worldwide, has suffered from slow sales growth in the US, its largest market.  The American fast-food market has become increasingly competitive as rivals such as Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell fight to maintain their market share.  McDonald's revenues for the quarter were up 2% at $3.9bn, but margins have been under pressure since the introduction of McDonald's 'Dollar Menu' which triggered a price war with rival Burger King.  In his first address to Wall Street last week, chief executive Jim Cantalupo said McDonald's would stick to the Dollar Menu although it could be adjusted.  He added that McDonald's would close more restaurants in the US and Japan this year.  The fourth-quarter net loss marks the eighth quarter of the past nine in which the burger giant's results have failed to live up to its year-earlier level.  Shares of McDonald's fell nearly 14% in the fourth quarter, while the Dow Jones edged up nearly 5% over that same period.  Investors were not impressed with the latest update, and the stock fell 43 cents to $14.93 in early New York trading on Thursday."
22,"Some Labour MPs, constituency parties and unions are set to appeal to the party to reinstate the motions that were due for discussion next week.  It is understood some 96 of 120 contemporary motions were ruled out by the Conference Arrangements Committee.  Labour says some of the motions do not meet a specified criteria.  Labour MP Austin Mitchell said it was ""crazy"" that motions on housing had been ruled out of order when the issue was so topical.  He has written to union general secretaries calling on them to make a case for the reinstatement of many of the contemporary motions, that are submitted by constituency parties and the unions.  Some motions ruled out of order called for support of the so-called ""fourth option"" of allowing local authorities to build more council housing, which Mr Mitchell claimed had the support of many rank and file party members.  Labour MP John McDonnell, who failed to gain enough support to challenge Mr Brown to succeed Tony Blair, said: ""This closing down of debate within the Labour Party by Brown's imposition of such centralised control is cutting him off from the debates of party members and the concerns of the population at large.  ""If Labour Party members are denied a say in this way, they will increasingly be asking: what is the point of going to conference or even of being a party member?""  A number of party activists said the ruling out of so many motions showed the party's ""control-freakery"" was still present.  But a Labour spokesman said it was not unusual for a number of contemporary motions to be ruled out of order.  ""There is a criteria for what contemporary motions are. It is true that a lot did not meet that criteria,"" he said.  He added that there were still motions on housing on the agenda.  On Tuesday, Labour's ruling body, the NEC, also agreed a package of reforms that will water down union power at Labour's conference.  Gordon Brown's plans to scrap the ""contemporary resolutions"" often used by the unions to inflict policy defeats on the party leadership were accepted by 23 votes to four.  From 2008, this will no longer be possible, but the unions received a major concession in that the process will be reviewed after two years.  Tony Blair suffered a number of defeats in recent years when contemporary resolutions put forward by trade unions were backed by delegates."
23,"But increasingly game makers want their creations to match the real world in one crucial respect. Namely the physics used to underpin the action, reaction and interaction of every element in the game world.  Not long ago games action was notoriously uniform. Fire a rocket and the resulting explosion would look the same every time. The scenery may not even be damaged.  But better physics means you can let the computer work out what happens when rockets are fired at zombies, bunnies or rebounding surfaces. It will be different every time.  The physics in ground-breaking games such as Half-Life 2 and Doom III is only the beginning.  Limits on the processing power and computer memory available to game makers means that only relatively large rigid bodies were modelled effectively in these recent titles.  This means that you get a good idea of what happens when grenades meet packing crates or circular saw blades interact with zombies. What you get is everything splitting or shattering into relatively large chunks.  It does mean that it is hard to model the interaction of anything smaller than those chunks or such things as liquids.  But even this offers a huge range of possibilities so much so that in Half-Life 2 players get a gravity gun that lets them take advantage of the realistic action/reaction and interaction of objects. Many of the puzzles in the game that held up the progress of its central character Gordon Freeman revolved around exploiting physics.  David O'Meara, chief executive of physics software firm Havok, said Half-Life 2 offers a hint of what is to come.  ""Half-Life 2 is the standard now in terms of what the consumers sees,"" he said. ""But it was developed over a number of years and the standard of physics today is not what the consumer sees.""  Already there are games that can model interactions using elements as small as bullets and realistically show what happens when they hit a foot or ankle, said Mr O'Meara.  The next big change is modelling interactions between objects and environments made of particles - effectively big molecules.  This will give game designers unprecedented freedom to build worlds and have the objects, animals and people in them react to each other like their real world equivalents.  The next generation of consoles and powerful desktop PCs will give designers the scope to model entire worlds of such small elements, said Mr O'Meara, although there were going to be moments when other things, such as animation of faces have prior calls on memory and processing power.  There are also more firms producing physics engines, such as Ageia, Meqon and others, that developers can use to give games a more realistic feel.  ""There are games coming out where we know what's been achieved and it is at least as startling as what has been seen in Half-Life 2,"" he said.  Better physics is not just restricted to consoles and PCs. Mobile phones are getting their own physics engines too.  As its name implies the game gives the player to chance to emulate the antics and tricks of Motocross superstar Nate Adams.  Though it features only a bike, rider and a variety of hilly courses the game is surprisingly challenging, thanks to physics, said Darren Hedges, an I-Play developer who helped put the title together.  Key presses control how far forward and back the in-game Nate leans which radically changes the way the bike reacts.  ""In a normal sprite-based system if a bike was to crash into the ground at a series of intervals it would always look the same,"" he said.  ""But good physics means that Nate comes off his bike a myriad of different ways with a myriad number of results,"" said Mr Hedges.  ""It allows us to have bike and rider as two separate entities and that allows the user to be punished for making mistakes,"" he said.  ""We don't want the game punishing the user,"" he said. ""We want the user punishing the user."""
24,"France has told its nationals to leave Ivory Coast, as hundreds of stone-throwing youths block the airport in the commercial capital, Abidjan.  Up to 1,500 French nationals are trapped in the airport by supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo.  French troops have intervened and one soldier was injured in the face by a stone.  Mr Gbagbo's supporters accuse former colonial power France of forcing him to share power with rebels at peace talks held in Paris last week.  The man named in the peace deal as the new prime minister, Seydou Elimane Diarra, was due to arrive in Abidjan on Friday to start forming a new government.  He was in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, where West African leaders were discussing the Ivory Coast crisis.  ""Diarra is the prime minister of the French,"" shouted the protesters, as they burnt the French flag.  They taunted the French families trying to leave, telling them not to return.  Some 16,000 French nationals are resident in Ivory Coast and some large companies earlier this week chartered planes to fly out the families of their staff.  ""We advise those French nationals whose presence in Ivory Coast is not essential to leave the country,"" said French foreign ministry spokesman Francois Rivasseau.  French security forces, later helped by their Ivorian colleagues, cleared the demonstrators from the runway but they then reassembled outside the airport entrance.  French tanks stopped them from re-entering the terminal building.  A plane from French company Air Liberte finally took off around 1200 local time (1100 GMT).  Ivorian Defence Minister Bertin Kadet went to the airport to calm the protesters and he said the French action had inflamed the situation.  ""I spoke to the French troops, I asked them to leave the area to avoid further demonstrations,"" he said.  ""I think there are situations which we can avoid by working together.""  Some 2,500 French troops are monitoring a ceasefire line across the middle of the country.  They were originally sent to protect French and other western nationals in Ivory Coast.  Some observers fear that if the French troops are switched to evacuate their nationals, Ivory Coast will return to full-scale war.  After the deal was signed last weekend, Mr Gbagbo's supporters staged four days of anti-French protests.  Rebels say they have been promised the defence and interior ministries but this does not appear in the official text.  The army has said it will refuse to serve under a rebel defence minister.  Mr Gbagbo has not yet delivered his address to the nation, in which he has promised to explain why he agreed to the controversial deal.  The BBC's Tom McKinley in Abidjan says that without the support of the army and the main Ivory Coast political parties, the president has little choice but to break his promise and reject the plan for reconciliation.  He says his only chance of carrying it though would be if the rebels dropped their demand for the defence and interior ministries.  The conflict has split the world's largest cocoa producer along ethnic and religious lines.  The rebels control the largely Muslim north, while the mainly Christian south, including Abidjan, remains in government hands."
25,"Cameras will once again follow the eccentric life of Ozzy Osbourne and his family as a second series of his reality show has been confirmed.  The new series of the highly successful reality TV show will be twice as long as the first, after Osbourne and his family agreed a new deal with MTV.  It follows the home life of the rocker and his family and has given music station MTV its biggest ratings in both the US and UK.  The show has been a massive success thanks to the eccentric antics of the Osbournes, and has resurrected Ozzy's career.  There had already been talk of a second series but rumours of seven-figure demands looked like spelling the end.  But a second series will start filming soon, with 20 episodes going out in the US in the autumn.  Only the first two episodes have been screened in the UK so far but viewers will be able to see the follow-up shortly after it airs in America.  It will once again follow the day-to-day lives of Osbourne, his wife and manager Sharon, and children Jack and Kelly.  The MTV crew and its 55 cameras will follow the Osbournes around 24 hours a day as they relax at home or hit the road on tour.  The increasing popularity will ensure Osbourne will be busy over the coming months, promising more of his erratic behaviour.  As well as the family there is a whole host of other ""characters"" including pets, assistants, roadies and the neighbours.  ""We are truly overwhelmed by the incredible response to the show. We never expected that by inviting MTV into our home, we'd get such a positive reaction from fans young and old,"" said Sharon Osbourne.  The show regularly reached an audience of six million viewers in the US and 500,000 in the UK - an impressive number for the cable channel.  Osbourne, the former frontman for Black Sabbath, recently returned to his British roots as he appeared at his Ozzfest festival at Donington Park in Leicestershire.  Channel 4, ITV and Channel 5 are all understood to be keen to show the programme to a mass audience after its exposure to cable and satellite viewers."
26,"In few other countries did the Roman Catholic Church play such a prominent role in the struggle for nationhood as in East Timor.  The government has declared three days of national mourning to mark the death of Pope John Paul II.  His visit to East Timor in 1989 was a catalyst which encouraged those fighting for independence to seek greater international support.  During the 24 years of Indonesian occupation nuns and priests, led by Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, risked their lives to try to protect the mainly Roman Catholic population from military abuses.  Bishop Belo's outspoken condemnation of human rights abuses in the territory earned him a shared Nobel Peace Prize in 1996.  In 1989 East Timor had been hidden from view for 14 years, completely sealed off by an Indonesian occupation which had reportedly cost the lives of one-third of its population.  A planned visit by the Pope that year was controversial.  The Vatican prized its cordial relations with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, but with a sizable minority of Roman Catholics.  Indonesia would not tolerate any suggestion that its rule in East Timor was not legitimate.  It insisted Pope John Paul II hold mass in a natural arena under the mountains outside Dili where a number of atrocities were thought to have taken place.  But the evidence of extensive human rights abuses, and the anguished protests of Bishop Belo, demanded some show of solidarity from the Pope.  On arriving in Dili he kissed a cross, with which he then touched the ground, rather than kissing the ground itself as was his custom, to avoid suggesting East Timor was a sovereign country.  He spoke out strongly against all abuses, without specifying his Indonesian hosts, but making it clear enough to the tens of thousands who had come to hear him whom he had in mind.  In front of the world's cameras for the first time, young Timorese scuffled and then fought with the Indonesian security forces, the outside world's first view of a civil disobedience movement which would continue until the referendum which eventually won East Timor its independence in 1999.  At key moments the Vatican backed its priests and bishops, while always professing neutrality on the issue of independence.  Bishop Belo was in many ways like the Pope: politically and morally conservative, but outraged by the cruelty and repression he witnessed.  His outbursts got him into trouble with the Indonesian government, which put pressure on the Vatican to replace him.  The Vatican refused. I can vividly remember the extraordinary day in 1996 when the Indonesian ruler Suharto made his first visit to East Timor in eight years.  He had to meet Bishop Belo, who through unlucky timing for Indonesia had just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  But the Vatican Ambassador to Jakarta ushered him out to meet us, and stood smiling behind him, as Bishop Belo said how strange it was that he was the first Indonesian citizen to win the Nobel Prize.  Yet the president had not even mentioned it, let alone congratulated him.  The church in East Timor was after all an extraordinary success story for the Vatican - at the time of the Indonesian invasion only 20% of its people called themselves Roman Catholics, a faith they associated with Portuguese colonial rule.  Ten years later that figure had risen to 95%.  With nowhere else to turn to, people sought refuge in the church.  Some of the clergy directly helped the armed resistance movement in the mountains.  Pope John Paul II would have been uncomfortable with this overtly political role, but he did nothing to stop it.  A number of priests and nuns paid with their lives when pro-Indonesian militias rampaged through East Timor after the referendum, but as a result the standing of the church at independence had never been higher.  Ironically now that the struggle is over, church attendance is dwindling, as younger Timorese lose interest and the church's protective role is no longer needed."
27,"A bridegroom has admitted starting a £6m fire at a Cheshire castle where his wedding reception was being held.  Max Kay, 36, of Liverpool, started the blaze at Peckforton Castle Hotel in Tarporley at 05:00 BST on 19 June.  At Chester Crown Court, he admitted arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered.  But he denied a count of arson with intent to destroy or damage property and to endanger life. This was accepted by the prosecution.  One hundred firefighters tackled the blaze at the Grade I-listed 19th Century country house, built in the style of a castle.  Almost 200 people, including 11 children, had to be evacuated.  A previous hearing heard that Kay, of Waylands Drive in Hunts Cross, and his wife had rowed with staff and the owners of the castle earlier in the day over the late payment for the wedding and then again later in the evening about a bar bill.  The court was told that Kay, who was said to have drunk a large amount of vodka that day, continued to complain to staff about the owners.  He then left the final group of revellers who were drinking into the early hours.  He was seen on CCTV going into and coming out of the drawing room, which was set up for the following day's wedding.  Fire investigators later discovered the blaze had been started when curtains in that room were set alight.  At Friday's hearing, Judge Roger Dutton granted the father of two bail but warned him a custodial sentence was ""inevitable"".  Duncan Bould, prosecuting, told the court the fire had caused ""in the region"" of £6m in damage.  He said: ""There were a large number of guests staying that night.  ""Fortunately, and it is good fortune, the premises was equipped with a very efficient fire alarm and the combination of that and the staff meant that all the guests were able to be evacuated.""  Mr Bould said many of the guests were from Kay's own wedding party who had ""taken alcohol to some extent or another"" and were ""obviously vulnerable"".  Patrick Thompson, defending, said the offence came at a time when the defendant was under ""great personal strain"" and he was ""near bankrupt""."
28,"The move will clear the country's obligations to the Washington-based lender two years ahead of schedule.  The Brazilian government said the early repayment reflected the improving performance of the country's economy.  It marks an economic turnaround for Brazil, which obtained IMF loans in 2002 to avoid defaulting on its debts.  Finance Minister Antonio Palocci said Brazil would fund the early repayment of its IMF debt from its reserves, which have swelled to $66.7bn from just $15bn two years ago.  ""The repayment will save more than $900m in interest costs,"" Mr Palocci said.  Brazil had been expected to repay $7.03bn to the IMF in 2006 and $8.43bn in 2007, the Finance Ministry said.  ""This decision reflects the growing strength of Brazil's external position, especially continuing substantial trade and current account surpluses and strong capital inflows that have greatly boosted reserves and reduced external debt,"" Mr Rato said.  Brazil's decision to repay its IMF debts by the end of December comes as the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva struggles to deal with a number of corruption scandals.  The president's chief of staff Jose Dirceu was expelled from the country's Congress at the beginning of the month, following allegations he masterminded a scheme under which the governing Workers Party allegedly paid bribes to its congressional allies for votes."
29,"Slaves were owned in all Islamic societies, both sedentary and nomadic, ranging from Arabia in the centre to North Africa in the west and to what is now Pakistan and Indonesia in the east. Some Islamic states, such as the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean Khanate, and the Sokoto caliphate [Nigeria], must be termed slave societies because slaves there were very important numerically as well as a focus of the polities' energies. Many societies throughout history have practised slavery, and Muslim societies were no exception. It's thought that as many people were enslaved in the Eastern slave trade as in the Atlantic slave trade. It's ironic that when the Atlantic slave trade was abolished the Eastern trade expanded, suggesting that for some Africans the abolition of the Atlantic trade didn't lead to freedom, but merely changed their slave destination. It's misleading to use phrases such as 'Islamic slavery' and 'Muslim slave trade', even though slavery existed in many Muslim cultures at various times, since the Atlantic slave trade is not called the Christian slave trade, even though most of those responsible for it were Christians. Slavery was common in pre-Islamic times and accepted by many ancient legal systems and it continued under Islam. Although Islam is much credited for moderating the age-old institution of slavery, which was also accepted and endorsed by the other monotheistic religions, Christianity and Judaism, and was a well-established custom of the pre-Islamic world, it has never preached the abolition of slavery as a doctrine. The condition of slaves, like that of women, may well have improved with the coming of Islam, but the institution was not abolished, any more than it was under Christianity at this period. Islam's approach to slavery added the idea that freedom was the natural state of affairs for human beings and in line with this it limited the opportunities to enslave people, commended the freeing of slaves and regulated the way slaves were treated: Islam greatly limited those who could be enslaved and under what circumstances (although these restrictions were often evaded) Islam treated slaves as human beings as well as property Islam banned the mistreatment of slaves - indeed the tradition repeatedly stresses the importance of treating slaves with kindness and compassion Islam allowed slaves to achieve their freedom and made freeing slaves a virtuous act But the essential nature of slavery remained the same under Islam, as elsewhere. It involved serious breaches of human rights and however well they were treated, the slaves still had restricted freedom; and, when the law was not obeyed, their lives could be very unpleasant. A poignant paradox of Islamic slavery is that the humanity of the various rules and customs that led to the freeing of slaves created a demand for new slaves that could only be supplied by war, forcing people into slavery or trading slaves. The legality of slavery in Islam, together with the example of the Prophet Muhammad, who himself bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves, may explain why slavery persisted until the 19th century in many places (and later still in some countries). The impetus for the abolition of slavery came largely from colonial powers, although some Muslim thinkers argued strongly for abolition. Slaves came from many places Unlike the Atlantic slave traders, Muslims enslaved people from many cultures as well as Africa. Other sources included the Balkans, Central Asia and Mediterranean Europe. Slaves could be assimilated into Muslim society Muhammad's teaching that slaves were to be regarded as human beings with dignity and rights and not just as property, and that freeing slaves was a virtuous thing to do, may have helped to create a culture in which slaves became much more assimilated into the community than they were in the West. Slaves in the Islamic world were not always at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Slaves in Muslim societies had a greater range of work, and took on a wider range of responsibilities, than those enslaved in the Atlantic trade. Some slaves earned respectable incomes and achieved considerable power, although even such elite slaves still remained in the power of their owners. Muslim slavery was not just economic Unlike the Western slave trade, slavery in Islam was not wholly motivated by economics. Although some Muslim slaves were used as productive labour it was not generally on the same mass scale as in the West but in smaller agricultural enterprises, workshops, building, mining and transport. Slaves were also taken for military service, some serving in elite corps essential to the ruler's control of the state, while others joined the equivalent of the civil service. Another category of slavery was sexual slavery in which young women were made concubines, either on a small scale or in large harems of the powerful. Some of these women were able to achieve wealth and power. These harems might be guarded by eunuchs, men who had been enslaved and castrated. Where did the slaves come from? Muslim traders took their slaves from three main areas: Non-Muslim Africa, in particular the Horn While Islamic law does allow slavery under certain conditions, it's almost inconceivable that those conditions could ever occur in today's world, and so slavery is effectively illegal in modern Islam. Muslim countries also use secular law to prohibit slavery. News stories do continue to report occasional instances of slavery in a few Muslim countries, but these are usually denied by the authorities concerned. In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed. Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions  Islamic law and custom provided no basis for the abolition of slavery or even for the curtailment of the slave trade. Bernard Lewis, The Shaping of the Modern Middle East, 1994 Although the vast majority of contemporary Muslims abhor slavery, it remains part of their religious law. Islamic sharia law accepted (and accepts) slavery, as did other legal systems of ancient times such as Roman law, Hebrew law, Byzantine Christian law, African customary law and Hindu law. The world was very different in those days, and practices that seem profoundly unethical to modern minds were common and accepted. During the formative stages of shari'a (and for the next millennium at least) there was no conception of universal human rights anywhere in the world. Slavery was an established and lawful institution in many parts of the world throughout this period... Slavery was too fundamental to the structure of Arabian society in the 7th century to be abolished easily. Doing so would have estranged many of the tribes that Muhammad sought to bring together, and severely disrupted the working of society. Prohibiting slavery in the context of seventh-century Arabia apparently would have been as useful as prohibiting poverty; it would have reflected a noble ideal but would have been unworkable on an immediate basis without establishing an entirely new socioeconomic system. But this was a problem, since Islam placed a high value on human dignity and freedom. The fact that slavery is a major concern in Islamic law no doubt stems from the prevalence of slavery at the time when Islam was instituted combined with the fact that the Qur'an clearly presents universal freedom and human dignity as its ideal society. Its recommendation that slaves be freed is on the same plane as its recommendation that the poor be clothed and the hungry be fed. So the early Muslims restricted and regulated slavery to remove some of its cruelties, but accepted that it was legal. ... The most that shari'a could do, and did in fact do, in that historical context was to modify and lighten the harsh consequences of slavery and discrimination on grounds of religion or gender... Shari'a recognized slavery as an institution but sought to restrict the sources of acquisition of slaves, to improve their condition, and to encourage their emancipation through a variety of religious and civil methods. Nevertheless, slavery is lawful under shari'a to the present day. Is slavery still legal in Islam? The answer is that slavery is legal under Islamic law but only in theory. Slavery is illegal under the state law of all Muslim countries. Theoretically Islamic law lays down that if a person was captured in a lawful jihad or was the descendent of an unbroken chain of people who had been lawfully enslaved, then it might be legal to enslave them. Nonetheless, should the legal condition for the enslavement of anyone be proven (because he had been taken prisoner fighting against Islam with a view to its extirpation and persisted in invincible ignorance in his sacrilegious and infidel convictions, or because there did exist legal proof that all his ancestors without exception had been slaves descended from a person taken prisoner conducting a warfare of such invincible ignorance) Islam would be bound to recognize such slavery as legal, even though recommending the freeing of the person and if possible his conversion, in this modern age. Tabandeh, Muslim Commentary on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, quoted in 'Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shari'a and Basic Human Rights Concerns, in Liberal Islam, ed Charles Kurzman, 1998 In practice, it seems virtually impossible that there will ever again be a jihad that is lawfully declared according to the strict letter of the law, and there are no living descendants of lawful slaves, which means that legal enslavement is unthinkable. Islamic law recognises slavery as an institution within society, and attempts to regulate and restrict it in various ways. Different Islamic legal schools differ in their interpretation of Islamic law on slavery. Local customs in Muslim lands also affected the way slaves were treated. In the merchant cities of South-East Asia the sharia helped forge a legal distinction between slave and non-slave unknown in the rural hinterland. More frequently, however, the application of the sharia outside the Middle East was tempered by local customs. This allowed Muslims in regions as distant as Somalia, India and Indonesia to argue for the maintenance of pre-Islamic and other local structures of slavery even if these ran counter to the prescriptions of the sharia. Gwyn Campbell; Frank Cass, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 2004 Islamic law clearly recognises that slaves are human beings, but it frequently treats slaves as if they are property, laying down regulations covering the buying and selling of slaves. It encourages the freeing of slaves, which has the good effect of diminishing the slave population of a culture and, paradoxically, the bad effect of encouraging those whose livelihood depends on slave labour to find new ways of acquiring slaves. Who can be enslaved Under Islamic law people can only be legally enslaved in two circumstances: as the result of being defeated in a war that was legal according to sharia if they are born as the child of two slave parents Other legal systems of the time allowed people to be enslaved in a far wider range of circumstances. The sharia limits were often either ignored or evaded, and many instances of slave trading by Muslims were in fact illegal, but tolerated. The following groups of people cannot be made slaves: Free Muslims, but note that: Slaves who convert to Islam are not automatically freed Children born to legally enslaved Muslims are also slaves Slaves must not be mistreated or overworked, but should be treated well Slaves may take legal action for a breach of these rules, and may be freed as a result Slaves can get married if their owner consents Slaves may undertake business on the owner's behalf Slaves guilty of crimes can only be given half the punishment that would be given to a non-slave (although some schools of Islamic law do allow the execution of a slave who commits murder) A female slave cannot be separated from her child while it is under 7 years old Female slaves cannot be forced into prostitution Islamic law allows slaves to get their freedom under certain circumstances. It divides slaves with the right to freedom into various classes: The mukatab: a slave who has the contractual right to buy their freedom over time The mudabbar: a slave who will be freed when their owner dies (this might not happen if the owner's estate was too small) The umm walid, a female slave who had borne her owner a child Owners are allowed to have sex with their female slaves Slaves cannot carry out some religious roles Slaves can have only limited authority Slaves cannot be witnesses in court Killing a slave does not carry the death penalty in most schools of Islamic law Slaves are punishable under Islamic law if they commit a crime - although for some major crimes they only receive half the punishment of free people  The Prophet Muhammad did not try to abolish slavery, and bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves himself. But he insisted that slave owners treat their slaves well and stressed the virtue of freeing slaves. There are two different ways of interpreting this: some modern writers believe that Muhammad intended his teachings to lead to the gradual end of slavery by limiting opportunities to acquire new slaves and allowing existing slaves to become free. This idea doesn't appear in early writings. others writers argue that by regulating slavery the Prophet gave his authority to its continued existence, and that by having slaves himself he showed his approval Muhammad treated slaves as human beings and clearly held some in the highest esteem. For example, he personally ensured the freedom of Bilal, an African slave who had converted to Islam. Bilal was chosen as the first muezzin of Islam because of his beautiful voice. A muezzin is the person who calls the community to the daily prayers, and is a position of great prominence and responsibility. Zayd was a young boy who had grown up in the household of the Prophet as a slave, and remained with the household, almost as an adopted son, even after he was freed. He was amongst the first four people to adopt Islam. Indeed when Zayd's father (a wealthy nobleman) tracked his son down and offered to buy his freedom from Muhammad, Muhammad told Zayd that he was free to go with his father with no money changing hands, and to his father's astonishment Zayd chose to stay with Muhammad. In his lifetime the Prophet introduced the following rules about slavery: Stated that freeing slaves was the act that God found most acceptable Zakat (charity - the third Pillar of Islam) was often used by the state to free slaves Stated that freeing a slave was the appropriate way to gain forgiveness for certain wrongs Ordered that those who committed certain wrongs should be penalised by having to free their slaves Stated that slaves should be allowed to buy their freedom, and if necessary should be given the opportunity to earn money, or be lent money by the state, in order to do so Allowed slaves to be freed in certain circumstances Stated that slaves' contracts should be interpreted in favour of the slaves Stated that the duty of kindness towards slaves was the same of that towards family, neighbours and others Stated that when a slave owner had a child with a female slave, the child should be freed and could inherit from their father like any other child (as in the case of Ibrahim) There are a number of hadith that show that the Prophet treated slaves well and expected others to do the same... He will not enter Paradise who behaveth ill to his slaves. The Companions said, 'O Apostle of God! have you not told us, that there will be a great many slaves and orphans amongst your disciples?' He said, 'Yes; then be kind to them as to your own children, and give them to eat what you eat yourselves. The slaves that say their prayers are your brothers. Be kind to slaves as to your own children...and those that say their prayers are your brethren. They (slaves or servants) are your brothers, and Allah has put them under your command. So the one under whose hand Allah has put his brother, should feed him of what he eats, and give him dresses of what he wears, and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity. And if at all he asks him to do a hard task, he should help him therein.' 'There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the Day of Judgement. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money'. Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari: ""The Prophet said, 'Give food to the hungry, pay a visit to the sick and release (set free) the one in captivity (by paying his ransom).'""  Slavery in Muslim cultures and the Atlantic slave trade Slavery in Muslim history lasted much longer than the Atlantic slave trade - although slavery had existed in many cultures long before Islam. The Muslim slave trade from Africa seems to have enslaved roughly similar numbers (estimates vary between 11 and 14 million Africans) to the Atlantic slave trade, and the transportation conditions endured by victims of the Eastern trade were probably just as horrible in their own way as those of the Atlantic slave trade. One poignant fact is that when the Atlantic slave trade was abolished the Eastern trade expanded, suggesting that for some Africans the abolition of the Atlantic trade didn't lead to freedom, but merely changed their slave destination. Slavery played a significant part in the history of Muslim civilisation, but it was a form of slavery that was inherently different from the 'slave trade' in that the Muslim concept of slavery regarded those enslaved as people who had some, albeit fewer, human rights that must be respected. What was notably different from the slavery of the western world, however, was the degree to which they [slaves] were protected by Muslim law. When the law was observed, their treatment was good. They might expect to marry and have families of their own, and they had a good chance of being freed. There were also built in avenues of escape. Gwyn Campbell; Frank Cass, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 2004 But even though slavery under Islam could be significantly less harsh that that of the Atlantic slave trade, both involved serious breaches of human rights and restricted liberty. However well they were treated the slaves still had restricted freedom, and when the law was not obeyed their lives could be very unpleasant. The relationship between slave and master in Islam is a very different relationship from that between the American plantation labourer and owner. It was a much more personalized relationship and relatively benevolent. Everything here is relative -- being a slave is being a slave and it shouldn't be romanticized. Here are some of the main differences between Muslim slavery and the Atlantic slave trade: The Atlantic trade lasted from the 15th to 19th centuries, the Eastern trade from the 7th or 9th century to the 20th Under Islam slaves were considered people first, and then property. In the Atlantic trade slaves were considered property not people, and often just regarded as units of productive labour Islamic law laid down considerable protection for slaves; those taken for the Atlantic trade had very little protection Islamic law only permitted those conquered in legitimate warfare to be enslaved, all other methods being illegal - although this was often ignored - whereas the Atlantic trade enslaved anyone who had commercial value In Islam, slave-owners were forbidden to take young children from their mothers, something common in the Atlantic trade The owner-slave relationship could be kinder in Islam than in the Atlantic trade, and often more personal Islam recommends the freeing of slaves in itself as a 'good' religious act and says that slaves who convert to Islam should be freed. Zakat (the requirement for charity) was used by Muslim states to free slaves. There were many other avenues whereby a slave could be freed, for example as expiation for irregularities in other religious rituals; as a result many more slaves were freed than in the Atlantic trade Under Islamic law a slave could take his/her master to the Islamic courts to address a grievance, and the judge had the right to grant freedom against the master's wishes and/or other compensations; there was no such protection for slaves taken by the Atlantic trade Islam permitted slaves to attain high office; those taken for the Atlantic trade stayed at the bottom of society In the Atlantic trade there were two males to every female; in the Islamic trade, there were two females to every male Islam permitted women to be enslaved for sexual purposes, although not for prostitution Africans were enslaved in the Atlantic trade to work on an industrial scale in agricultural labour; in the Islamic trade they had a far wider variety of roles The Atlantic trade only involved black Africans; Muslim slavery involved many racial groups Slavery in the Atlantic trade was highly racist, something prohibited in Islam where there was much less institutionalised racism. Both masters and slaves had a wide range of colours and backgrounds; the result is that former slaves became absorbed into the Islamic world, while former slaves remained a discriminated-against underclass in the USA until comparatively recently The nature of the Atlantic trade and therefore the survival of racism in the West has been one of segregation. There wasn't this separation in Islam. Whites didn't push blacks off the pavement. They didn't forbid restaurants to serve them. I don't think that there's any disputing that slavery was a more benevolent institution in Islam than it was in the West.  Something particular to Islamic slave systems was the creation of a slave elite in some Muslim societies that allowed individuals to achieve considerable status, and even power and wealth, while still remaining in some form of 'enslavement'. The slave elite had enormous value to their Muslim masters because they were a military and administrative group made up of 'outsiders' who didn't have tribal and family allegiances that could conflict with their loyalty to their masters. It was believed that a corps of highly trained slaves loyal only to the ruler and dependent entirely on his good will would serve the state more reliably and efficiently than a hereditary nobility, whose interests might compete with those of the ruler. Leslie P. Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, 1993 Elite slavery is something of a paradox: how can a person have power and hold high office and yet still keep the status of a slave? One answer is that the slave gets authority and high office because they are dependant on the person who gives them their authority and status and who could remove that status if they chose. Thus elite slaves must give total loyalty and obedience to their master in order to maintain their privileges. Another view is that the slave who achieves elite status is no longer really a slave, and is able to use their position and power to free themselves of many of the limitations of slavery. This is less convincing since even elite slaves are at risk of losing their privileged status until they break free completely. The dependency was not all one way - the masters in many ways relied on their elite slaves, because those slaves were the only people they could really trust. And there was another reason why elite slaves were valuable - precisely because they were slaves, the elite slaves were free of some of the restrictions that limited free people, and this allowed them to do things for their masters that their masters could not otherwise achieve. Two examples of elite slavery were the Mamluks and the Devshirme system. The Mamluk system became firmly established in the Abbasid Empire during the 9th century. The Mamluks were 'slave soldiers' who eventually came to rule Egypt for over two centuries from 1250 until overthrown by the Ottomans in the 16th century. After a brief period of oppression the Mamluks were able, once again, to play a significant role in running the country. Mamluks were originally soldiers captured in Central Asia, but later boys aged 12-14 were specifically taken or bought to be trained as slave soldiers. Their slave status was shown by the name 'Mamluk' which means 'owned'. Although the Mamluks were not free men (they could not, for example, pass anything on to their children) they were elite slaves who were held in high regard as professional soldiers loyal to their Islamic masters. Historians have been fascinated by the uniqueness of the Mamluk phenomenon. It was inhuman in some respects (for example, Mamluks being denied the opportunity to bequeath their positions and privileges to their sons), yet it provided Islam with a superb military force and a sophisticated political system. In 13th century Egypt loyalty to the masters dissolved and the Mamluks established themselves as the ruling dynasty. Once the Mamluks had successfully revolted against their masters they were, of course, no longer slaves. They remained in power for the period 1250-1517. The basic ideal of military slavery - the Mamluk's total loyalty to his master who had bought, trained, maintained and freed him - was a pillar of Mamluk society in Ottoman Egypt, as it had been in the Mamluk Sultanate. When the master decided that his Mamluk had reached maturity and was ready to assume an office, he set him free, and 'allowed him to grow his beard.' He was now a free man, no longer dependent. The master often appointed these former slaves to army posts, to the beylicate [the beys were high ranking emirs who held important positions in Egyptian government], or to the regimental command. Very often, the master decided whom his former slave would marry, a decision which could advance the Mamluk socially and financially. The devshirme system introduced in the 14th century compelled non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire to hand over some of their children to be converted to Islam and work as slaves. Some writers say that between half a million to one million people were enslaved in this way over the centuries. Conquered Christian communities, especially in the Balkans, had to surrender twenty percent of their male children to the state. Some of these were trained for government service, where they were able to reach very high ranks, even that of Grand Vezir. Many of the others served in the elite military corps of the Ottoman Empire, called the Janissaries, which was almost exclusively made up of forced converts from Christianity. The devshirme played a key role in Sultan Mehmet's conquest of Constantinople, and from then on regularly held very senior posts in the imperial administration. Although members of the devshirme class were technically slaves, they were of great importance to the Sultan because they owed him their absolute loyalty and became vital to his power. This status enabled some of the 'slaves' to become both powerful and wealthy. Their status remained restricted, and their children were not permitted to inherit their wealth or follow in their footsteps. Not all writers agree that the devshirme system was beneficial as well as oppressive, and point out that many Christian families were hostile and resentful about it - which is perhaps underlined by the use of force to impose the system. The devshirme system continued until the end of the seventeenth century. Male slaves who had had their sexual organs removed were called eunuchs, and played an important part in some Muslim societies (as they did in some other cultures). They had the advantage for their masters of not being subject to sexual influence, and as they were unlikely to marry, they had no family ties to hinder their devotion to duty. Eunuch slavery involved compulsory mutilation, which usually took place between the ages of 8 and 12. Without modern medical skills and anaesthetics this was painful, and often led to fatal complications, and sometimes to physical or psychological problems for those who survived the operation. Eunuchs had a particular role as guardians of the harem and were the main way in which the women of the harem had contact with the world outside. In the Ottoman Empire eunuchs from Africa held considerable power from the mid sixteenth century to the eighteenth. It's recorded that the Ottoman family owned 194 eunuchs as late as 1903, of whom 35 'bore a title of some seniority'.  Concubinage may be defined as the more or less permanent cohabitation (outside the marriage bond) of a man with a woman or women, whose position would be that of secondary wives, women bought, acquired by gift, captured in war, or domestic slaves. Muslim cultures are thought to have had more female slaves than male slaves. Enslaved women were given many tasks and one of the most common was working as a domestic servant. But some female slaves were forced to become sex workers: not prostitutes, as this is forbidden in Islam, but concubines. Concubines were women who were sexually available to their master, but not married to him. A Muslim man could have as many concubines as he could afford. Concubinage was not unique to Islam; the Bible records that King Solomon and King David both had concubines, and it is recorded in other cultures too. Being a concubine did have some benefits: if a slave woman gave birth to her owner's child, her status improved dramatically - she could not be sold or given away, and when her owner died she became free. The child was also free and would inherit from their father as any other children. Concubinage was not prostitution in the commercial sense both because that was explicitly forbidden and because only the owner could legitimately have sex with a female slave; anyone else who had sex with her was guilty of fornication. Concubines lived in the harem, an area of the household where women lived separately from men. The nature of Ottoman harems is described by Ehud R Toledano: The harem system grew out of the need in Ottoman society to achieve gender segregation and limit women's accessibility to men who did not belong to their family. Households were divided into two separate sections: the selamlik, housing the male members, and the haremlik, where the women and children dwelt. At the head of the women's part reigned the master's mother or his first wife (out of a maximum of four wives allowed by Islam). The concubines were also part of the harem, where all the attendants were women. Male guests of the master were not entertained in the harem. An active and well-developed social network linked harems of similar status across Ottoman towns and villages; mutual visits and outdoor excursions were common. For the women who actually spent their lives in the harems, reality was, of course, far more mixed and complicated. The women who came into the harem as slaves (câriyes) were taught and trained to be ""ladies,"" learning all the domestic and social roles attached to that position. As they grew up, they would be paired with the men of the family either as concubines or as legal wives. However, harem slaves' freedom of choice was rather limited, as was that of women in general in an essentially male-dominated environment. Harem slaves frequently had to endure sexual harassment from male members of the family. Ehud R. Toledano, Slavery and Abolition in the Ottoman Middle East, 1998 Writers disagree over the nature of concubinage and the harem: Some argue that it was seriously wrong in that it was just slavery women could be bought and sold, or given as gifts it involved compulsory non-consensual sex - which would nowadays be called 'rape' it reinforced male power in the culture Others say that it was relatively benign, because it gave female slaves a chance to gain their freedom A balanced view might be to say that sexual slavery in this context was a very bad thing, but that it was possible for some of the more fortunate victims to gain benefits that provided some degree of compensation. Concubines could play an important political role and have considerable direct political influence on the policy of the state. More than any other Muslim dynasty, the Ottomans raised the practice of slave concubinage to a reproductive principle: after the generations of Osman and Orhan, virtually all offspring of the sultans appear to have been born of concubine mothers. Leslie P. Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, 1993 The benefit to the state, or at least to the ruling dynasty, of having the ruling line born through concubines rather than wives was that only one family was involved - the family of a concubine was irrelevant, but the family of a wife would expect to gain power and influence through their relationship to the mother of the son. These conflicting interests could threaten the succession and weaken the ruling family. (This didn't eliminate conflict between heirs and families altogether, but it probably reduced it.) Concubines as well as wives also played an important role in strengthening cohesion, stability, and continuity at household level too, as this remark about 18th century Cairo demonstrates: Marital and nonmarital unions strengthened the links among men; women legitimized the succession of men to power, and women's property ownership added to the overall wealth, prestige, and power of a household. Mary Ann Fay, From Concubines to Capitalists: Women, Property, and Power in Eighteenth-century Cairo, Journal of Women's History, 1998 And later in the same article the writer describes the inevitable tension inherent in the status of harem women in that society: However, the harem was not a prison; it was instead the family quarters of an upper-class home which became exclusively female space when men not related to the women were in the house and whose entry into the harem was forbidden. Women, heavily veiled, could and did leave their homes... ... Women were not imprisoned in the harem or in the veils and cloaks that concealed their bodies and faces on the street, but both customs were important signifiers of women's lack of sexual autonomy and of men's control over the selection of women's sexual and marital partners. In the economic sphere, however, women had a great deal of autonomy... ... Therefore, the eighteenth-century Egyptian household should not be seen as the site of unrelieved oppression of women but rather in terms of asymmetries of power between men and women. Mary Ann Fay, From Concubines to Capitalists: Women, Property, and Power in Eighteenth-century Cairo, Journal of Women's History, 1998 In the Ottoman Empire the sale of woman as slaves continued until 1908.  Muslims and the abolition of slavery Slavery remained part of the fabric of Islam for over 1200 years (although the Druze, a group that sprung from Muslim roots, abolished it in the 11th century). While slavery was in theory greatly limited by Islamic law, in practice it persisted on a large scale in Muslim lands. During the 20th century attitudes to slavery changed radically and in 1990 The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam stated that: Human beings are born free, and no one has the right to enslave, humiliate, oppress or exploit them, and there can be no subjugation but to God the Most-High. The Declaration also includes a number of other articles that are incompatible with slavery, although ""All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Shari'ah"". Since slavery is permitted by Islamic law, Muslim countries have used secular law to ban it. Some countries outlawed slavery only comparatively recently: The idea that slavery should be abandoned began to be seriously discussed in the 16th century. The Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556-1605) banned the slave trade in his Indian territory. The Muslim leader and reformer Nasr al-Din denounced slavery to the people of Senegal in the 1670s and banned the sale of slaves to Christians there, undermining the French trade in slaves. In some countries, slaves who held high rank demonstrated that slaves were perfectly capable of playing any role in society if they were freed. Egypt had even been ruled by a slave dynasty for more than a century. These traditions slowly changed some Muslim thinking about slavery, and gradually created a climate in which the pressure for abolition could build. But serious abolition for the Muslim world had to wait until the 19th century. Because slavery was accepted by Islamic law it would have been difficult or impossible to forbid slavery itself, so the abolition pressure was concentrated on the transportation of slaves, including the slave markets, which was where the worst cruelties were to be found. Islam forbade raids to gain slaves, making a slave out of a free person and other cruelties. So Muslim abolitionists focused on showing slave trading was illegal under Islamic law, knowing that if they could stop the trade in slaves, slavery itself would slowly die out from lack of supply. For the same reason, colonial powers attacked the trade in slaves as much as the institution of slavery. The slave trade in Muslim societies ended not so much through a single act of abolition but by withering away as the result of external and internal pressure. The outside pressure came from colonial powers that had only recently abandoned slavery themselves: Colonial powers such as Britain and France applied great pressure for the abolition of slavery in their dominions. This pressure was successful in some places, like Egypt, but much less influential in others. Colonial powers also took direct action against slave traders: the British Navy played a role in intercepting and taking action against slave traders, and between 1817 and 1890 signed treaties with over 80 territories allowing them to do this. Internal pressure came from a variety of Muslim sources: From the 1870s, radical and gradual rationalists, together with moderate literalists and progressive ulama, could all be placed in the broad category of opponents of slavery, despite their manifold disagreements. William G. Clarence-Smith, Religions and the abolition of slavery - a comparative approach Muslim abolitionists were influenced by factors like these: The abolition of the Atlantic slave trade provided an enlightening example Some Muslim thinkers saw slavery as colonialist/imperialist behaviour that was incompatible with growing anti-colonialism Some Muslim thinkers regarded slavery as an activity incompatible with the modern world Changes in culture brought about by factors such as urbanisation, changes in the demand for labour, education, a desire to relate to Western nations as equals An increase in the freeing of slaves in some territories helped to accustom people to the ending of slavery The result of these forces was to shrink the slave trade, and put pressure on slavery itself. Initially, it was a source of great hostility that the West dared to intervene in Islamic affairs in contradiction to what was allowed by the Koran. But as Western influence, or modernism, became more and more [widespread], it became less fashionable as well as profitable in Islam to own slaves. And it became illegal over much of the area. The pressures against slavery were extremely great from Western powers. It was the moral issue. It became more scandalous because the conditions of procurement and transport became more and more horrendous. The Ottoman Empire was the major Muslim slave society of the abolition period, and it abolished the slave trade in stages. Although the Ottomans never abolished slavery itself, their policy of restricting the slave trade and increasing opportunities for slaves to get their freedom greatly reduced the number of slaves in its territories: 1867: Programme introduced to help slaves from Russia get their freedom 1887-1880: Conventions against the slave trade signed with Britain Slavery was harder to outlaw in areas far from central government where tribal traditions had been less influenced by the factors above, and where the military power of the centre was much weaker. The slavers retreated into these areas, and moved their slaves to market more secretly. Quite a few of the anti-slavery military initiatives ended in victory for the slavers rather than the forces of abolition. Some other Muslim countries passed laws allowing for the prosecution not only of the sellers of slaves but the buyers too. The Indian Slavery Act of 1844 made slavery illegal there, and Egypt in 1896 implemented laws with very severe penalties for slaving activities. The British felt that they had a mission to do this - as can be seen from this Foreign Office document of 1861: Captain Hamerton should take every opportunity of impressing upon these Arabs that the nations of Europe are destined to put an end to the African Slave Trade, and that Great Britain is the main instrument in the Hands of Providence for the accomplishment of this purpose. That it is in vain for these Arabs to endeavour to resist the consummation of that which is written in the Book of Fate, and that they ought to bow to superior power, to leave off a pursuit which is doomed to annihilation, and a perseverance in which will only involve them in losses and other evils. The British action did not gain universal support. The Sultan of Zanzibar wrote to the British Consul: If I put a stop to the traffic in slaves it will ruin these countries, and it will ruin my subjects; and I am sure that the British Government would never agree to this; my friend, it is in my wish to comply with all the desires of the British Government but these countries cannot do without slaves. For the British Government is far off, and does not know the circumstances of these countries."
30,"The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport, Gillian Merron, will unveil a plaque at Eldon Square Bus Station, Newcastle, on Tuesday.  Newcastle City Council said the new station will offer passengers a modern, comfortable waiting area with automatic doors and air conditioning.  The new station is on Prudhoe Street and replaces the underground concourse off Percy Street.  As well as an extensive CCTV camera network and regular security patrols, the station also boasts artwork by glass artist Dan Savage.  He has produced 19 glass bay screens, screen-printed with enamels in blue, deep pink and black.  The designs are based on the hustle and bustle of a busy city.  Council leader John Shipley said: ""The new bus station will provide a first-class waiting area for passengers, greatly improving the comfort and convenience of travelling by bus."""
31,"The latest new vodka brand has caused a row in the US state of Idaho. But why are so many different types of the colourless, flavourless spirit on sale in the US and UK?  ""I judge a vodka by how I feel the next day. Our hangovers are minimal,"" says Steve Conlin, vice-president of marketing for Ogden's Own Distillery, makers of Five Wives Vodka.  ""It's made from spring water from a mountain spring. It's a good clean vodka.""  Five Wives sold well in Utah, where it is produced and bottled.  But when Conlin applied for a licence to sell it in neighbouring Idaho, it was rejected by the state liquor authority, which decides what gets stocked in the state's stores.  The authority's director, Jeff Anderson, did not like the cheeky name - a reference to polygamy practised by the 19th Century ancestors of America's Mormon population. Also, he said, there was simply no room on the shelves.  ""We've got an over-proliferation of vodkas,"" Anderson told the Idaho Business Review last week.  Idaho sells 450 varieties of vodka, he said, including different sizes of a single brand, and Five Wives would have to compete with 106 other vodkas in its price range.  ""We're telling people 'no' a lot of the time,"" he said. ""Beyond the name, this product is trying to enter a competitive set that is crowded already. ""  In recent years, drinkers in the US and the UK have been overwhelmed by a glut of new vodka brands.  Some of those are traditional Eastern European brands newly introduced on the export market, and others are ""dreamed up overnight"", says Jerald O'Kennard, director of the Beverage Testing Institute in Chicago.  ""It's relatively easy to produce,"" he says. ""You don't have to age it in a warehouse, in a barrel like a whiskey or a rum, and they're the most popular spirits. You've got a tsunami of economic and business reasons contributing to those numbers.""  The spate of new entrants comes even though most drinkers cannot tell the difference between vodkas of similar quality, spirits experts say.  In the US, by law, classic vodka is near flavourless. US regulations require that vodka produced in the US be ""neutral"" and be sold ""without distinctive character, aroma, taste or colour"". Vodkas with added flavouring such as vanilla or rasberry are treated differently.  Spirits experts say that in fact, drunk neat and at room temperature, premium vodkas do offer a variety of subtle variations in flavour, sweetness, mouth feel and weight.  But the average punter who orders a vodka-tonic cannot taste the difference, and even in blind taste tests average drinkers cannot consistently distinguish between different bottles, according to analysis by market research firm Mintel.  ""They're using it in mixed drinks,"" says Noah Rothbaum, editor-in-chief of Liquor.com and author of The Business of Spirits.  ""Once you add it to, say, cranberry juice, or once it's shaken with a lot of ice, those differences are harder and harder to differentiate.""  Many American vodkas contribute little to the actual manufacturing - they merely purchase 95% ethyl alcohol from industrial giants like Archer Daniels Midland or Midwest Grain Processors, add water, and filter the product to varying degrees.  With little noticeable distinction in taste, vodka makers rely on sophisticated marketing and branding campaigns to win customers, analysts say.  ""Making it stand out on the back bar, on the liquor store shelf, making it look cool on the table in a club, these are not small considerations,"" Rothbaum says.  Most wine bottles conform to a handful of different shapes. But companies launching a new vodka brand will hire teams to design a distinct bottle to catch the eye, for instance. (Cheap Shot sells its ""knockout quality"" vodka in a box.)  Distilled Resources Inc, also in Idaho, ferments, distils and bottles high-end flavoured and unflavoured vodkas for dozens of brands who contract with the company.  ""They came up with the name, they selected the bottle,"" says Gray Ottley, the distillery's director and vice-chairman, about one of the vodkas.  ""That's their brand. They filed the trade mark.""  In fact, three of the company's oldest brand partners - Blue Ice, Glacier and Zodiac - sell the same potato vodka, Ottley says.  Ogden's Own, based in Ogden, Utah, markets its vodka to drinkers who want something made locally.  The label, which features five young women in 19th Century dress coyly tugging at their petticoats, was an irreverent nod to Utah's Mormon history.  ""Our label is quirky and interesting,"" says Conlin. ""People like local.""  It has sold well in the six months it has been on the market, approaching Absolut in the 750ml category, he says.  Since Jeff Anderson of the Idaho liquor authority suggested religious and moral considerations played a role in the decision to keep Five Wives off the shelf, Ogden's Own hired a prominent Washington constitutional lawyer.  On Wednesday, Idaho relented and agreed to allow retail customers, bars and restaurants in the state to place special orders of Five Wives. Anderson also invited Conlin to reapply to sell Five Wives on store shelves.  ""The exposure's been very good,"" Conlin says.  ""We're happy to have this resolved and hopefully we'll be selling product in Idaho fairly quickly."""
32,"In 1858, British Crown rule was established in India, ending a century of control by the East India Company. The life and death struggle that preceded this formalisation of British control lasted nearly two years, cost £36 million, and is variously referred to as the 'Great Rebellion', the 'Indian Mutiny' or the 'First War of Indian Independence'. Inevitably, the consequences of this bloody rupture marked the nature of political, social and economic rule that the British established in its wake. It is important to note that the Raj (in Hindi meaning 'to rule' or 'kingdom') never encompassed the entire land mass of the sub-continent. Two-fifths of the sub-continent continued to be independently governed by over 560 large and small principalities, some of whose rulers had fought the British during the 'Great Rebellion', but with whom the Raj now entered into treaties of mutual cooperation. The 'Great Rebellion' helped create a racial chasm between ordinary Indians and Britons. Indeed the conservative elites of princely India and big landholders were to prove increasingly useful allies, who would lend critical monetary and military support during the two World Wars. Hyderabad for example was the size of England and Wales combined, and its ruler, the Nizam, was the richest man in the world. They would also serve as political bulwarks in the nationalist storms that gathered momentum from the late 19th century and broke with insistent ferocity over the first half of the 20th century. But the 'Great Rebellion' did more to create a racial chasm between ordinary Indians and Britons. This was a social segregation which would endure until the end of the Raj, graphically captured in EM Forster's 'A Passage to India'. While the British criticised the divisions of the Hindu caste system, they themselves lived a life ruled by precedence and class, deeply divided within itself. Rudyard Kipling reflected this position in his novels. His books also exposed the gulf between the 'white' community and the 'Anglo-Indians', whose mixed race caused them to be considered racially 'impure'.  While there was a consensus that Indian policy was above party politics, in practice it became embroiled in the vicissitudes of Westminster. Successive viceroys in India and secretaries of state in London were appointed on a party basis, having little or no direct experience of Indian conditions and they strove to serve two masters. Edwin Montagu was the first serving secretary of state to visit India on a fact-finding mission in 1917-1918. 1,200 civil servants could not rule 300 to 350 million Indians without indigenous 'collaborators'. Broadly speaking, the Government of India combined a policy of co-operation and conciliation of different strata of Indian society with a policy of coercion and force. The empire was nothing if not an engine of economic gain. Pragmatism dictated that to govern efficiently and remuneratively, 1,200 Indian civil servants could not rule 300 to 350 million Indians without the assistance of indigenous 'collaborators'. However, in true British tradition, they also chose to elaborate sophisticated and intellectual arguments to justify and explain their rule. On the one hand, Whigs and Liberals expounded sentiments most iconically expressed by TB Macaulay in 1833: 'that... by good government we may educate our subjects into a capacity for better government, that, having become instructed in European knowledge, they may, in some future age, demand European institutions. Whether such a day will ever come I know not. ... Whenever it comes, it will be the proudest day in English history.' On the other hand, James Fitzjames Stephen, writing in the 1880s, contended that empire had to be absolute because 'its great and characteristic task is that of imposing on Indian ways of life and modes of thought which the population regards without sympathy, though they are essential to its personal well-being and to the credit of its rulers.' What was less ambiguous was that it was the economic interests of Britain that were paramount, though as the 20th century progressed, the government in India was successful in imposing safeguards. For instance, tariff walls were raised to protect the Indian cotton industry against cheap British imports.  There were two incontrovertible economic benefits provided by India. It was a captive market for British goods and services, and served defence needs by maintaining a large standing army at no cost to the British taxpayer. However, the economic balance sheet of the empire remains a controversial topic and the debate has revolved around whether the British developed or retarded the Indian economy. Controversy remains over whether Britain developed or retarded India's economy. Among the benefits bequeathed by the British connection were the large scale capital investments in infrastructure, in railways, canals and irrigation works, shipping and mining; the commercialisation of agriculture with the development of a cash nexus; the establishment of an education system in English and of law and order creating suitable conditions for the growth of industry and enterprise; and the integration of India into the world economy. Conversely, the British are criticised for leaving Indians poorer and more prone to devastating famines; exhorting high taxation in cash from an inpecunious people; destabilising cropping patterns by forced commercial cropping; draining Indian revenues to pay for an expensive bureaucracy (including in London) and an army beyond India's own defence needs; servicing a huge sterling debt, not ensuring that the returns from capital investment were reinvested to develop the Indian economy rather than reimbursed to London; and retaining the levers of economic power in British hands.  The foundation of the Indian National Congress in 1885 as an all India, secular political party, is widely regarded as a key turning point in formalising opposition to the Raj. It developed from its elite intellectual middle-class confines, and a moderate, loyalist agenda, to become by the inter-war years, a mass organisation. It was an organisation which, despite the tremendous diversity of the sub-continent, was remarkable in achieving broad consensus over the decades. Also split within Congress were those who advocated violence and those who stressed non-violence. Yet it was not a homogenous organisation and was often dominated by factionalism and opposing political strategies. This was exemplified by its splintering in 1907 into the so-called 'moderate' and 'extremist' wings, which reunited 10 years later. Another example were the 'pro-changers' (who believed working the constitutional structures to weaken it from within) and 'no-changers' (who wanted to distance themselves from the Raj) during the 1920s. There was also a split within Congress between those who believed that violence was a justifiable weapon in the fight against imperial oppression (whose most iconic figure was Subhas Chandra Bose, who went on to form the Indian National Army), and those who stressed non-violence. The towering figure in this latter group was Mahatma Gandhi, who introduced a seismic new idiom of opposition in the shape of non-violent non-cooperation or 'satyagraha' (meaning 'truth' or 'soul' force'). Gandhi oversaw three major nationwide movements which achieved varying degrees of success in 1920-1922, 1930-1934 and in 1942. These mobilised the masses on the one hand, while provoking the authorities into draconian repression. Much to Gandhi's distress, self-restraint among supporters often gave way to violence.  The British Raj unravelled quickly in the 1940s, perhaps surprising after the empire in the east had so recently survived its greatest challenge in the shape of Japanese expansionism. The reasons for independence were multifaceted and the result of both long and short term factors. The pressure from the rising tide of nationalism made running the empire politically and economically very challenging and increasingly not cost effective. This pressure was embodied as much in the activities of large pan-national organisations like the Congress as in pressure from below - from the 'subalterns' through the acts of peasant and tribal resistance and revolt, trade union strikes and individual acts of subversion and violence. With US foreign policy pressurising the end of western imperialism, it seemed only a matter of time before India gained its freedom. There were further symptoms of the disengagement from empire. European capital investment declined in the inter-war years and India went from a debtor country in World War One to a creditor in World War Two. Applications to the Indian Civil Service (ICS) declined dramatically from the end of the Great War. Britain's strategy of a gradual devolution of power, its representation to Indians through successive constitutional acts and a deliberate 'Indianisation' of the administration, gathered a momentum of its own. As a result, India moved inexorably towards self-government. The actual timing of independence owed a great deal to World War Two and the demands it put on the British government and people. The Labour party had a tradition of supporting Indian claims for self-rule, and was elected to power in 1945 after a debilitating war which had reduced Britain to her knees. Furthermore, with US foreign policy pressurising the end of western subjugation and imperialism, it seemed only a matter of time before India gained its freedom.  The growth of Muslim separatism from the late 19th century and the rise of communal violence from the 1920s to the virulent outbreaks of 1946-1947, were major contributory factors in the timing and shape of independence. However, it was only from the late 1930s that it became inevitable that independence could only be achieved if accompanied by a partition. This partition would take place along the subcontinent's north-western and north-eastern boundaries, creating two sovereign nations of India and Pakistan. The Muslim League failed to achieve the confidence of the majority of Muslims in the elections of 1937. Muslims, as a religious community, comprised only 20% of the population and represented great diversity in economic, social and political terms. From the late 19th century, some of its political elites in northern India felt increasingly threatened by British devolution of power, which by the logic of numbers would mean the dominance of the majority Hindu community. Seeking power and a political voice in the imperial structure, they organised themselves into a party to represent their interests, founding the Muslim League in 1906. They achieved something of a coup by persuading the British that they needed to safeguard the interests of the minorities, a demand that fed into British strategies of divide and rule. The inclusion of separate electorates along communal lines in the 1909 Act, subsequently enlarged in every successive constitutional act, enshrined a form of constitutional separatism. While there is no denying that Islam and Hinduism were and are very different faiths, Muslims and Hindus continued to co-exist peaceably. There were, however, occasional violent outbursts which were driven more often than not by economic inequities. Even politically, the Congress and the League cooperated successfully during the Khilafat and Non Cooperation movements in 1920-1922. And Muhammad Ali Jinnah (the eventual father of the Pakistani nation) was a Congress member till 1920. Although Congress strove to stress its secular credentials with prominent Muslim members - for example, Maulana Azad served as its president through World War Two - it is criticised for failing to sufficiently recognise the importance of a conciliatory position towards the League in the inter-war years, and for its triumphant response to Congress's 1937 election victory. The Muslim League advocated the idea of Pakistan in its annual session in 1930, yet the idea did not achieve any political reality at the time. Furthermore, the League failed to achieve the confidence of the majority of the Muslim population in the elections of 1937.  The lack of confidence in the Muslim League among the Muslim population was to be dramatically reversed in the 1946 elections. The intervening years saw the rise of Jinnah and the League to political prominence through the successful exploitation of the wartime insecurities of the British, and the political vacuum created when the Congress ministries (which had unanimously come to power in 1937) resigned en masse to protest at the government's unilateral decision to enter India into the war without consultation. The creation of Pakistan as a land for Muslims nevertheless left a sizeable number of Muslims in an independent India. The rejuvenated League skilfully exploited the communal card. At its Lahore session in 1940, Jinnah made the demand for Pakistan into its rallying cry. The ensuing communal violence, especially after Jinnah declared 'Direct Action Day' in August 1946, put pressure on the British government and Congress to accede to his demands for a separate homeland for Muslims. The arrival of Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last viceroy in March 1947, brought with it an agenda to transfer power as quickly and efficiently as possible. The resulting negotiations saw the deadline for British withdrawal brought forward from June 1948 to August 1947. Contemporaries and subsequent historians have criticised this haste as a major contributory factor in the chaos that accompanied partition. Mass migration occurred across the new boundaries as well as an estimated loss of a million lives in the communal bloodbaths involving Hindus, Muslims and also Sikhs in the Punjab. The final irony must remain that the creation of Pakistan as a land for Muslims nevertheless left a sizeable number of Muslims in an independent India making it the largest minority in a non-Muslim state.

33,"A painting that may be by the Italian master Caravaggio and worth £94m ($135m) has been found in the loft of a house in southern France.  It was found in Toulouse two years ago and passed to art expert Eric Turquin, who says it is a version of the 1599 work, Judith Beheading Holofernes.  He said it was discovered by the owners when they investigated a roof leak.  The French government has placed a bar on the work leaving the country for 30 months while tests are carried out.  The work, which depicts the Biblical heroine Judith beheading an Assyrian general, is thought to have gone missing about 100 years after it was painted.  Another version of it, which was also thought to be lost before its rediscovery in 1950, hangs in Rome's National Gallery of Ancient Art.  Experts at Paris' Louvre Museum are examining the work to try to establish its creator, though Turquin said there would ""never be a consensus"" on who painted it.  If it proves to be genuine, the French Government will be given the first chance to purchase the work."
34,"Wayne Rooney hit a hat-trick and Javier Hernandez scored twice as a rampant Manchester United outclassed Bolton to go top of the Premier League.  The champions took an early lead when Hernandez pounced at the near post.  Rooney converted Phil Jones' cross to make it two, then the England striker profited from another of the defender's runs to add a third.  Hernandez swept in a fourth before Rooney drilled in his third - but Tom Cleverley may have broken his foot.  Crumpling under a heavy challenge from Kevin Davies, the midfielder was replaced midway through the first half.  But it was the only blemish for Sir Alex Ferguson's side after another impeccable performance brought up their 200th away win in the Premier League - the first club to achieve the milestone.  United's last trip to the Reebok Stadium ended in a 2-2 draw almost a year ago, when they had to rely on a late Michael Owen header to salvage a point.  But this encounter was very different as Hernandez, making his first start of the season, gave United the perfect opening.  Showing the superb movement he is renowned for, the Mexico striker lost Gary Cahill with a darting run to the near post to steer in Nani's tantalising low cross from the right.  The goal came while United were temporarily down to 10 men following the injury to Cleverley.  Bolton looked to hit back immediately, but former United midfielder Chris Eagles saw his shot cleared off the line by Rooney.  Despite the high-profile errors United's new goalkeeper David De Gea has made this season, he went some way to silencing his doubters with an impressive flying save from Ivan Klasnic's long-range effort. And the stop ignited United, who made it 2-0 just 74 seconds later.  United's verve and invention overwhelmed Bolton and Rooney doubled United's lead in the 20th minute.  Catching the home side napping, Jones whipped in a devilish cross from the right to Rooney, who found himself between Cahill and Dedryck Boyata before prodding in from close range.  Rooney poured further misery on the home side, making it 3-0 in the 24th minute with a goal engineered by Jones, whose stature is growing with every game.  Exploiting a gaping hole in the home side's defence, Jones' twinkle-toed run took him into the penalty area, before he squared the ball to Rooney to find the back of the net with the easiest of finishes.  With manager Owen Coyle barking instructions from the touchline, Bolton limited United to three in the first half but, while Klasnic and Martin Petrov linked well at times, the home side were painfully short of creativity.  It was only a matter of time before United added to their lead and, two minutes before the hour mark, Hernandez made it 4-0.  Substitute Michael Carrick found the Mexican lurking at the far post and, with the Bolton defence at sea, his low effort had Jussi Jaaskelainen well beaten.  Nigel Reo-Coker struck the crossbar as Bolton desperately looked for a route back into the game but, minutes later, Rooney put the gloss on the win with United's fifth - and his third.  Collecting Nani's cut-back from the right the England striker nonchalantly struck his hat-trick goal from the edge of the box to give him his seventh career treble.  Rooney also becomes the fourth player to score back-to-back Premier League hat-tricks after Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright and Didier Drogba.  Sequels rarely match the original and United's short trip to the Reebok was always likely to pale in comparison to their famous 8-2 mauling of Arsenal a fortnight ago - but United remain the team to beat after another scintillating display."
35,"Same-sex couples will be able to get married in England and Wales after new measures became law.  The government's controversial legislation on the issue received Royal Assent on Wednesday.  The Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat leaderships all backed the proposals, which were finally approved by MPs and peers earlier this week.  It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year.  Under the terms of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, religious organisations will have to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so.  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced the bill had received Royal Assent - the formal approval of the sovereign required for all legislation. The news was greeted with cheers in the Commons chamber.  MPs decided not to oppose a number of minor changes agreed by the House of Lords and approved the legislation on Tuesday.  There will also be a review of whether groups such as the humanists will be allowed to carry out marriages, while ministers said they were prepared to look at eliminating any difference in the treatment of gay couples when it came to pension schemes.  During the Commons debate, Equalities Minister Maria Miller said the passing of the bill was ""clear affirmation"" that ""respect for each and every person is paramount, regardless of age, religion, gender, ethnicity or sexuality"", she added.  But Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, one of the bill's opponents, said it was ""astonishing that a bill for which there is absolutely no mandate, against which a majority of Conservatives voted, has been bulldozed through both Houses"".  He added: ""I think the government should think very carefully in future if they want the support of these benches. Offending large swathes of the Conservative Party is not a good way of going about it.""  But Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said: ""It's wonderful to see same-sex marriage achieve legal recognition. Quakers see the light of God in everyone so we respect the inherent worth of each individual and each loving relationship."""
36,"        I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue is 30 years old this week. How come it's lasted so long?     Graeme: Because it started in 1972.  Barry: That would do it!  Tim: If I was to be serious, I think the main thing is Humphrey Lyttelton. He has one of those voices. He's funny, he's absolutely filthy, but not filthy - ""brilliant-minded"" by Iain Pattinson. The really sad thing about this anniversary is that Willie Rushton is not here because he's such an integral part of it. I had a chat with him actually the week before he died and I said, ""When will this ever finish?"". And he said, ""Well it can go on as long as Humph's around"". And I think that's what we all feel now.    Graeme, you devised the show and it's been said that the inspiration was greed and laziness. Can you explain?    Graeme: Well, that's quite true, yes. We'd been doing I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again on the radio and Bill Oddie and I had been writing most of the scripts and we discovered that we were paid more for writing scripts on television. And it was not quite such hard work as writing for radio. So I came up with the idea because I'd done a panel game and been a guest on a panel game and thought 'this is quite easy really'. All you do is you give people a set of rules and hope that they're funny and then you just broadcast the funny bits. So David Hatch and myself made up a panel game with 'apparently' serious rounds.    Do you remember who picked the theme music?    Graeme: David Hatch I think picked it. He played it to me in his office and said, ""What about this?"" And I thought, ""That's totally inappropriate. That will do!""  Tim: There's another reason I remember it was David because you (Graeme) had been on a panel show with Gyles Brandreth and you said, ""This is really easy. It's money for old rope. So let's get a bit of that money and we'll provide the old rope! Wasn't it?  Graeme: That's right. In fact we nearly called it Old Rope.  Tim: Unfortunately we didn't get the money.  Graeme: The music is a piece of music called the Schickel Shamble. That's for anoraks out there.  Barry: Monte Carlo or Bust, wasn't it?  Tim: Yeah.    There was going to be a TV version of Clue but you were deemed too old for television.    Tim: Well, we did a pilot. BBC weren't interested, naturally. So we did a pilot for ITV and everybody seemed to like it. We didn't get it quite right but it was going in the right direction. It went to the central area where they decide what to put on and they said, ""Yes, great programme but could we have some younger people in it?""  Barry: Can I apologise for hogging this?  Graeme: Yes, of course you can.  Barry: I apologise for hogging this.  Graeme: At the back of all our minds was the worry that it is such a radio programme. It really exists on radio and works on radio and is about radio and putting it on television might somehow take away from its myth, might somehow spoil the radio show. We were never 100% about it.  Tim: I was 100% about it as long as you kept going on on radio at the same time. That was pure greed though!  Barry: Willie was ambivalent as I remember, sort of bolt fast at one point.  Tim: I would actually quite like to have done it in a way because then we could have done some visual jokes which you can't do on radio. So there would have been an extra element and we started to try and put those on the pilot, didn't we? And not many of them worked because they technically wouldn't work!    More...     "
37,"More than 200 billion CDs have been sold worldwide since then and it remains the dominant format despite the growth in digital downloads.  The CD was jointly developed by Philips and Sony and the disc has also become a key storage method for computer users.  The first CD produced was The Visitors by Abba.  Piet Kramer, who was a member of the optical group at Philips during the disc's development, said: ""When Philips teamed up with Sony to develop the CD, our first target was to win over the world for the CD.  ""We did this by collaborating openly to agree on a new standard. For Philips, this open innovation was a new approach and it paid off.""  He said the companies had never imagined that the computing and entertainment industries would also opt for the CD as a storage system for content.  Jacques Heemskerk, who was one of the senior engineers involved with the optical side of CD players, said the team knew they were building a revolutionary product.  ""It was revolutionary in many fields - the optics were new, the disc was new. At the start of development there wasn't even a laser that would work well enough for our needs.  ""The most advanced laser at the time had a lifespan of only 100 hours.""  He said the company had always planned on the format lasting at least 20 to 25 years.  ""That was the model we had in mind although it seems that CD is going to last a lot longer than that. For many people the CD is still the original format, with others being derivative or back-ups.""  The two companies began work on the format in 1979 and targetted a disc which could hold an hour of audio. The capacity was extended to 74 minutes, however, to accommodate a complete performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, forcing the disk to be made slightly larger.""  ""I always wish we had stuck with the original plan for an 11cm disc; it would have been more suited to the on-the-go age,"" said Mr Heemskerk.  He said that it had been a big culture shock for Philips when they had allied with Sony.  ""The world was not as globalised as it is today. Our management had told us to be as open as possible and to share everything because that was the only way to have success.  ""But we were suspicious and so were their engineers. But after a few days it became clear we could work together.""  He added: ""There were other companies working on similar technologies, so there was pressure.  ""We always knew we could make the product but it was always about making it for the right cost and at scale.""  The first CDs went on sale in November 1982 and were mainly classical recordings.  Classical music lovers were believed to be more affluent than pop and rock music fans, and Philips thought they would be more inclined to pay the price for the more expensive CDs and the very expensive CD-players,  The first models cost 2,000 Dutch guilders, about £1,000 at today's rate, taking into account inflation.  ""When Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau recorded one of the first CDs for Polygram we discovered that he was grunting and panting while playing. Before on vinyl you didn't hear that but on CD it was crystal clear,"" said Frank van den Berg, a former member of the Polygram CD development task force.  In the last 10 years CD sales have been dropping worldwide while digital download sales are rising rapidly.  According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), digital sales will account for a quarter of all worldwide music sales by 2010.  CD sales in the UK have dropped 10% in the first half of this year, while download purchases have increased by 50%.  Richard Gooch, head of technology at IFPI, said: ""CDs remain a very popular format for buying music in the digital era - indeed as CDs are a digital format they actually kick-started the digital age.  ""The CD remained the most popular Christmas present in Britain last year. Despite the rise of downloading we expect that the CD will be here for many years to come.""  Mr Heemskerk said CDs remained his format of choice.  ""I don't have an iPod, although my youngest son uses one. But CDs are still his preferred format and he copies them on to his MP3 player."""
38,"Iraq's outlawed Baath Party named Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri as its new leader shortly after the execution of Saddam Hussein. Mr Douri - a former deputy Iraqi president - was one of the ousted leader's closest aides and most trusted confidents. But since the fall of Saddam Hussein's rule, he has been declared dead several times. And even though the Baath Party's statement was posted in his name on the internet, it is still unclear whether Mr Douri is still alive. Mr Douri was number six on the US list of most wanted Iraqis. But after the death or capture of other Iraqi leaders, the Americans said he was the ""single most significant regime figure"" still at large. They accuse him of co-ordinating some of the attacks on US-led forces and have offered a $10m reward for his capture. Four of Mr Douri's nephews were captured in January 2004, two months after the arrest of his wife and daughter. If you have forgotten Halabja, we are ready to repeat the operation    Izzat Ibrahim to the Kurds, reminding them of chemical attacks they suffered Mr Douri was one of the key plotters who carried out the coup that brought the Baath Party to power in 1968. In later years he served as the Iraqi leader's number two in the powerful Revolution Command Council, as vice-chairman. Mr Douri was deputy commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and held a senior post on the committee responsible for northern Iraq when chemical weapons were used in 1988, killing thousands of Kurds. War crimes charges were issued against him in Austria. When the first Gulf War broke out in 1991, The New York Times newspaper quoted Mr Douri as warning the Kurds not to cause trouble. He allegedly reminded them of the chemical attack with the words: ""If you have forgotten Halabja, I would like to remind you that we are ready to repeat the operation."" Mr Douri was born the son of an ice seller in 1942 near Tikrit, where Saddam Hussein had his power base. He joined the Baath Party, rising swiftly through the ranks after the 1968 coup. In the 1970s, he served as both agriculture and interior minister. Diagnosed with leukaemia several years ago, his subsequent recovery enabled him to pursue a challenging domestic and foreign work schedule. He travelled abroad frequently as the Iraqi leader's envoy and was sent to woo neighbouring states during the pre-war stand-off with Washington. At the 2002 Arab summit in Beirut, Mr Douri broke the ice by publicly shaking hands with the Kuwaiti foreign minister and embracing the Saudi crown prince. Both countries had previously refused to have any direct dealings with Iraq. He pledged to respect Kuwait's ""territorial integrity"". He chaired the Arab Parliamentary Union session in Baghdad in September 2002, calling for Arab solidarity in the face of the ""American-Zionist threat"". He had some narrow shaves, escaping an assassination attempt in the city of Karbala in 1998, and avoiding arrest in Vienna in 1999 for suspected crimes against humanity while on a private visit for medical treatment. Announcing that Saddam Hussein had won 100% approval in a 2002 referendum to give him another term as president, Mr Douri hailed ""the great success of this unique democratic practice"". Mr Douri's daughter was briefly married to Saddam Hussein's elder son, Uday, who - together with his brother Qusay - was killed by US forces in Mosul in July 2003.     "
39,"Thousands of well-wishers gathered to see the aircraft land at Filton Airfield on Wednesday.  The plane left London's Heathrow Airport at 1130 GMT, flying out across the Bay of Biscay and then back to Bristol, where she landed soon after 1300 GMT.  Carrying 100 British Airways cabin crew members and pilots, it was the last of the seven BA Concordes to arrive at its new home.  The jet reached supersonic speeds over the north Atlantic, and flew past the airfield before landing in front of crowds of more than 20,000 and being welcomed to Filton by Prince Andrew.  With pilot Les Brodie at the controls, the jet performed a lap of honour above Bristol, flying over Portishead, Clevedon and Weston-super-Mare, Bristol Airport, Clifton Suspension Bridge and the Downs.  One of the most popular viewing spots was the Clifton Suspension Bridge, but only 600 people were allowed on to the structure to watch the flypast.  Many of those who braved the showers to watch the historic flight had helped to develop and build the plane in the 1960s and 1970s.  As the plane finally landed, the Duke of York welcomed the flight and received the 1979-built plane on behalf of the Bristol community.  The Duke said it was a ""truly memorable occasion"", that the plane was an ""icon of the 20th century"" and thanked the dedication of the staff who had worked on it.  ""Today is one of the saddest in aviation history but at the same time, it's a day to reflect on the glory of what the UK can achieve,"" he said.  At the foot of the plane's steps, senior Concorde pilot Mike Bannister said: ""This fabulous aircraft will be a legend because of one thing, the people.  ""The people made Concorde a legend and we will never forget it.""  Concorde ended three decades of supersonic travel in October when the final commercial flights from New York landed at Heathrow.  Since then, British Airways has distributed the planes to new homes across the world, including New York, Seattle, Barbados and Manchester."
40,"The UAE base will host up to 500 French troops    President Nicolas Sarkozy has formally opened a French military base in the United Arab Emirates, France's first permanent base in the Gulf. The flags of France and the UAE were raised at a ceremony at the so-called ""Peace Camp"" in the Abu Dhabi emirate. France is a leading military supplier to the Gulf state, and signed a nuclear co-operation agreement last year. Its new base will host up to 500 French troops and include a navy base, air base, and training camp. The BBC's Stephanie Hancock in Abu Dhabi says the new military base, France's first outside its own territory for many years, comes on the back of strengthening diplomatic and military ties between France and the United Arab Emirates. The 500 troops will be there on a support and training capacity, rather than taking part in actual military operations. Through this base - the first in the Middle East - France is ready to shoulder its responsibilities to ensure stability in this strategic region    But our correspondent says the base will provide all-important reassurance to the Emirates, which, along with many of its Arab neighbours, is concerned about the nuclear threat posed by Iran. ""Be assured that France is on your side in the event your security is at risk,"" Mr Sarkozy said in an interview with the UAE's official news agency. ""Through this base - the first in the Middle East - France is ready to shoulder its responsibilities to ensure stability in this strategic region."" An aide to Mr Sarkozy is quoted by AFP news agency linking the base to an alleged Iranian threat: ""We are deliberately taking a deterrent stance. If Iran were to attack, we would effectively be attacked also."" Correspondents say the base has drawn some criticism in French political circles for just that reason, with centrist politician Francois Bayrou warning that France risked being dragged into a regional war. Mr Sarkozy flew to Abu Dhabi on Monday with four ministers and a delegation of senior businesspeople. He opened the visit by dining with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Officials said talks are continuing over the possible sale of 60 new Rafale jets to the UAE in a deal worth up to eight billion euros ($11bn). The multi-role Rafale - which has yet to find a foreign buyer - could replace the Emirates' fleet of French Mirage 2000 combat planes. In addition to the inauguration of Peace Camp, Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the site of a Louvre Museum branch which France is opening in the United Arab Emirates. The US maintains the predominant foreign military presence in the Gulf, with key air bases and logistics operations, and its Fifth Fleet housed in Bahrain. However, Peace Camp gives France a strategic position on the vital Gulf shipping corridor, which carries about 40% of the world's petroleum supplies.     "
41,"Research by a British scientist has concluded that the legendary Himalayan yeti may in fact be a sub-species of brown bear.  DNA tests on hair samples carried out by Oxford University genetics professor Bryan Sykes found that they matched those from an ancient polar bear.  He subjected the hairs to the most advanced tests available.  He says the most likely explanation for the myth is that the animal is a hybrid of polar bears and brown bears.  Prof Sykes told the BBC that there may be a real biological animal behind the yeti myth.  ""I think this bear, which nobody has seen alive,... may still be there and may have quite a lot of polar bear in it,"" he said.  ""It may be some sort of hybrid and if its behaviour is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, then I think that may well be the source of the mystery and the source of the legend.""  Prof Sykes conducted the DNA tests on hairs from two unidentified animals, one from Ladakh - in northern India on the west of the Himalayas - and the other from Bhutan, 1,285km (800 miles) further east.  The results were then compared with the genomes of other animals that are stored on a database of all published DNA sequences.  Prof Sykes found that he had a 100% match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago - a time when the polar bear and closely related brown bear were separating as different species.  The species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap.  The sample from Ladakh came from the mummified remains of a creature shot by a hunter around 40 years ago, while the second sample was in the form of a single hair, found in a bamboo forest by an expedition of filmmakers around 10 years ago.  Prof Sykes said that his results were ""completely unexpected"" and that more work needed to be done interpreting them.  He said that while they did not mean that ""ancient polar bears are wandering around the Himalayas"", there could be a sub-species of brown bear in the High Himalayas descended from an ancestor of the polar bear.  ""Or it could mean there has been more recent hybridisation between the brown bear and the descendant of the ancient polar bear,"" he said.  In 2008 scientists in the US examined hairs given to the BBC which some had claimed were from a yeti.  The scientists concluded that in fact the hairs - obtained from the north-east Indian state of Meghalaya - belonged to a species of Himalayan goat known as a Himalayan Goral."
42,"Dire Straits enjoyed a string of hits in the 1980s before disbanding Dire Straits bassist John Illsley has revealed how he has tried to persuade former bandmate Mark Knopfler to re-form the group - without success. ""He's doing different kinds of music now,"" said the guitarist, who said he would ""love to do"" a reunion tour. ""I'm very open to doing whatever's suggested,"" he added. ""I think we've definitely got one more tour left in us, and probably another record too."" According to Illsley, though, this would be ""entirely up to Mark"". Formed in 1977, Dire Straits were one of the biggest bands of the '80s thanks to such hits as Sultans of Swing, Money for Nothing and Brothers in Arms. The British group, which at one stage featured Knopfler's brother David, disbanded in the early '90s. Illsley, who is about to release an album, Beautiful You, with Irish singer Greg Pearle, said he and Knopfler discussed reforming ""from time to time"". Illsley's new record with Greg Pearle is released next week """"He says 'Oh, I don't know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again.' ""Mark and I were the only two left in '93, so it's really up to him and I if it happens at all,"" he added. ""But he's doing incredibly well as a solo artist, so hats off to him. He's having a perfectly good time doing what he's doing."" Last year Knopfler said he did not miss the global fame that came his way at the height of the band's success. ""It just got too big,"" he revealed at the Hay Literary Festival. ""If anyone can tell me one good thing about fame, I'd be very interested to hear it."""

Testifying to the US Congress, Gen Stanley McChrystal said Bin Laden had become an ""iconic figure"". He said President Barack Obama's deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant success was possible. But he said the mission was ""undeniably difficult"" and the next 18 months would be crucial. ""I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed,"" said Gen McChrystal of Bin Laden. ""I believe he is an iconic figure at this point, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organisation across the world."" The general said that killing or capturing Bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but that the movement could not be eradicated while Bin Laden remained at large. The militant leader is believed to be living in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates said last week that officials have had no reliable information on Bin Laden's whereabouts for ""years"". Gen McChrystal told the Congressional hearing the next 18 months would be crucial in Afghanistan, but that he did not expect to need more troops to get the job done. He said coalition forces faced ""a complex and resilient insurgency"" and that Afghans lacked confidence in their government. ""Success will require steadfast commitment and incur significant costs,"" he told the House Armed Services Committee. It is said the general only takes one meal a day so maybe he used the lunch hour to reflect that his worries are not the same as those on the Hill who worry more about perceptions of weakness.    The commander said the 30,000 US reinforcements would ""provide us the ability to reverse insurgent momentum and deny the Taliban the access to the population they require to survive"". He said he did not think he would need to ask for any more troops in a year's time, but would not hesitate to recommend more if circumstances changed. The US ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, who questioned the troop build-up during White House deliberations last month, also endorsed the new approach as ""the best path to stabilise Afghanistan"". Mr Eikenberry agreed with Gen McChrystal that Bin Laden was key to that process. He said it was ""important to the American people - indeed, the people of the world - that one day Osama Bin Laden is either captured or killed, brought to justice"". The new battle plan includes an 18-month timeline before the first US troops would begin to come home. Hours before the panel convened, Mr Gates held talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the capital, Kabul. Speaking at a joint news conference afterwards, President Karzai warned that it would take 15 years before Afghanistan was able to pay for the cost of its own security forces, which the US wants to quadruple in size to 400,000 troops by 2013. ""We hope that the international community and the United States, as our first ally, will help Afghanistan reach the ability to sustain a force,"" he said. For his part, Mr Karzai said he hoped the US and the international community would continue funding them, adding the US would not abandon Afghanistan. The two countries would need to be long-term partners, he said. The defence secretary said Mr Karzai needed to take a tougher line on corruption, but added that many ministers were competent and did not need to be replaced when a new cabinet is announced in the coming days. Mr Karzai said he was committed to doing so and that he would inform parliament of the names of a number of proposed ministers. Both men then agreed that it was a priority to strengthen the Afghan security forces in order to help international troops tackle insurgents. But Mr Karzai was also cautiously optimistic that his country would be able to begin taking over responsibility for security in some ""critical"" parts of the country within two years, before taking charge nationwide in five years' time. The president later condemned what his office said was the killing of six civilians in an overnight operation by Nato-led forces in the eastern province of Laghman. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Residents have protested against the reported civilian deaths, which they and provincial officials say number 12. The Nato-led International Security Assistance Force said its troops killed seven militants and detained another four after coming under hostile fire while pursuing a member of the Taliban responsible for suicide bombings in the area. Meanwhile, in a sign of the country's security difficulties, there were reports on Tuesday that Afghan officers had opened fire during a protest by villagers over the deaths of civilians, which they say occurred during a Nato operation. According to one report, the Afghan soldiers fired into the air, but at least one person was killed.     "
44,"During a debate at the party's national conference in Aviemore, some argued the SNP should use every opportunity to advance Scotland's interests.  But opponents narrowly won the debate, saying it would amount to a sell-out.  Nationalists also discussed plans to scrap student loans and write off graduate debt as part of a £100m package to reform student finances.  Bruce McFee, SNP MSP for West of Scotland region, said they were being asked to support an ""undemocratic bastion of privilege of the British State"".  ""To become, frankly, the political prostitutes of Scottish politics - not bought and sold for English gold but for ermine robes,"" he added.  It was suggested party leader Alex Salmond might have benefited from a change to policy, by taking up a Holyrood seat vacated by an SNP MSP compensated with a peerage.  Stewart Stevenson, MSP for Banff and Buchan, indicated during the debate that he did not want to go to the House of Lords, ending speculation that he might have stepped aside for the SNP leader.  Mr Salmond said he favoured the current stance against the Lords.  It had also been suggested that veteran Nationalist Winnie Ewing would be a candidate for the House of Lords, if the party reversed its policy.  She told the conference: ""How dare anyone suggest I have ambitions to wear ermine - or have any trappings whatsoever.""  But she argued for the Nationalists using every opportunity to advance Scottish interests.  She supported an amendment which would have allowed SNP members to sit in the Lords provided they agreed to toe the party's Westminster line.  She referred to the years when she sat as an unelected member of the European Parliament in the 1970s and said it had helped raise the profile of the SNP's point of view.  Delegates also debated plans to scrap student loans, voting overwhelmingly to replace them with means-tested grants.  The party will look at writing off the debts incurred by existing graduates.  The SNP's education spokeswoman, Fiona Hyslop, said Labour and the Liberal Democrats had let down Scotland's education system and its students.  ""A graduate currently requires an income of around £22,000 to cover the annual interest of their student loan debt, however average graduate salaries do not meet this threshold,"" she said.  ""It is no wonder that one in three of those who graduated since Labour came to power in 1997 cannot afford to start paying back their student loans.  ""People should have access to a university education based on merit rather than ability to pay.""  Party leaders have dismissed claims from rivals that the package could not be funded. They argued it was fair, just and a boost to Scotland's economic prospects.  Nationalists said it would form part of a £100m package to reform student finance arrangements."
45,"Scientists believe they have discovered a clue to why women tend to live longer than men - by studying fruit flies.  Writing in Current Biology, they focus on mutations in mitochondrial DNA - the power source of cells.  Mitochondria are inherited only from mothers, never from fathers, so there is no way to weed out mutations that damage a male's prospects.  But one ageing expert said there were many factors that explained the gender difference in life expectancy.  By the age of 85, there are approximately six women for every four men in the UK, and by 100 the ratio is more than two to one.  And females outlive males in many other species.  In the research, experts from Australia's Monash University and the UK's Lancaster University analysed the mitochondria of 13 different groups of male and female fruit flies.  Mitochondria, which exist in almost all animal cells, convert food into the energy that powers the body.  Dr Damian Dowling, of Monash University who was one of the researchers, said the results point to numerous mutations within mitochondrial DNA that affect how long males live, and the speed at which they age.  ""Intriguingly, these same mutations have no effects on patterns of ageing in females,"" he said.  ""All animals possess mitochondria, and the tendency for females to outlive males is common to many different species.  ""Our results therefore suggest that the mitochondrial mutations we have uncovered will generally cause faster male ageing across the animal kingdom.""  They suggest this is because there is no evolutionary reason for the faults that affect males to be picked up - because mitochondria are passed down by females.  Dr Dowling added: ""If a mitochondrial mutation occurs that harms fathers, but has no effect on mothers, this mutation will slip through the gaze of natural selection, unnoticed.  ""Over thousands of generations, many such mutations have accumulated that harm only males, while leaving females unscathed.""  Tom Kirkwood, professor of ageing at Newcastle University said the paper was ""intriguing"".  He said: ""It may be it does tell us something rather important about mitochondria and the difference between male and female fruit flies.  ""And we know that mitochondria are important for ageing in a number of species.  ""But I certainly don't think this is a discovery that explains why women live five-to-six years longer than men.  ""There are other things we know also count - lifestyle, social and behavioural factors. But the biggest difference in biology is that we have different hormones."""
46,"Four animals previously unknown to science have been discovered in deep water off Scotland, the Scottish government has said.  New species of large sea snail, clam and marine worm were found during surveys by Marine Scotland.  The clams and worm were at a suspected cold seep, an area where hydrocarbons are released from the seabed.  All were discovered around Rockall, the remains of a volcano 260 miles (418km) west of the Western Isles.  If confirmed, the cold seep would be the first to be discovered near Rockall. Some types of commercial fishing could be banned in the area to protect the habitat.  The new sea snail Volutopsius scotiae and clam Thyasira scotiae have been named after the research vessel MRV Scotia.  The sea snails were discovered over an area at depths of up to one mile (1.6km).  Another clam, Isorropodon mackayi, was named after mollusc expert David Mackay.  The new species of marine worm Antonbrunnia has still to be named. It is currently being examined at the National Museum Wales.  The worm was discovered by Dr Graham Oliver inside one of the clams he was confirming as a new species at his laboratory at the museum.  Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said it was surprising how the creatures had eluded scientists until now.  He said: ""Our oceans are often called Earth's final frontier and these new species prove just how much we still have to learn about this rich marine habitat.""  Mr Lochhead added: ""The area where these species were found is not currently fished and the confirmation of a cold seep is likely to result in the region being closed to bottom contact fishing.""  Jim Drewery, from Marine Scotland Science, oversaw the research on the deep water invertebrates.  He said: ""The discovery of these new species is absolutely incredible, especially when you consider that the sea snail measures a relatively large 10cm yet has gone undetected for decades.""  WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: ""These surveys highlight that we've still so much to learn when it comes to life beneath the waves.  ""Perhaps only in Scotland would you find people getting excited about something known as a 'cold seep'.  ""However, if true, then it is no less important a discovery as the much better known hydrothermal vents, found in other parts of the world. They would give us a unique opportunity to observe some species unlikely to be found anywhere else on the planet.""  Rockall is a rock in the North Atlantic just 30m (100ft) wide and 21m (70ft) high.  Earlier this year, Nick Hancock, from Ratho, near Edinburgh, was thwarted by bad weather in his attempt to spend 60 days on the rock."

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson, Arizona, will receive $1m (£625,000) each.      ""Linda's doctors were all great and managed to alleviate suffering which she might otherwise have had,"" the former Beatle said in a statement.      ""I want to help them continue that work for the benefit of others and to enable them to study the possibilities of alternative treatments.""      In keeping with the McCartneys' belief in animal welfare, none of the money will be used to fund animal research.      The gifts will fund new research on the effectiveness of botanical medicines and holistic therapies.

48,"Armed Basque separatist group Eta says it will not carry out ""armed actions"" in its campaign for independence.  In a video obtained exclusively by the BBC, the group said it took the decision several months ago ""to put in motion a democratic process"".  The Basque interior minister called the statement ""insufficient"". Madrid has previously insisted that Eta renounce violence and disarm before any talks.  Eta's violent campaign has led to more than 820 deaths over the past 40 years.  It has called two ceasefires in the past, but abandoned them both.  This latest announcement comes after the arrests of numerous Eta leaders and during an unprecedented period of debate within the Basque nationalist community over the future direction of policy, says the BBC's Clive Myrie in San Sebastian.  Eta has been coming under increasing pressure to lay down its weapons, our correspondent adds.  It is unclear whether Eta is declaring a permanent or temporary ceasefire.  In the video obtained by the BBC, three hooded Eta fighters are shown sitting behind a desk with the Eta flag pinned up behind them.  It is widely accepted that Eta is weaker than ever in its 51-year history. So to many people, Eta's retrospective ceasefire will look like an attempt to disguise its weakness as a desire for peace. Some will shrug it off as irrelevant; others will dismiss it as a way to regroup and re-arm. Eta's hope must be to negotiate the legalisation of Batasuna, and achieve its aims through the ballot box. After so many years of conflict, the government may find it difficult to dismiss Eta's call for a truce, out of hand. The pull of presiding over a moment of history might prove irresistible. But it has tried that before, and failed. This latest ceasefire declaration could mark the beginning of the end of the conflict, or just another pause in the violence.  The figure in the middle reads out a prepared statement defending Eta's campaign of violence, but towards the end she says the group now wants to achieve its aims by peaceful, democratic means.  ""Eta confirms its commitment to finding a democratic solution to the conflict,"" the statement says.  ""In its commitment to a democratic process to decide freely and democratically our future, through dialogue and negotiations, Eta is prepared today as yesterday to agree to the minimum democratic conditions necessary to put in motion a democratic process, if the Spanish government is willing,"" it says.  It adds that Eta ""took the decision several months ago not to carry out offensive armed actions"".  The statement ends: ""We call on all Basque citizens to continue in the struggle, each in their own field, with whatever degree of commitment they have, so that we can all cast down the wall of denial and make irreversible moves forward on the road to freedom.""  Eta announces that it took the decision several months ago not to carry out armed actions.  Nationalist politicians in the Basque country welcomed the announcement and called on the Spanish government and the international community to respond positively.  The pro-Eta party Batasuna, which has been banned since 2003 on the grounds that it is Eta's political wing, is one of two Basque nationalist parties to have called on Eta to declare ""an internationally verifiable ceasefire"" days earlier.  But Rodolfo Ares, the interior minister for the Basque region, called Eta's statement inadequate.  ""Any declaration that talks about the suspension of terrorist attacks - even if it is only temporary - should be considered as good news,"" he said.  But he called Eta's declaration ""ambiguous"" and ""absolutely insufficient"", because it did not ""take into account what the vast majority of Basque society demands and requires from Eta, which is that it definitively abandon terrorist activity"".  The Spanish government, which has been studying Eta's statement but is yet to make an official response, has said in the past that it will only negotiate with Eta if it renounces violence and disarms.  The deputy editor of the Basque language newspaper, Gara, which follows the activities of Eta closely, said the Basque people had been hoping for this declaration.  ""I think that it's a big step and a positive step,"" Njaki Soto told the BBC. ""I think that's it's something that the majority of the Basque society was waiting [for] or expecting and in that sense I think that it's something that no-one can say that it's negative.""  ""It will be a long way but it's something that can bring the peace and the justice to the Basque country,"" he said.  Barbara Duhrkop, a former Socialist MEP whose husband Enrique Casas was murdered by Eta in 1984, said the statement was a positive step but did not go far enough.  ""It's still insufficient because they talk about ceasefire, democratic process, but there's nothing about laying down arms and permanence. So I would be very careful, very cautious to evaluate how much worth there is in this announcement,"" she said.  Founded in 1959, Eta has since then waged a bloody campaign for independence for the seven regions in northern Spain and south-west France that Basque separatists claim as their own.  Controversial peace talks in 2006 collapsed after an Eta bomb killed two people at Madrid airport.  Correction 8 September 2010: Due to a translation error, originally we quoted Eta saying it had decided ""not to carry out armed actions""; in fact the term it used was ""offensive armed actions"""
49,"Chinese forestry firm Sino-Forest, accused last year of inflating its revenues and exaggerating the value of its timber holdings, has filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada.  The company said it would begin looking for buyers.  It also announced its intention to sue the research firm Muddy Waters that made the accusations for $4bn (£2.5bn).  Shares in Sino-Forest plunged last year following the fraud claims, which the company has strenuously denied.  In November last year, the firm said a committee had found no evidence of fraudulent activities, although observers cast doubt on the validity of its findings.  Sino-Forest said on Friday it had reached a deal with its creditors ""which would involve either a sale of the company to a third party or a restructuring under which the noteholders would acquire substantially all of the assets of the company"".  Chief executive Judson Martin said it was important the company be allowed to continue trading.  ""We believe the full value of our assets will only be achieved if we are able to continue operating the business, and repair and preserve relationships with our customers and suppliers,"" he said.  Muddy Waters did not comment on the lawsuit, but said Sino's bankruptcy protection filing vindicated its accusations.  ""This is yet another indication of what we have said all along, that Sino-Forest's management has committed a massive fraud and has deceived its shareholders and creditors,"" the firm said in a statement.  ""If the company were really generating close to $2bn in operating cash flow, it would not have had to file for a court-supervised restructuring with its creditors."""

51,"Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed while trying to stop an Israeli army bulldozer demolish a Palestinian home in the Gaza Strip in 2003, was a committed peace activist.  She was a student at Evergreen State College in her local town of Olympia in Washington State, which is known for its liberal sensibilities.  The 23-year-old arranged peace events there before joining, through local group Olympians for Peace and Solidarity, a Palestinian-led organisation that uses non-violent means to challenge Israeli army tactics in the West Bank and Gaza.  Speaking after she died in hospital on 17 March 2003 - two years before Israeli troops and settlers left Gaza - her parents paid tribute to her concern for human rights and dignity, remembering how she was ""dedicated to everybody"".  ""Rachel was filled with a love and sense of duty to our fellow man, wherever they lived, and she gave her life trying to protect those that could not protect themselves,"" her father Craig said.  Corrie's mother Cindy said her daughter had spent nights sleeping at wells to protect them from bulldozers.  ""She lived with families whose houses were threatened with demolition and today as we understand it, she stood for three hours trying to protect a house.""  Corrie had been with some eight other activists from the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement (ISM) acting as human shields in an effort to stop the demolition in the Rafah refugee camp.  The Israeli authorities said at the time that demolitions were necessary because Palestinian gunmen used the structures as cover to shoot at their troops patrolling in the area, or to conceal arms-smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.  Corrie - who was wearing an orange fluorescent jacket to alert the bulldozer drivers to her presence - had previously described the hazards of her work.  An email distributed by the ISM detailed a confrontation on 14 February between another bulldozer and her own group, which she refers to as the ""internationals"".  ""The internationals stood in the path of the bulldozer and were physically pushed with the shovel backwards, taking shelter in a house,"" she wrote. ""The bulldozer then proceeded on its course, demolishing one side of the house with the internationals inside.""  Witnesses said that on the day she died, Corrie had climbed on top of a pile of earth which lay in the path of a bulldozer.  ""The bulldozer went towards her very slowly. She was fully in clear view, straight in front of them,"" fellow activist Tom Dale said.  ""Unfortunately she couldn't keep her grip there and she started to slip down. You could see she was in serious trouble; there was panic in her face as she was turning around.""  ""All the activists there were screaming, running towards the bulldozer, trying to get them to stop. But they just kept on going,"" he added.  Richard Purssell, another activist, said: ""The driver didn't slow down; he just ran over her. Then he reversed the bulldozer back over her again.""  However, an internal investigation led by the Israeli military's chief of staff concluded within a month of Corrie's death that its forces were not to blame, that she had been hidden behind a mound of earth and the bulldozer driver had not seen her.  ""Rachel Corrie was not run over by an engineering vehicle but rather was struck by a hard object, most probably a slab of concrete which was moved or slid down while the mound of earth which she was standing behind was moved,"" it said.  While the investigators expressed sorrow for any incident in which innocent people were harmed, they felt that the ""illegal and irresponsible"" actions of the ISM ""contributed to the tragic and distressing results"".  Corrie's parents refused to accept the findings and maintained that the military's investigation had not been ""thorough, credible and transparent"", as then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had promised.  In March 2010, the family filed a civil suit in the Haifa district court against the Israeli government over the incident, accusing the military of either unlawfully or intentionally killing her or of gross negligence. The family described it as their ""absolutely last resort"".  Craig Corrie said he still believed his daughter had been seen by the driver of the bulldozer, and that the order to use bulldozers should never have been given while non-combatants were in the area.  But on 28 August, Judge Oded Gershon dismissed the civil lawsuit, ruling that Corrie's death was a ""regrettable accident"" that had been not caused by the negligence of the Israeli state or army.  He also found that there had been no fault in the internal Israeli military investigation, which cleared the driver of the bulldozer of any blame. The judge said the driver had not seen the American activist, who he said could have saved herself.  ""She did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done,"" he added. ""She consciously put herself in danger.""  He ruled that there was no justification to demand the state pay any damages, but said the Corrie family would not have to pay costs.  Afterwards, Cindy Corrie said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the verdict and that the family intended to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court.  ""I believe that this was a bad day not only for our family but a bad day for human rights, for humanity, for the rule of law and also for the country of Israel,"" she told a news conference.  ""From the beginning it was clear to us that there was a process of investigation, operational investigations, military police investigations, and it was confirmed to us today that that extends through the court system in Israel - a well-heeled system to protect the Israeli military, the soldiers who conduct actions in that military, to provide them with impunity at the cost of all the civilians who are impacted by what they do."""
52,"The first known examples of writing may have been unearthed at an archaeological dig in Pakistan.  So-called 'plant-like' and 'trident-shaped' markings have been found on fragments of pottery dating back 5500 years.  Harappa was originally a small settlement in 3500 BC but by 2600 BC it had developed into a major urban centre.  According to Dr Richard Meadow of Harvard University, the director of the Harappa Archaeological Research Project, these primitive inscriptions found on pottery may pre-date all other known writing.  Last year it was suggested that the oldest writing might have come from Egypt.  Clay tablets containing primitive words were uncovered in southern Egypt at the tomb of a king named Scorpion.  They were carbon-dated to 3300-3200 BC. This is about the same time, or slightly earlier, to the primitive writing developed by the Sumerians of the Mesopotamian civilisation around 3100 BC.  ""It's a big question as to if we can call what we have found true writing,"" he told BBC News Online, ""but we have found symbols that have similarities to what became Indus script.  One major problem in determining what the symbols mean is that no one understands the Indus language. It was unique and is now dead.  Dr Meadow points out that nothing similar to the 'Rosetta Stone' exists for the Harappan text.  The Rosetta Stone, housed in the British museum since 1802, is a large slab of black basalt uniquely inscribed with the same text in both Egyptian hieroglyphs and Greek.  Its discovery allowed researchers to decipher the ancient Egyptian script for the first time.  The Harappan language died out and did not form the basis of other languages.  What historians know of the Harappan civilisation makes them unique. Their society did not like great differences between social classes or the display of wealth by rulers. They did not leave behind large monuments or rich graves.  They appear to be a peaceful people who displayed their art in smaller works of stone.  Their society seems to have petered out. Around 1900 BC Harappa and other urban centres started to decline as people left them to move east to what is now India and the Ganges.  This discovery will add to the debate about the origins of the written word.  It probably suggests that writing developed independently in at least three places - Egypt, Mesopotamia and Harappa between 3500 BC and 3100 BC."
53,"Goddess Vanessa is a professional dominatrix. She lives in New York.  It was role play, no experience necessary, no nudity. At that point, I had a big notion of whips and chains and leather, but I don't think I really understood the psychological dynamic.  I started working at a dungeon. The formal introduction was to come in and observe. I was in for about five minutes before a lightbulb lit up, and I said to myself, ""I understand this.""  Sebastian is one of my clients. I will call him and tell him when I have time to meet with him. So if I just want to be pampered I'll tell him to come over at a specific time and he'll bring over some groceries or things that I'll need and he'll give me a foot massage.  And other times I'll be in the mood to be a bit more aggressive and to play with him, and he makes himself available to that.  We get into heavy bondage. We try different things in terms of compromising positions for a man, including hog-tied - on your knees, hands behind your back, so that your ankles and your wrists are tied together, and there's another piece of rope that comes around so that your head movement is also restricted by your ankles.  And then we get into some meditative flogging.  What's really special about Sebastian is that he's really gone beyond engaging in these practices for personal sexual gratification.  For him, it's really about the sacrifice and the service.  So when we get into heavy flogging, it's important for him to be in a sacred ritual space.  We don't engage in any verbal back-and-forth. It becomes a moment for meditation and silence and contemplation.  The only thing you usually hear is the sound of the whip on his skin.  This is not in monetary or material terms, but in terms of just setting specific goals with the individual I'm dealing with. And that translates to all spheres of my life.  I think the most concise way to define the power of a submissive is to acknowledge that submission must come from a place of power.  So in other words, the submissive doesn't have power to give if he is not self-sufficient and secure in his own ability. It's a form of chivalry.  It's like a powerful knight before his queen. A knight is a noble figure, but he lays those skills down at the feet of whomever he serves.  Dominating a man who isn't self-assured and confident in what he's giving is really a futile activity. There's nothing to be gained. There's no satisfaction in breaking somebody who's already broken, or conquering someone who's already weak.  A submissive's role as a submissive has to come from a place of power, because otherwise there's really nothing for that submissive to lay at the feet of his ruler.     It gives me a sense of self-worth, a sense of value.  I think people have a desire to feel important and to feel valuable. For myself, being able to serve someone whom I view as a perfect individual, it gives me inner validation as an individual. I don't feel humiliated doing it.  The person who rules my world, as Submissive Sebastian, is Goddess Vanessa - without a doubt.  She is the person who is on my mind during the day. And when I go to sleep I say a special prayer for her.  I have a picture of her on my cell phone, so immediately when I turn on my cell phone I see her. I have a picture of her in my wallet.  Literally, she is the person I think of all the time in my daily life. And let's say I'm going to be making a decision, I think, hmm, what would my Goddess tell me to do?  So for me definitely it would be Goddess Vanessa who runs my life. Definitely.   "

55,"The violence is the first in six days of protests by opposition supporters calling for the president to resign.  Overnight, opposition MPs held an emergency session in parliament to try to pass a new constitution to curb the president's powers.  The government called the move an ""open attempt at seizing power"".  Several people were injured in the clashes that broke out in the centre of Bishkek. Russian media reported four people had suffered gunshot wounds.  The fighting broke out as thousands of opposition supporters continued their protest close to government buildings, while a pro-government rally of several hundred got under way nearby.  Hundreds of police - some armed and others in full riot gear - encircled the centre of the city where the two demonstrations were taking place, the BBC's Natalia Anteleva reports.  They fired warning shots and used tear gas as bottles, sticks and stones were thrown by both sides.  The violence follows an emergency session of parliament called by the opposition, during which they signed a new draft constitution handing some of the president's powers to parliament.  Opposition MPs said 41 of parliament's 75 deputies signed the document, enough for a simple majority.  But it is not clear if the vote would make the document legal, as Kyrgyz law requires any changes to the constitution to have a two-thirds majority.  Constitutional Court Chairwoman Cholpon Bayekova told the Associated Press news agency that a smaller number of MPs could adopt the law as the situation was ""extraordinary"".  The government in a statement called the meeting ""nothing other than an open attempt at seizing power through anti-constitutional means"".  And President Bakiyev warned that he could dissolve parliament if the crisis continues.  ""I have not set myself the goal of dissolving parliament,"" he told a news conference.  ""But I have such a constitutional right and of course if contradictions between the legislature and the executive continues what will I have left to do? I cannot watch such an orgy.""  The opposition accuse President Bakiyev of pushing the country into a political deadlock by failing to agree to democratic reforms he promised when he was elected in March 2005.  Mr Bakiyev has urged patience, saying reforms should not be adopted in an ""hour or two"". But the opposition says his time has run out."
56,"Tunisia has voted in elections to its first parliament under a new constitution, part of political changes under way since the ""Arab Spring"".  There are no opinion polls, but the moderate Islamist Ennahda party is predicted to do well.  Turnout reached 65% an hour before the close of voting, state TV reported.  A series of democratic changes have taken place since the authoritarian leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011.  Tunisia is seen as the birthplace of the Arab Spring - the pro-democracy movement which sought to replace autocratic governments in several Arab countries.  Tunisia is considered to have had the most successful outcome, with relatively low levels of violence.  Despite a rainy and damp start to the day, there were queues outside this polling station in the Tunis 2 district, with some carrying the Tunisian flag.  In this district, voters have a choice between 45 candidates. The entire process is being tightly observed by around 800 international, as well as more than 10,000 national, election monitors across the country.  The security presence is visible at the polling stations and on the streets.  Today marks the end of the political transition period from dictatorship to democracy. It's a milestone, the expectations are high, not just in Tunisia but abroad as well.  Ennahda's main rival is likely to be the liberal Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia's Call), although it has promised to seek a coalition government even if it wins the most seats.  Most of the major parties have vowed to tackle Tunisia's high unemployment and to reinvigorate its economy.  Polls opened at 07:00 (06:00 GMT) and closed at 18:00 (17:00 GMT). Results are expected on Wednesday.  More than 50,000 security personnel and nearly 20,000 soldiers were ordered to be deployed on Sunday to ensure safe voting.  Radical groups within Tunisia have threatened to disrupt the elections and on Thursday militants shot a policeman on the outskirts of the capital, Tunis.  Casting his vote on Sunday, Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa said ""the whole world is watching Tunisia today"".  Earlier Mr Jomaa warned that extremist groups could attempt to attack polling stations.  ""We know that this [election] will be a target because it is unique in the region. It brings hope,"" he said, during an inspection of troops near Tunis.  Around five million Tunisians were registered to vote, with overseas residents having already cast their ballots on Friday.  Ennahda, which currently rules in coalition with other parties, has promised to pursue a unity government even if it wins the most seats.  Tunisia is set to hold a presidential election on 23 November, which will deliver the country's first directly elected leader since the removal of Ben Ali in 2011.  Protests which began in the Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid in late 2010 later gathered pace and spread across much of the Arab world the following year."
57,"The announcement was made after Vauxhall management and GM officials met union leaders at the factory.  Derek Simpson, the boss of Amicus, said the decision was ""another devastating blow to the car industry and UK manufacturing in general"".  The government said it would do all it could to help staff find new jobs.  The 900 job cuts represent just under a third of the plant's overall 3,000-strong workforce.  Vauxhall said it was switching from three to two shifts at the factory, which makes its Astra model.  It said the move reflected the ""ongoing pressure"" in the car industry to increase productivity and reduce costs.  Vauxhall chairman Jon Browning said the aim was to achieve the job losses at Ellesmere Port through voluntary redundancies.  ""We will, of course, work together with our labour representatives to achieve a socially-responsible solution for the affected employees,"" said Mr Browning.  ""For the people at Ellesmere Port, this is by no means indicative of a lack of progress made locally over the past several years.  ""Indeed there has been much progress. Quality and productivity have shown significant improvements, but the issue of long-term competitiveness remains.  ""We need to address this. This move will have positive effects on the cost structure of the plant.""  But Tony Woodley, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, expressed dismay at the move.  ""This plant, our industry and our country cannot afford to keep shedding skills like this,"" he said.  The 900 job losses will come into place when plant switches from three shifts to two at the end of August.  Vauxhall's parent company, GM, the biggest US car company, is also cutting 30,000 jobs in the US on the back of falling sales and profits.  Visiting Ellesmere Port ahead of the announcement, Mr Brown said he had travelled to the factory to offer any help the government could give.  ""We will do what we can to help each and every one of the workforce who may be affected by this announcement to find other jobs in the area,"" he said.  Mr Brown added that the government wished to help both the company and the workers at Ellesmere Port secure the chance to build the next Astra model.  Shadow Trade & Industry Secretary Alan Duncan attacked Mr Brown's visit to Ellesmere Port on Wednesday. ""We all know that politicians have to make visits like this one,"" said Mr Duncan.  ""But it is very hard to see what this visit can achieve for the workers at Vauxhall.  ""We fear they are being given false hope, for the sake of a photo opportunity.""  The job losses at Vauxhall are just the latest blow to the UK car industry.  Last month French car giant Peugeot Citroen announced it was closing its Ryton plant near Coventry, with the loss of 2,300 jobs.  And sports car manufacturer TVR said it was to shut its Blackpool factory, although it intends to relocate to a new site.  Those announcements followed after last year's collapse of MG Rover, with the loss of 6,000 jobs in Birmingham."
58,"As president from 1989 to 2003, Mr Jiang took the helm of the world's largest country in the wake of the Tiananmen Square killings.  When he came to power, China was a virtual pariah state. By the time he had handed the presidency over to Hu Jintao, it had become the fastest-growing economy in the world.  Mr Jiang's rise to power stemmed from a politburo purge of liberal leaders in 1989, after the ruthless suppression of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.  Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who held all the real power, needed to find a new protégé to lead the Communist Party.  Mr Jiang, who as Shanghai party chief had weathered the student protests without resorting to violence, fitted the bill.  By the time Deng finally died in February 1997, Jiang Zemin had been given enough time to establish himself.  But he also attempted to make his mark as a political thinker, alongside Mao and Deng, by expounding the three representations theory - an attempt to modernise the Party.  The theory says the Party should further the development of ""advanced social productive forces"" [allow entrepreneurs and professionals membership of the party], develop culture, and represent the majority of the people.  Jiang Zemin was born to an intellectual family and graduated as an electrical engineer. He had previously worked in a Soviet car factory and as a diplomat in Romania in the 1950s.  He served as minister in charge of the electronics industry and as mayor and party chief in Shanghai.  He likes to recite poetry and plays the piano as well as an erhu, a two-stringed instrument similar to the violin.  Former US ambassador to Beijing James Lilley recalls that Jiang was known as The Flowerpot by the people of Shanghai: ''Lots of decoration, no action.""  ""Well, it turns out he is a good consensus builder, he's a good manipulator,"" Mr Lilley said.  He has been credited with squeezing as much advantage as possible from events - such as the spy plane crisis or the Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade - but always allowing US ties to recover.  This was especially illustrated in the co-operation offered by China for Washington's ""war on terror"" following 11 September 2001.  Mr Jiang began the leadership transition to Mr Hu in November 2002, when he gave the younger man the post of party chief.  Mr Hu succeeded him as president in March 2003.  But until September 2004, Mr Jiang remained chairman of the commission which oversees China's armed forces, and retained a huge influence over foreign policy and security issues.  Mr Jiang is likely to remain fairly influential, even without an official post, because the high echelons of Chinese politics are still filled with his allies.  And Mr Jiang's supporters will work hard to protect his legacy and his family interests.  His son, Jiang Mianheng, has been called the ""Prince of Information Technology"".  The US-educated entrepreneur is chairman of the state-run China Netcom and is also in partnership with Taiwanese tycoon Winston Wong to build a $1.6 billion semiconductor plant in Shanghai."
59,"A UN tribunal has cleared Kosovo's former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj of war crimes from the 1998-99 conflict, after a retrial in The Hague.  Mr Haradinaj, a rebel commander during the war, was accused of overseeing a campaign of torture and murder against Serbs and suspected collaborators.  But four years after the last acquittal the UN court ruled again that the prosecution had not proved the case.  President Tomislav Nikolic said in a statement that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was formed ""to try the Serbian people"".  He said the verdict would increase Euroscepticism in Serbia.  Mr Haradinaj's 2008 acquittal was overturned and a retrial ordered after appeal judges ruled that there had been witness intimidation.  But the ICTY's trial chamber once again cleared Mr Haradinaj and co-defendants Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj of all charges.  The indictment alleged the three men had been involved in a joint criminal enterprise to establish Kosovo Liberation Army control in western Kosovo through detention camps.  Ethnic Serbs, Roma and Albanians who were deemed to have collaborated with Serbs were allegedly tortured and killed.  Judge Bakone Moloto said the evidence established that Serbs and their suspected supporters were beaten at a KLA compound in Kosovo, and at least one of them had died of his injuries.  However, he said there was no evidence Mr Haradinaj or his co-defendants were involved in the attacks or a conspiracy to mistreat civilians.  Mr Haradinaj, who is the most senior ethnic Albanian indicted by the ICTY, has many supporters among the Kosovo Albanian community.  He served as prime minister for 100 days before he stepped down in early 2005 to deal with his first trial.  Crowds in the capital Pristina watched the latest verdict on a giant screen, and celebrated his acquittal by letting off fireworks and cheering.  Mr Haradinaj's lawyer, Ben Emmerson, said his client now wants to restart his political career.  ""With the consent of the people, he will soon be resuming his rightful position as the political leader of the country,"" Mr Emmerson told reporters at the court.  His face is splashed across vast billboards in Kosovo, accompanied by slogans like ""the leader who keeps his word"" and ""forward with a clean slate"".  However, he is still considered a war criminal in Belgrade, and an arrest warrant has been issued against him by Serbia's war crimes prosecutor.  Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Belgrade has enlisted the support of ally Russia to block any move for international recognition.  Many Serbs feel there has been little accountability for crimes committed against them during the wars of the 1990s."
60,"Sheard gained wider fame as Admiral Ozzel in 1980 Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back.  His other films included Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade - one of a string of appearances as Adolf Hitler - and he was a regular guest in Doctor Who.  His agent said he had cancer and died at home on the Isle of Wight.  In Grange Hill, his stern manner and cries of ""You, boy"" as deputy head Maurice Bronson made him one of TV's most memorable figures.  With a series of roles in Doctor Who spanning more than 20 years, he boasted that he starred alongside more Doctors than any other actor.  He was even touted as a potential Doctor himself. ""Things got in the way,"" he told the BBC's Wiltshire website in 2003. ""It would have been fun to do.""  In Star Wars, he was memorably choked by Darth Vader - and said George Lucas told him it was ""the best screen death I've ever seen"".  At the time, Star Wars was ""just another part in a very busy actor's career"", he said, but it has secured him a place in the hearts of Star Wars fans and an Admiral Ozzel action figure came out last year.  He played Hitler five times and Himmler three times - but said playing Goering's double in sitcom 'Allo 'Allo was his worst performance.  Other film appearances included Raiders of the Lost Ark, All Quiet On The Western Front and The Dirty Dozen - Second Assignment.  He appeared alongside Dame Peggy Ashcroft in 1980 TV movie Caught on a Train and said Escape to Athena with Roger Moore was his favourite role.  Moore wrote the foreword to the first of three autobiographies, Yes, Mr Bronson: Memoirs of a Bum Actor, published in 1997.  Sheard once said he ""wouldn't have missed dear old Bronson for anything"".  ""He was scary, but as an actor Mr Bronson was a lovely part to play."""
61,"It was thought the sub-glacial lakes had been completely sealed for millions of years, enabling unique species to evolve in them.  Writing in the journal Nature, experts say international plans to drill into the lakes may now have to be reviewed.  Any attempts to drill into one body of water risks contaminating others.  ""What this paper shows is that not only could you contaminate a lake, you could contaminate the whole drainage system,"" lead author Duncan Wingham, of University College London, told the BBC News website.  The sub-glacial lakes of Antarctica are regarded as ""time capsules"" of the period when the continent began to freeze over.  The presence of the drainage system may change current thinking on the chances of finding microbial life that has evolved ""independently"".  ""The notion that these things have been sitting in the lakes evolving for millions of years probably won't wash,"" said Professor Wingham.  ""I think the idea that they have an isolated biological environment where things have gone their own way will have to be re-examined.""  Professor Martin Siegert, of the University of Bristol, a co-author of the Nature study, said there would still be a very interesting microbiological story to uncover.  ""We have always thought of sub-glacial lakes as being distinct bodies isolated from each other,"" he said.  ""For at least some of these lakes, that won't be true but they will still be isolated from the atmosphere.""  It was once thought the Antarctic continent was too cold for water to exist in liquid form beneath its frozen wastes.  More than 150 have been detected so far, but they are expected to run into thousands.  The largest underground body of water in Antarctica is known as Lake Vostok, which is 250km (155 miles) long, 40km (25 miles) wide and 400m (1,300ft) deep.  The US space agency (Nasa) and the Russian academy of sciences are planning to break through the ice to sample the water for life.  There are also proposals to explore and sample Lake Ellsworth in west Antarctica by a team involving 14 UK universities and research institutions, plus scientists from Chile, the US, Sweden, Belgium, Germany and New Zealand.  Cynan Ellis-Evans of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, said the idea of using a small lake away from Vostok to test methods would now have to be looked at again.  ""This paper indicates that lakes may well be connected at irregular time intervals and that even an apparently isolated lake can breach and transfer water hundreds of kilometres to other distant lakes so the contamination potential in relation to small lakes is greater than we'd previously thought,"" he said.  But he said evidence from examining shorelines suggested larger lakes like Vostok were relatively stable.  ""I am of the view that Vostok and other similar large lakes have developed in isolation and so the interest from a biological viewpoint will remain high.""  The latest research was carried out by scientists at the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc) Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) at UCL, the University of Bristol and University of Cambridge.  They took ultra-precise measurements of a region in East Antarctica - home to some of the oldest, thickest ice on the continent - using radars on the European Space Agency's ERS-2 satellite.  The satellite found synchronous changes in the surface height at several locations hundreds of kilometres apart.  ""To find a whole section - 30km (18 miles) by 10km (6 miles) - had dropped vertically was a great surprise,"" Professor Wingham explained.  ""We then found another similar event 300km (186 miles) away, but that bit had increased instead of decreasing.  ""We were then left with the problem of explaining what was going on. Movement of water was the only mechanism conceivable.""  The scientists believe that every so often there are large flows of water from one lake to another along rivers the size of the Thames.  Most of the time there is very little discharge, but if a lake over pressurises, a flood occurs that forces the water along the river to the next lake.  ""You could think of these things as flushing like lavatories every now and again,"" said Professor Wingham.  It was once speculated that Lake Vostok, which contains enough water to supply London for 5,000 years, may have generated huge floods that reached the coast at some point in its history.  The latest research raises the prospect that the same thing could happen again.  ""Currently, we don't know how full Lake Vostok is or the length of time it will take to fill,"" said Professor Siegert.  ""It might be thousands or even tens of thousands of years. Whether such a discharge could affect the ocean circulation around Antarctica is an open question at this stage.""  He said any discharge would probably take place over a period of months and would change sea level by less than a centimetre."
62,"Planes have begun delivering foreign aid after the violence which engulfed south Kyrgyzstan's ethnic Uzbeks.  UN refugee agency planes are landing in neighbouring Uzbekistan where some 75,000 people fled to safety before the country closed its borders.  Russian government planes have been arriving in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek carrying food and blankets.  With at least 179 deaths reported, more than a quarter of a million people are said to have fled their homes.  The true number of casualties is unknown, as many of the dead were buried without relatives registering them as having been killed. A further 1,870 people are said to have been injured.  While there were no reports of heavy fighting between Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks on Wednesday, ethnic Uzbeks in Osh threatened to blow up a city oil depot if they did not get guarantees of protection.  Kyrgyzstan's interim leaders have been struggling to impose their authority since coming to power after President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was overthrown in April.  Two UN refugee agency flights landed in the Uzbek city of Andijan carrying tents and other emergency supplies, the agency said. Four flights are to follow later this week.  The agency believes about 200,000 people are displaced within Kyrgyzstan while some 75,000 have sought safety in Uzbekistan.  ""What is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe,"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres told German radio.  Two Russian government cargo planes, each carrying 42 tonnes of aid including food and blankets, landed in Bishkek.  Pascale Meige Wagner, regional head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said there were people still trapped in their homes, including people in need of medical care, and food was running out.  The World Food Programme says it has 3,000 tonnes of food, mainly wheat flour and oil, already in Kyrgyzstan.  It would be enough to feed 87,000 people for two months, but road deliveries are hazardous amid the unrest.  Talks have been under way in Osh between Kyrgyz officials and ethnic Uzbeks holding the oil depot, which stores most of the petrol distributed in the region.  One of the Uzbeks' representatives told the BBC they no longer trusted the government and Kyrgyz military, and were hoping for UN peacekeepers to intervene.  Officials in Jalalabad, which also saw violence, say a suspected organiser of the clashes has been detained.  They say there is strong evidence that allies of Mr Bakiyev fomented the unrest.  The UN has said it believed the initial violence was ""orchestrated, targeted and well-planned"".  Ms Wagner of the Red Cross said her team on the ground was unable to judge whether ethnicity was at the root of the violence.  ""What is striking us is the level of brutality, I mean the willingness to harm and to kill, and this is really something that is extremely worrying for us,"" she told the BBC.  The government believes allies of Mr Bakiyev, who now lives in exile in Belarus, want to derail a national referendum on constitutional reform scheduled for 27 June.  A Kyrgyz government appeal for Russia to send in peacekeeping troops was rejected by Moscow.  Washington is sending its top Central Asia diplomat, Robert Blake, for meetings with officials in Bishkek on Friday and Saturday.  The clashes are the worst ethnic violence to hit southern Kyrgyzstan since the dying days of the USSR when several hundred people were killed."
63,"Q. What would the Tories have done on Viagra? What would the Conservatives do about waiting lists? (You have said they're not a useful indicator of how the NHS is performing)  A. As far as waiting lists go we've made it very clear. I have said that it is our policy that we will not measure waiting lists according to the numbers on them but according to the times people have to wait which is what concerns them most. And also I would not just have one crude time applying to every single condition, but rather that we would have specific waiting times that were appropriate to specific conditions - and the BMA support that.  As far as Viagra is concerned, our line on that was to agree with the government that it shouldn't be universally prescribed but to say that as there was already some very expensive impotence treatment available on the NHS that where this was cheaper, more effective for the patient, that it should be prescribed in those circumstances.  What we would not have done, which the government did, was provided a highly proscriptive list of when Viagra could be available, so that they've now created the very weird situation that a sufferer from multiple sclerosis can get Viagra but can't get beta-interferon - it's a bit of an Alice in Wonderland world.  You are in favour of capital punishment. If there is a miscarriage of justice how can a dead person be pardoned ? Executing people in such a planned way turns me cold, it makes me shiver. I am not soft on these issues. I believe if you murder you should N-E-V-E-R be released from prison. I also believe that murderers should be shown for at least 15 years video tapes / films and photographs of the person they murdered. I also believe that they should be forced to watch videos that are sent to prison by the relatives of the victim. I believe they should be shown a cell. Then shown the bed in corner of the cell. Tell them they are going to spend the rest of their life in that cell and they will die on that bed in the corner.  That's punishment to someone who's guilty. Believe me, they will crack. If they're innocent, they'll smile and say ""No, I'm innocent and I will prove it!""  A. I think that if you were ever to restore capital punishment, and that's extremely unlikely I have to say, then you would have to build in a lot of safeguards. For example, I think you would have to have a unanimous verdict, I don't think you could apply it to a majority verdict. I think you would also have to protect people from fabrication of evidence, making fabrication of evidence perhaps a capital offence where it led to implementation of the death penalty.  But essentially I believe the death penalty is a deterrent, I think the statistics clearly show that, I think you have a moral responsibility to the innocent to have it available to the courts.  Q. Following the Select Committee of the 25th Nov and the scathing comment by the chair of that committee that he admired the efficiency of the department but not its effectiveness do you think that more can be done to rid this country of the increasing effects of illegal drugs  A. I think you have to tackle this both at the demand and the supply end. The demand end you can only tackle through education and making people understand. But at the supply end you can do what we did which was introduce a mandatory penalty of seven year's imprisonment for the third offence of trafficking in hard drugs. And indeed because we had also implemented honesty in sentencing that seven years would have meant seven years and I regret this government has dropped honesty in sentencing.  Q. Is it possible for the NHS to remain a public service without private investment? Did the Tories start privatising the NHS?  A. We didn't in any way privatise the NHS that is a complete myth. However I do believe the NHS cannot do it all and has never done it all. The situation at the moment is creating a dispossessed - people who simply cannot get treatment. I think therefore they have to share the strain with the private sector in order that the NHS can be free to do more itself. That does mean partnership with the private sector, it doesn't mean privatising the NHS.  A. I think there has for some time been increasingly identified a gap between those who've committed a crime and should therefore go to prison, those who although they have committed a crime are deemed mentally ill and therefore go to a mental hospital and those who are a clear danger to the public but have not committed a crime and are not furthermore treatable so they cannot go to a hospital because there's nothing the hospitals can do. So, I think that gap has been increasingly causing concern and therefore I think Jack Straw was right to address the issue. I think however once you get to the point of locking people up who have done no wrong you have got to have a really robust set of safeguards. We don't know yet this time and that is what has to be tested properly.  Frank Dobson never looks me in the eyes. Why can't he look me in the eyes if he believes what he says?  I believe in the United States approach to health-care, where people are required to take out private medical insurance and where there is no National Health Service. The benefit of this is that the average person is taxed less by central government because they do not have to contribute to a service which everybody does not use. A similar system could also be used for tolling on motorways. Why should 'everybody' pay for using highways, when, say, they do not even own a car?  Do you believe, and does the Conservative Party believe, that a privately-managed health system would be fairer to the British people, and only those who really need medical help should pay for it. It seems ludicrous that everybody pays for a system, which only a handful of people use regularly.  A. I am not suggesting for one moment that you should replace the NHS with a privately-managed system, what I want to do is add on to the existing system. I have committed the Conservative Party to spending more in real terms year on year on the NHS, as we did throughout the last government. But it's what you do on top of that which matters. I want to add on a huge extra area of spending, not replace one with the other.  Do you agree that the Tory party it is too early and should refrain from establishing any base line policy on key issues?  A. It is certainly to early to make detailed policy announcement. If you remember Neil Kinnock, he made a policy announcement almost every fortnight. He ended up locked into an entirely inappropriate agenda, which rebounded against him heavily when it came to the election. I don't think we should do that. Our agenda has got to be relevant to the time the election is fought. But that doesn't mean we can't make some policy pronouncements and doesn't mean we can't be working on policy and we are working very hard.  Q. Is a two-tier health service inevitable? Did the Conservatives make it so? If people live to 130, how do you propose the UK health service copes with the increased demand? Can the NHS offer care to everyone who needs it?  A. Look, we have a three-tier health system in this country at the moment. The first tier are those who can either get NHS treatment or choose quite voluntarily to go to the private sector. They're on the top tier. On the second tier are those who are denied NHS treatment, either because of successive delay or because it's just not available, and they can go private but sometimes at immense cost. We've had examples of people selling their houses to buy beta-interferon, but nevertheless they find a way. But on the third tier, are the totally dispossessed people who are denied NHS treatment - even if they gave up eating they wouldn't be able to afford any alternative. So the idea that we are moving towards a two-tier NHS is nonsense. We have a three-tier one already operating and presided over by this government.  I am writing to seek your party's views on gulf war syndrome. I have returned from the AGM of the gulf war vets at Portsmouth, after being very much enlightened from a talk from a nuclear biologist by the name of DR Durokovic. The gentleman in question has tested 21 gulf war vets for depleted uranium poisoning. All 21 vets have returned positive results. The doctor has himself worked for the US government and was told to cease his research into depleted uranium, he refused and was then dismissed. Since then he has been conducting his own research into the matter, with as stated positive results. He has also been dropped from speaking at the world C.D.C conference in Atlanta U.S.A .  It would appear certain agencies would like him to be quiet. I strongly admire you and the conviction you have in something you believe RIGHT. PLEASE HELP OUR CAUSE ... and please would you raise the issue in the Commons  A. My view is that this is something that has to be established by the medical profession. It isn't for the government to say, there is or there isn't Gulf War syndrome. It is for it to be established and for a government to then decide what it should do.  What will the Conservatives do about preventing future food health scares - I am particularly concerned about the safety of genetically modified foods.  A. On genetically-modified food we have an extremely strong stand and William Hague has made this a big issue at Prime Minister's Questions. As far as we're concerned, the recommendation of English Nature, which is the government's own advisory body on the subject, is that there should a moratorium of several years while we see exactly what genetically-modified foods are leading to and what the effects will be. I think it is profoundly ill-advised to rush in and I don't understand why the prime minister is rushing in.  I'm glad William Hague was ahead of everybody else - it was happening without everybody else being aware of it. It's certainly is something, among many other things, we are taking a lead on.  Q. Will the Tories support legislation allowing Health Authorities to invest money in keeping vulnerable people warm in their homes, so that they do not fall ill during the cold winter months.  A. We always did throughout our time in office, so there's nothing new about that.  Q. How can anyone take the Tories seriously on health? having caused the crisis in nursing recruitment, they criticise the Government for not increasing their pay by enough? It takes three years to train a nurse so any current crisis in nurses recruitment HAS to have been caused by the last Government?  A. That's absolute and utter nonsense and it really worries me when the debate gets down to that level. 'Ann, it's all your fault,' like kids in the playground. The truth is that we increased nurses by over 55,000 during our term in office. This government reduced the nurses in training by 3% when they came in - those are the facts. This government came in promising another 15,000 nurses and suddenly found there isn't a magic wand. Until we have a rational debate about the fact we have a service where demand has gone well ahead of supply, where expectation is dragging that demand ahead of supply - until we start having an intelligent debate we will never make progress.  Two of my friends live in the flat beneath yours (number 8). Have you ever met them? If not, you should go and say hello, particularly as one is a nurse with a new baby. Could be useful for a health spokesperson.  A. If they're the girls in Number 8 I already have.  How do you, and others in parliament, justify attempting to enforce your religious & moral beliefs on others by voting against & generally opposing abortion. Surely the right and decision of a women to decide what happens to her body is hers and hers alone.  A. Abortion is not just a religious belief. Some of my best work against abortion was done when I was an agnostic. It is not moral issue - if I come up and kill you, you do not say it's a moral, individual issue. We are talking about taking life in the womb. Our laws now permit abortion up to birth itself. That means you can have two children in the womb, one of whom is protected and born with every civil liberty that there is and the other of whom is not wanted and can actually be aborted at the same age and gestation as the other child. That is profoundly wrong and it has nothing to do with sexual morality, or religion, or anything else.  Here is my questions to Ann Widdecombe: What is your point of view as far as the House Of Lords reform is concerned ?  A. I think that what is happening at the moment is utterly irresponsible. We have a situation where the government is abolishing one part of the House of Lords without telling us what they are going to put in its place. Now I think that is unacceptable. If you're going to reform the House of Lords that is perfectly valid, but you must say what you're going to do.  I shall be grateful if you could ask Ann Widdecombe whether she seriously believes that the Conservative Party stand the slightest chance of winning general elections in the next ten to 15 years.  A. Yes, I think we can win the election in two years time. There is some profound misconception around that they got a record number of votes in 1997. They didn't - they got fewer votes than we got in 1992. A lot of those majorities that they have in the House of Commons are very fragile and will go in the first whiff of adverse wind.  Q. Should the Government not be pressed to answer the infamous ""West Lothian question"", before the opening of the Scottish Parliament later this year? Many Unionists, myself included, fear that Labour's short sighted devolution policy is likely to lead to Scottish independence - and the end of the Union, and our country as we know it!  A. I think the government is ducking and dodging and diving and weaving on the West Lothian question, but eventually they will have to face it.  Q. Who does your hair?  A. Stage Door at Strutton Ground. Why do you wish to avoid them in future.  Q. Do you not feel that it is too easy for someone of your beliefs and, shall we say, limited experience to damn young girls who choose to have abortions? While abortion is a horrible and regrettable thing, I could not bring myself to condemn girls that I know (and those that I don't) for having taken what must be an awful decision.  A. As I've never condemned anybody it's an irrelevant question.  I would like to ask you where you stand on the Age of Consent for homosexuals. It has become a hot topic, and the Common's is littered with both supporters and objectors. I would like to hear what your opinion is, and why you feel your stand is so important, whatever your view.  A. I believe it should remain at 18. It's a free vote and I do differ from William Hague on that point.  Q. Having listened to your Conference speech in Bournemouth last year, as well a talking to other members of the Party, you are a favourite to be a future leader of the Party and even PM.  Do you have any ambitions to be PM and what Cabinet post would you like to have most ?  A. I think that pretty well everyone in the House of Commons at times nurtures ambitions to be prime minister but there is such a thing as reality and I just live for each day. I don't worry about the future, I do have colleagues who are so, so worried about each next reshuffle that they don't actually enjoy the year in between them. I've never been in that category.  I'm finding it difficult to see your reasoning why it is wrong to have abortion yet right to have capital punishment. Regarding the latter one can sight passages in The Bible - eye for an eye? - and yet that could be balanced by He who has not sinned cast the first stone. Anti-Abortion and capital punishment run counter to each other, don't they?  A. I believe that there is only ever one circumstance when it is right to take life and that is to save life. I explained earlier that capital punishment is a deterrent and therefore it saves lives. The one occasion where I would not outlaw abortion is where the mother's life in danger because then you have a choice between lives. Similarly I'm not a pacifist, I think every country has a choice to kill in its own defence.  Q. Your views on morality are a long way out of line with those of your deputy, Alan Duncan. How do the two of you work together, and what do you argue about?  A. We work together very well because we're grown-ups.  Q. Would you say our society has entered an 'information age'? If so, in what areas, and to what extent, do you think it is changing the way we live?  A. Yes, I think we are very much so and the changes are both for the good and the bad. On the one hand the information age is wonderful, you touch a button on the Internet and you get all the information you could require on the most obscure subject if you know where to go.  On the other hand, I think the technology that goes with it is a two-edged sword in many ways. First of all I think there is a diminution of reading. I am quite alarmed by the number of tiny tots coming into surgeries with no conversational skills but very good with the screens. And that's even happening in my leafy prosperous part of the world, you know, it's by no means something that just happens where people don't have parenting skills.  But on the whole I think most of us would have to say the new technology is a great thing for the world.  I read that on Christmas day you visited a number of hospitals and also a shelter for the homeless. How do you reconcile your religious beliefs and your care for those less fortunate than yourself, particularly the homeless, with the fact that you are a prominent member of a party which oversaw a three fold increase in the number of homeless people at the same time as we become on of the worlds largest exports of oil , or the fact that we have less doctors (per head) than almost any other country in Europe ?  A. There was a large increase in the number of homeless throughout Europe. It goes back to my point about childish politics. The British Conservative Party did not create rising homelessness but there it was. We were always very concerned about homelessness. One of the schemes that we backed was the new Foyers, which combined tackling homelessness and employment combined.  How ambitious are you?  A. I'm moderately ambitious but I don't get hung up about the next reshuffle. My line is that I shall get as far as God decides, no farther.  Do you think that the gay community should enjoy the same rights and privileges as the rest of society? If their are limitations on their citizenship, should they then be expected to contribute as much in taxes as a heterosexual?  A. I certainly think that there should not be the situation there was before the '68 that merely to be homosexual exposed you to blackmail. I think it wrong that there should be overt discrimination. Where I differ is that I do not think that it can be promoted as an equally valid lifestyle to marriage, but I would say the same about irregular heterosexual arrangements.  Q. I know this isn't really a terribly political question but it's something I've often wondered...  You stand out from the rest of the Conservative Party partly by virtue of your excellent sense of humour.  1) Who writes the one-liners that go into your speeches?  2) Who are your favourite comedians?  A. Rory Bremner is certainly my favourite comedian and I still roar with laughter at 'Allo 'Allo. But as far as the one-liners in my speech go, some of them just come off the cuff, some I've thought up and some are suggested to me by assistants, by friends by others, sometimes I hear them used in a different context and straightforwardly pinch them.  Q. Section 28 prevents local authorities from raising awareness of gay health issues in the community, but does not apply to colleges of further education (who of course are outside the administrative and financial control of LAs). Despite this, many FE colleges prevent their welfare services/students' unions from running gay-health campaigns, citing Section 28 as their reason. Do you agree that FEs that do use Section 28 are wrong (both legally and morally) and do you think that MPs should repeal the legislation for the sake of public health.  A. No I don't think it should be repealed at all. I think it is wrong to promote those sort of lifestyles and the accent is on promote. I think you have to have a preferred model.  I know it's not your shadow job. However, I am concerned at the new law Mr Straw wishes to bring in, ie, curbing the press when there is an incident involving a minor. It is not the fact that the victim will remain anonymous (I think it is a good idea), it is the fact that the perpetrator or criminal will also go un-named when it is in the public interest. Am I right in thinking this will be the case? If so I think the Govt. is inadvertently protecting the criminal. What are your thoughts?  A. I think the minor should remain anonymous but I think there are arguments for and against actual curbs on the press rather than trying to do this through ad hoc court rulings. I think the devil is very much in the detail.  Q. Miss Widdecombe I have the greatest respect for your battle over abortion not only on behalf of the unborn, but also for the Doctors and Nurses who feel called into medicine as a vocation but not its moral maze.  Only a small percentage must train with any moral or religious backing these days to cope with not only practice , but the inevitable tragedies. I cannot help feeling politicians would do well to serve in a hospital for a week and grasp the manning problems not just the figures - and of course some patient s will be more gracious than others.  Mr. Dobson is now currying electoral favour over fertility - this too is fundamentally wrong - babies have a way of coming when they are meant to, not on demand or in bottles. I am sorry that it was during the Conservative period in power hospital training went down hill so badly, there was too much theory and not enough hands on training, plus the standard of general education had slowly gone down hill. I recall cautioning one trainee Doctor with the warning that 4 patients would present the same problem, with one it could be a generational thing, with another their time to be healed, one would have a wrong attitude and she could lose one, she was a Doctor not God.  YOU OF ALL PEOPLE MUST UNDERSTAND the relationship between spiritual health and physical well being. As one of the same generation as yourself, I feel the whole ethos of public life has slipped and will not now lend itself to trite political posturing, nor can some of your colleagues claim any moral high ground. If Politicians will not roll their sleeves up on the ground floor how on earth do they expect to be taken seriously, and as for writing books of questionable literary merit to get a footing in parliament. If the literature is not elevating I doubt the man or woman who wrote it is, so why should they expect to be allowed to govern.  A. We had an examination into this some time ago when I sat on the Select Committee on health and social services in about 1990. We found as a committee that it was very difficult to implement the conscience clause. Theoretically under the '67 act, if you have a conscientious objection to abortion you don't have to carry it out. In practice, it is almost impossible to be a consultant and refuse to carry our abortions and all health authorities now provide abortion automatically.  This is why I'm so afraid of any extension into voluntary euthanasia. You'd put in a conscience clause and in 10 years time you wouldn't be able to get into geriatrics unless you believed in it.  Q. Who do you think will be the next Conservative Prime Minister?  What are your views on the opinion that some of us are tired of politicians, past and presents, taking the stance that whenever the then government proposes something (presumably for the benefit of society as a whole) the role of opposition politicians is to rubbish what has been announced and complain about how it should be done. Surely politicians in government make a few good decisions that opposition should applaud.  A. I think this goes back to much of what I've been saying. I am tired of the sort of politics that simply trades blame and statistics rather than tries to address questions. It is however the role of an opposition party to test everything the government is doing to destruction. That therefore means that you do have to look for the fault, you do have to magnify the fault in order to have it debate and that is a valid role of opposition and I never objected to it when we were in government.  After all let us consider this - when there has been the greatest consensus among politicians there has also been the greatest disaster. In recent memory, we can all remember the collapse of the ERM, the devastating effect that had on the British economy and individual lives, causing people to lose their business, their houses and goodness knows what else. And yet the ERM was agreed by all three major political parties. That should warn us that opposition has a very valuable democratic function to perform.  It does have its advantages. When you're in government you spend a lot of time managing today's crisis, firefighting. When your in opposition you can go back to the drawing board and you can work out where you'd like to be and how on earth you get there from where you are at the moment, which is the real challenge."
64,"Harold Wilson's belief that he was the victim of a secret service plot to discredit him is well documented.  But new revelations in BBC drama documentary The Plot Against Harold Wilson, to be broadcast next Thursday, suggest the Labour prime minister was also convinced he was the target of plans to stage a military coup - and that the Royal Family backed it.  The story sounds barely credible - a sign, perhaps, that Wilson was suffering from paranoia - but it is backed up by corroborating interviews with other senior figures from the time.  The then BBC journalist Barrie Penrose has outlined some of the detail of the new evidence in an article in this week's Radio Times.  He stresses the need to bear in mind the backdrop to the alleged plots, telling the magazine: ""Our establishment, from the intelligence services down to parts of Fleet Street, were paranoid about the threat of communism. So paranoid it seems, they were prepared to believe a prime minister of Britain was an active Soviet spy.""  At a time of continuing Cold War tensions, industrial unrest was rife, the country had suffered power cuts and a three day working week and in 1975 the government was being warned privately that the economy faced ""wholesale domestic liquidation"" unless it could tame inflation.  While some on the hard left believed revolution was imminent, former military figures angry at the extent of union control were building private armies, in preparation for the coming conflict.  And it is these mercenaries, the programme says, that Wilson feared would be used to stage a coup against him - and that the British army might not come to his aid.  In his book Spycatcher, Peter Wright tells of a plot to force Wilson's resignation by MI5 agents convinced he was a Communist spy. Wright's account is often dismissed as an exaggeration, but the drama documentary claims fresh evidence of plots.  The meetings with Wilson the programme is based on were secretly recorded in 1976 by journalists Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour, weeks after his shock departure from Number 10.  ""Wilson spoke darkly of two military coups which he said had been planned to overthrow his government in the late 1960s and in the mid 1970s,"" Penrose writes.  ""Both were said to involve high-ranking elements in the British army, eager to see the back of Labour governments.  ""Both involved a member of the Royal Family - Prince Louis Mountbatten.""  Lord Mountbatten would be installed as an interim prime minister following the military coup, Wilson believed.  Baroness Falkender, Wilson's political secretary, also told the two journalists about her belief military coups had been planned and that she and Wilson would be arrested with the rest of the Labour cabinet, Penrose writes in the Radio Times.  ""Unbeknown to Wilson, Courtiour and I secretly recorded many of our meetings with him, almost always conducted at his Georgian house at 5 Lord North Street, close to the House of Commons,"" Penrose says.  ""The cumbersome machine was smuggled into his study in a briefcase carried by Courtiour. Over a period of nine months we accumulated hours of tape recordings. Those tapes have, since then, remained untouched in the loft of my Kent home and at Courtiour's London home.""  Wilson told the journalists they ""should investigate the forces that are threatening democratic countries like Britain"".  They were also startled to be told at their first meeting with him: ""Occasionally when we meet I might tell you to go to the Charing Cross Road and kick a blind man standing on the corner. That blind man may tell you something, lead you somewhere.""  The pair were never asked to go to Charing Cross Road but Wilson went on to tell them about his distrust of a group of MI5 officers, who he said were trying to smear him by planting stories in the press about him being an adulterer and a Communist spy.  In one of the secretly recorded tapes Wilson says: ""I am not certain that for the last eight months when I was prime minister I knew what was happening, fully, in security.""  New witnesses interviewed for the programme talk about these military coups and Mountbatten's role in them. Penrose says they confirm such plotting ""wasn't in the fevered imagination of an embittered ex-PM"".  Penrose concludes his Radio Times article: ""You may ask, at the end of the programme, how much of it can be believed. My view now, as it was then, is that Wilson was right in his fears.... in answer to the question 'how close did we come to a military government' I can only say - closer than we'd ever be content to think.""

65,"HMS Vanguard is the Trident submarine currently on patrol One of Britain's four Trident submarines is always out there, somewhere under the Atlantic, carrying more destructive power than was unleashed in the entire campaign of World War II. It moves through the deep: silent, undetectable, untouchable. This is Britain's nuclear deterrent and the logic is simple: whatever happens to the mainland, even if it's utterly destroyed in a surprise attack, that lone submarine will always be ready and able to strike back with overwhelming force. For a BBC Radio 4 documentary, The Human Button, we were given unprecedented access to Britain's nuclear weapons infrastructure in order to answer three basic questions: How does the system work? What's it like to be a part of it and is it fail-safe? Safeguards are built into the system from top to bottom. Two men (and so far they have always been men) are needed to authenticate each step of the process from the government emergency room somewhere under Whitehall, where the prime minister's decision to fire would most likely be taken. It would be relayed to the CTF 345 bunker at the Northwood facility in Middlesex, through which the command is passed on to the submarine on patrol and to the missile control centre on board that submarine itself. I think the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite sure that that order was not obeyed    Lord Guthrie, former chief of the defence staff But what would happen if the prime minister requested a strike for which, in the minds of his advisors, there was no justification? In other words, can the system protect against a PM who, in a period of rapidly escalating international tension, loses it? Under our unwritten constitution that question has never been satisfactorily answered - until now. Lord Guthrie, who as chief of the defence staff briefed the newly-elected Tony Blair on the system in 1997, says the ultimate fail-safe is the fact that the head of the armed services is not the prime minister, but the Queen. ""I think the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite sure that that order was not obeyed. ""And I think you have to remember that actually prime ministers give direction, they tell the chief of the defence staff what they want, but it's not prime ministers who actually tell a sailor to press a button in the middle of the Atlantic. ""The armed forces are loyal, and we live in a democracy, but actually their ultimate authority is the Queen."" The prime minister can sack the chief of the defence staff. But only the Queen can approve the appointment of a new one. Is that the fail-safe? ""You could say that,"" says Guthrie. ""He might find a more pliable one, I suppose. I suspect during the time when he was hunting around for a new chief of the defence staff, common sense would prevail."" It's one thing for the chief of the defence staff to refuse to obey a prime ministerial instruction, but what if someone further down the firing chain felt they simply couldn't go through with it? Toby Elliott was commander of the Polaris (the precursor to Trident) submarine HMS Resolution in the 1980s. He says he knew men who doubted their own resolve. They were, in effect, punished for it. ""I knew several of my colleagues who went through the commanding officers' course and who were then selected to command Polaris submarines who said they couldn't do it,"" says Elliott. ""They were very brave to do so. In some cases they lost their sea-going appointment and effectively ended their Naval careers."" Was that because there weren't other boats for them to command? ""No,"" says Elliott, ""it was because they turned down the opportunity, or the invitation, to command a Polaris submarine - because they had doubts about their ability to carry out the ultimate act."" Commander Richard Lindsey is the captain of HMS Vanguard, the Trident submarine on patrol right now. He says his men would not be there if they couldn't go through with it. ""I'm sure that if somebody was on board who did not want to be here, they would have followed a process of leaving the submarine service or finding something else to do in the Navy,"" he says. Doubts about the job, Lindsey explains, are more likely to focus on the rigours of the patrol. ""The doubt might not be placed just purely on the deterrent, the doubt can be placed in terms of the personal commitment by being away from home - the nil communication process. Out of the armed forces, there are only going to be approximately 160 people who have no communication at all with their families."" Ultimately, the system - for all its complex mechanisms - relies on individuals to make it work. Very few people in the history of the world have held anything like the degree of responsibility that those individuals hold. The destructive power they could unleash, if called upon to do so, is unimaginable. But be assured: the fail-safes are many and they are almost certainly fool-proof - even if the prime minister goes berserk. The Human Button is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday 2 December and again on Sunday 7 December at 17:00.     "
66,"More than 25 people have been killed during a vicious gun battle in Mexico City just days before the Olympic Games are due to begin.  Thousands of students had gathered for a meeting organised by the National Strike Council in La Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco to protest against the military occupation of the National Polytechnic Institute.  The protesters, many of whom were women and children, had been planning to march through a working-class suburb of the city, but by early evening military personnel in armoured vehicles had surrounded the square.  The Mexican government say ""agitator groups"" among the students began shooting at the crowds from buildings, which resulted in a 90-minute gun fight.  General Marcelino Garcia Barragan, Mexico's defence minister said the army began firing into the crowd in self-defence after they found themselves targets of sniper fire from buildings in the square.  But several eye-witnesses claim the army entered the square in seven or eight armoured tanks and began shooting first.  After the fighting had subsided dozens of bodies lay strewn across the square, many more were injured.  More than 500 people have been arrested.  The violence follows weeks of demonstrations by students demanding democratic reform and social justice. They have used the international focus on Mexico City because of the Olympics to promote their message.  In September, President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, in a bid to suppress the protests and cause minimum disruption to the Olympics, ordered the military occupation of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City.  At this stage it is not clear whether the 7,000 athletes, currently preparing for the Games 11 miles away from Tlatelolco in the Olympic Village, are in danger. It is the first time the Olympics have been held in a Latin American country.  Lord Exeter, British vice-president of the International Olympic Committee told the Times: ""The riots have nothing to do with the Olympic Games. The students are not protesting against the games but against the Mexican government."""
67,"But the team finishing third in the Premier League will now go straight into the group stages and the fourth team will face two qualifying rounds.  There will also be more places for champions of lower ranked nations if the proposals are ratified next month.  And this will mean a place in the group stage for Scotland's champions in 2009.  But with fewer spots available for qualifiers the team finishing fourth in the Premier League will now face a tougher qualification process.  Platini's most controversial proposal was for domestic cup winners to play off for the places that currently go to the teams finishing fourth in the top European leagues, but this idea has been dropped.  Platini had outlined his plans to Uefa's European Professional Football Strategy Council, a 16-member group comprising of officials from Europe's leagues, associations and clubs in Nyon, Switzerland.  The new changes will be ratified at Uefa's executive committee meeting in Lucerne on 1 December.  BBC sports editor Mihir Bose said: ""Platini wanted the new club champions to come in from the less privileged parts of Europe.  ""He has got that part of the plan through - six new clubs will come in.  ""But the other part of the proposal, which involved the cup winners, has been completely abandoned.""  The meeting's other significant outcome was the automatic qualification of the team finishing third in the top leagues, including the Premier League.  ""The Premier League has won a thumping victory over Platini,"" added Bose.  The plan had been opposed by the G14, the body which represents 18 of Europe's leading clubs including Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal, who said any change would devalue the reputation of the Champions League.  Their view was backed by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.  ""You have to be careful not to change the Champions League too much by bringing in even more weaker teams because you could find yourself with games with no meaning,"" he said.  ""That would be very dangerous for the quality of the competition."""
68,"Where did the Vikings come from? The Vikings came from three countries of Scandinavia: Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The name 'Viking' comes from a language called 'Old Norse' and means 'a pirate raid'. People who went off raiding in ships were said to be 'going Viking'. The Viking age in European history was about AD 700 to 1100. During this period many Vikings left Scandinavia and travelled to other countries, such as Britain and Ireland. Some went to fight and steal treasure. Others settled in new lands as farmers, craftsmen or traders.  Southern Britain (England) had been settled by the Anglo-Saxons. You can find out more on our Anglo-Saxons site. In AD 787 three Viking longships landed in southern England. The Vikings fought the local people, then sailed away. This first raid is recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. It was the start of a fierce struggle between English and Vikings. The English called the Viking invaders 'Danes' but they came from Norway as well as Denmark. Norwegian Vikings or 'Norse' sailed to Scotland, where they made settlements in the north and on the Orkney and Shetland islands. Vikings also settled on the Isle of Man. Vikings raided Wales, but few made homes there.  In 793 Vikings attacked the Christian monastery at Lindisfarne in Northumbria. They were pagans, not Christians like most people in Britain. A Viking robber did not think twice about robbing a Christian church. Christian monasteries in Britain were easy to attack, because the monks in the monasteries had no weapons. Churches and monasteries kept valuable treasures, such as gold, jewels and books. There were food, drink, cattle, clothes and tools too - tempting for greedy Vikings.  Some Viking ships brought families to Britain looking for land to farm. Good farmland was scarce in the Vikings' own countries. The parts of Britain where most Vikings settled were northern Scotland and eastern England. For 500 years, from about AD 900, Vikings ruled the north of Scotland, the Orkney and Shetland isles and the Hebrides islands off the west coast. In Ireland, Vikings founded the city of Dublin. Viking areas in east and northern England became known as the Danelaw. Viking settlements brought new words into the English language, and new ideas about government too. For a short time England had Danish kings (King Cnut and his sons, from 1016 to 1042).  How far did Vikings roam? Norwegian Vikings sailed west across the Atlantic Ocean to Iceland and Greenland. About AD 1000, Vikings sailed to North America and started a settlement, though it did not last long. Danish Vikings went to France and founded Normandy ('Land of the North-men'). Danish Vikings also sailed south around Spain, and into the Mediterranean Sea. Swedish Vikings roamed along rivers into Russia. Viking traders could be found as far east as Constantinople (Turkey), where they met people from Africa, Arabia and Asia."
69,"A booklet produced in 1987 told Soviet soldiers how to behave in Afghanistan. The last Soviet soldier left Afghan territory on 15 February 1989. ""The Internationalist soldier must always hold high the honour of the Soviet citizen."" ""The Internationalist soldier is forbidden to enter into unsanctioned relationships!"" In fact, while soldiers admitted that it was easy to fall into a trap, few avoided social contact with locals. Soldiers ""must never visit"" local shops or stalls. According to accounts, anything from Japanese watches to machine guns were on sale, and while alcohol was rare, hashish was easy to buy. ""The Internationalist soldier should not undress, sunbathe or swim in the presence of local people... because such behaviour... is considered offensive."" Soldiers were forbidden from looking at the faces of women or from starting conversations with them. The pamphlet said soldiers must not take gifts and bribes from local leaders. Soldiers said sometimes it was difficult to refuse them. Soldiers must ""observe a regime of secrecy"" and be careful who was listening, the pamphlet said. Many Afghans spoke good Russian, although they often tried not to show it.     "
70,"Prior to the outbreak of bridge-building that occurred in the 19th Century, it was not uncommon for the River Thames to freeze over. One of the earliest recorded occasions was in AD 250 when the river remained under ice for nine weeks. During the 'Little Ice Age', which is usually dated around 1500 - 1850 AD, the whole of Northern Europe experienced markedly cooler conditions and as a result the river froze more frequently.  The process required a long spell of cold, dry weather. Ice patches would initially form near banks and bridges, and grow until they formed solid areas of ice. These would eventually meet up until the river surface was frozen. When the ice was perceived to be thick enough, people would venture onto the ice to hold frost fairs - carnivals on ice that involved dancing, winter games and, most importantly, drinking. It was not uncommon for the freeze to last over three months, as in the case of the winters of 1683 - 1684 and 1715 - 1716.  In 1434, 1506 and 1575 the ice was thick enough to allow people to abandon bridges and drive their carts and carriages across the ice , but there was little in the way of organised entertainment or celebration. The earliest recorded frost fair was in 1564 - 1565, when people congregated on the ice to take part in a football match, archery contests, dancing and feasting. The second similar fair was in 1608 and is depicted in the novel Orlando by Virginia Woolf. It too was unorganised and spontaneous, but the fair of 1683 - 1684 was very different. It lasted from December to early February and was much bigger, creating a mini-London on the ice. Whole streets of booths were constructed across the river between Southwark and Temple, with different trades occupying different areas of the fair. London's entertainments were replicated and Londoners could pass their time drinking watching bear- or bull-baiting, wrestling and horseracing on the ice. Printing presses created souvenirs for visitors and a whole ox was roasted at Hungerford Stairs. Charles II visited, accompanied by his court, and the printed souvenir created for him can be seen at the Museum of London.  The fair of 1814 is the best known and biggest of all London's frost fairs. The freezing process started at the beginning of January after a period of unseasonably mild weather and a week-long fog. The temperature dropped dramatically and, by the end of the month, the ice was thick enough for about 70 brave souls to venture from one bank to the other. Once people realised that the ice between Blackfriars Bridge and Three Crane Stairs was strong enough to hold their weight, they ventured out in their thousands.  By the next day, London traders, who had always been quick to make a penny or two, had turned the whole area into a fair. Rather than the stalls and booths going across the Thames, they ran down the middle and this mall was named the 'City Road'. At first the stalls were quite simple, either selling warming drinks, often alcoholic despite the lack of a licence, or providing a variety of amusements. They were quickly joined by nine printing presses creating frost fair memorabilia. A sheep was roasted on the ice and spectators were charged just to look at it; after it was cooked it was sold as 'Lapland mutton'. As the fair attracted more Londoners, the range of products and activities grew and people clamoured for souvenirs that were marked with 'Frost Fair 1814' and 'Bought on the Thames'. By the end of the week a small herd of donkeys were tempted onto the ice to give rides.  The ice continued to hold, though at the edges there were weak spots. 'Watermen' had to rescue two women who fell through the ice, although a lead-laden plumber who had attempted to cross the ice was, unsurprisingly, less lucky. When the thaw did come, it came quickly. A week after the river had frozen, three people had to be rescued from a large piece of ice that had broken away and by the next day the rise in temperature was indicated by a shower of sleet. This later turned to rain and the ice started to become unstable, sweeping two men down the Thames. The tidal action of the Thames returned and by Sunday huge cracks were appearing in the ice surface. Within 24 hours the ice was quite gone and the river flowing as usual, though the cold weather lasted until late March.  1814 was to prove to be last fair. A new London Bridge was built in 1823 slightly upstream from the old bridge which was eventually demolished in 1831. The structure of the new bridge was less bulky then its predecessor, which had acted as a dam. The demolition of the latter and the narrowing of the river through the creation of the embankments on either side permanently changed the flow of the river. The Thames is now too fast-flowing to freeze over, though there were plans to freeze it as part of the Millennium celebrations using modern technology. The two methods suggested both involved a system of underwater pipes to keep the surface frozen. It was suggested that chemicals could be used to lower the temperature of the river. However, objections were received from the Port of London Authority who were worried about the effect on commercial activity on the river."
71,"      Aspects of Iain Duncan Smith's CV, relating to his education, are inaccurate and misleading, an investigation by BBC Newsnight reveals.    The investigation into the Conservative Party leader's education and early career - broadcast at 10.30pm on BBC TWO last night (Wednesday 18 December 2002) - was presented by Michael Crick, author of the best-selling biography of Jeffrey Archer.    If any of the following material is used BBC Newsnight must be credited.       Iain Duncan Smith's biography on the Conservative Party website, his entry in Who's Who, and various other places, state that he went to the Universita di Perugia in Italy.    This is not true: his office now admit that he went to the Universita per Stranieri, which is also in Perugia.    The Universita per Stranieri - or University for Foreigners - was founded in 1921 and is a totally separate institution to the medieval Universita di Perugia, founded by the Pope in 1308.    Although the Universita per Stranieri is a respected language school, it did not grant degrees when he studied there in 1973, although some students attained diplomas.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now admitted to Newsnight that he didn't get any qualifications in Perugia or even finish his exams.       The first line of Iain Duncan Smith's biography, on the Conservative Party website, claims he was ""educated at Dunchurch College of Management"".    In fact, Dunchurch was the former staff college for GEC Marconi, for whom he worked in the 1980s.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now confirmed to Newsnight that he did not get any qualifications there either, but that he completed six separate courses lasting a few days each, adding up to about a month in total.    Newsnight has now spoken to 19 former tutors at Dunchurch. Most agree it is over-emphasising his experience at Dunchurch to describe it in the way he does.    John Garside, a former Dunchurch tutor, says: ""I'm puzzled, flattered, but puzzled. What we did was offer short courses... it was not a continuous form of education by any means.""    Newsnight has shown these details to some of Iain Duncan Smith's constituents in Chingford.    Several people assumed he must have been at both the University of Perugia and Dunchurch for several years, and obtained qualifications in either or both places.

72,"More than 200,000 people in rural Peru were pressured into being sterilised by the government of former President Alberto Fujimori, an official report has revealed.  The Health Minister, Fernando Carbone, said the government gave misleading information, offered food incentives and threatened to fine men and women if they had more children.  Poor indigenous people in rural areas were the main targets of the compulsive family planning programme until 2000, when Mr Fujimori left for Japan amid mounting corruption allegations against him.  Mr Carbone said there was evidence that Mr Fujimori and a number of high-ranking ministers could be held responsible for ""incorrect procedures"" and ""human rights violations"".  He called for a deeper investigation and promised that action would be taken against those found responsible for the forced sterilisations.  Figures show that between 1996 and 2000, surgeons carried out 215,227 sterilising operations on women and 16,547 male vasectomies.  This compared to 80,385 sterilisations and 2,795 vasectomies over the previous three years.  The result has been a demographical drop in certain areas, leaving an older population and the economic disadvantages which will result from fewer people able to earn a living.  The report, by the commission investigating ""voluntary contraceptive surgery"" activities, concluded that there had been numerous programmes during the Fujimori regime which threatened poor women in Peru.  The operations were promoted in a ""deceitful"" publicity campaign of leaflets, posters and radio advertisements promising ""happiness and well-being,"" the report said.  Investigations found that there was inadequate evaluation before surgery and little after-care.  The procedures were also found to have been negligent, with less than half being carried out with a proper anaesthetist.  The commission's report said the inadequate family planning policy had a psychological and moral impact and harmed the dignity and physical integrity of men as well as women.  Five hundred and seven people, from rural areas such as Cuzco and Ancash, gave testimonies to the commission.  Only 10% of these admitted having voluntarily agreed to the sterilisation procedure after promises of economic and health incentives such as food, operations and medicines.  Others said that if they refused they were told they would have to pay a fine and would not be able to seek medical help for their children.  The report added that most of the women interviewed said they were scared of talking because of threats made against anyone who spoke out.  The programme was found to have been designed, encouraged and monitored at the highest levels in Fujimori's government, including the president's office.  The number of operations, and pressure from government, started to fall after increasing concerns from human rights organisations within Peru and the international community."
73,"A plaque dedicated to writer Mile Budak and a statue honouring Jure Francetic were removed in accordance with laws banning any homage to fascism.  Budak, a minister in the 1941 to 1945 Ustasha government, introduced race laws which led to the execution of thousands of Jews, Serbs and Gypsies.  The monuments were erected recently and some locals objected to their removal.  Following the Nazi invasion in 1941, a ""Greater Croatia"" was formed, also comprising most of Bosnia and western Serbia.  The fascist puppet government under Ante Pavelic acted brutally against Serbs and Jews as it sought to create a Catholic, all-Croat republic.  Francetic was a top military officer, and founder of the infamous Black Legion unit, which served in Bosnia.  The plaque to Budak in Sveti Rok, Lovinac, was put up last week by a group which said it was funded by people who fled the country to Australia and Canada in 1945.  It drew criticism from the government as well as rights groups and the Roman Catholic Church.  The government, which hopes to start European Union membership talks next year, decided to order the removal of the monuments during an emergency session on Thursday.  The cabinet also said it wanted amendments to the penal code to ban the promotion of all totalitarian ideologies, including communism and fascism.  Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the government would ""not allow Croatia to be imprisoned by the past - particularly by negative notions - but will direct all its capacities toward the future"".  ""The monuments are contrary to fundamental elements of the Croatian constitution and damage the reputation and interests of Croatia,"" he added.  Reuters news agency said several villagers in Sveti Rok cried as workers took away the black marble plaque to Budak.  The statue to Francetic, erected a few years ago in Slunj, was also torn down under heavy police security on Friday."
74,"Former International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch has died in hospital after being taken ill at the weekend. The 89-year-old was admitted to the Quiron Hospital in Barcelona where he was being treated for heart problems. The Spaniard was widely regarded as the most powerful man in sport when he headed the IOC from 1980 to 2001. His successor, Jacques Rogge, said: ""I cannot find the words to express the distress of the Olympic family."" Rogge continued: ""I am personally deeply saddened by the death of the man who built up the Olympic Games of the modern era, a man who inspired me, and whose knowledge of sport was truly exceptional. He was quite simply the most intuitive leader I have ever met    ""Thanks to his extraordinary vision and talent, Samaranch was the architect of a strong and unified Olympic Movement. ""I can only pay tribute to his tremendous achievements and legacy, and praise his genuine devotion to the Olympic Movement and its values. ""We have lost a great man, a mentor and a friend who dedicated his long and fulfilled life to Olympism."" London 2012 chairman Lord Coe, who was close to Samaranch for three decades, said he had been an inspiration. ""I have lost a friend, one that moulded my path through sport from my early 20s, and the world has lost an inspirational man,"" said Coe. Probably the man who has made the Olympics such a spectacular and prestigious event that it is today. RIP Juan Antonio    ""A man that challenged us all to fight for sport, its primacy and its autonomy, a fight he led fearlessly from the front, creating an extraordinary sporting movement that reaches millions of people around the world. ""He was quite simply the most intuitive leader I have ever met."" Samaranch, who was admitted to hospital on Sunday with acute heart problems, died from cardio-respiratory failure. He had been plagued by ill-health in recent years, but continued to travel to IOC meetings around the world, and in February attended the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, walking with the help of a female assistant. Samaranch retired as IOC president in 2001, after 21 years at the helm. Only Pierre de Coubertin, the ""father"" of the modern Olympics - and IOC chief from 1896 to 1925 - had held the post for a longer period. Lamine Diack, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said Samaranach had used ""the skills of a natural diplomat"" to create a unified Olympic movement and make it the ""world's most influential sporting event"". ""But as well as his unique devotion to the Olympic movement and its values, I will never forget the deep respect and passion that Juan Antonio showed for the sport of athletics,"" he said. Dick Pound, a long-standing Canadian IOC member and the first president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, saluted Samaranch for creating an Olympics renaissance. ""He did essentially a two century jump. He got us from being in the remnants of the 19th century and got us into the 21st century,"" he said. ""He gave the organization financial stability, international presence and a certain gravitas it never had before."" Born in Barcelona on 17 July, 1920, Samaranch enjoyed success as a roller-skater and led the Spanish team to the world title. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. He pursued a career in sports politics in fascist dictator Francisco Franco's Spain and won a place on the IOC in 1966. After Franco's death, Samaranch was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union and the contacts he made there helped him succeed Lord Killanin as IOC president in 1980. He oversaw the commercialisation of the Olympics during the 1980s and 1990s and established the Games as a world force. BBC Radio 5 live Olympics correspondent Gordon Farquhar said of Samaranch: ""He took over during one of the movement's most difficult times, just before the Moscow games in 1980, which were affected by a US-led boycott in protest at Soviet foreign policy. ""The previous Olympics in Montreal had been a financial disaster, and the games were viewed as a burden, not an opportunity for the host nation. Only Los Angeles bid to stage the 1984 games. ""During his tenure, Samaranch helped revitalise the economic fortunes of the IOC through global sponsorship deals and marketing of TV rights. Professional athletes were fully embraced, finally ending the tradition of amateurism at the games."" During his tenure, Samaranch helped revitalise the economic fortunes of the IOC    Samaranch was criticised in some quarters for not taking the issue of doping seriously enough and for allowing bidding cities to ""over-indulge"" members. After 10 IOC members resigned or were expelled following a bribery scandal surrounding the Salt Lake winter Games, he introduced a series of reforms to clean up the organisation, including a ban on member visits to bid cities. Former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Craig Reedie defended Samaranch over the Salt Lake City scandal, saying: ""The good certainly outweighed the bad, if there was any bad at all. ""It was Samaranch who set up the commission to investigate the allegations, it was he who set up the reform commission and it was he who set up the ethics commission. ""Yes he must have been embarrassed by it but he then did something about it."" Simon Clegg, former chief executive of the BOA, said: ""He was a masterful politician and his contribution to the development of world sport cannot be underestimated."" Samaranch was made Honorary Life President after standing down in 2001, and in recent years was a key part of Madrid's failed bids to host the Olympics in 2012 and 2016, which were awarded to London and Rio de Janeiro respectively. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said: ""One of Spain's most emblematic figures has left us, a decisive figure in the resurgence of Spanish sport and in the Olympic movement inside our country. ""He was fundamental in Spain being awarded the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, and those Games were a tremendous success which in great part we owe to him."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said: ""Juan Antonio Samaranch was a very great figure of the Olympic movement. He is the man who furthered the increase in power of the Olympic movement by opening it to all sports and all countries.""     "

Mungall, 42, played 624 times for Tranmere from 1979 to 1996 and is currently head of the club's centre of excellence.  But he has now decided to leave football altogether and link up with a friend who is opening a branch of his Glasgow-based steel business in the Manchester area.  ""I've been with the club for 21 years and Tranmere will always be a place I have fond memories of and it will be strange when I finally leave,"" Mungall told the official Tranmere Rovers website.  ""People ask me about my best moments during my time here and I'd have to say the win over Exeter in 1987 is up there with the best of them. We had to win to stay in the league and to win that game was extremely rewarding.  ""After that, the club never really looked back as it went on its roller-coaster ride. My Wembley appearances, promotions and helping the club establish itself in the First Division are all moments I'll look back on fondly.""  Tranmere chairman Lorraine Rogers said: ""Our commitment to youth development remains as strong as ever and we will be looking to appoint a succesor as soon as possible.

76,"Cardiff is set for a big adventure in 2016 to celebrate the centenary of one of its most famous sons, Roald Dahl.  Loved for children's books such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Dahl was born in Llandaff and spent his early schooldays there.  Arts organisations have come together for a series of events, including a Cardiff-wide City of the Unexpected, which will mark his legacy.  Roald Dahl 100 aims to build on the Dylan Thomas centenary success in 2014.  The Welsh government, National Theatre Wales, Wales Millennium Centre and Literature Wales have unveiled details of a programme of events.  The launch was at the Norwegian Church in Cardiff Bay, where Dahl was baptised.  Deputy Minister for Culture Ken Skates said: ""The Roald Dahl 100 celebrations in 2016 should be quite an adventure - in the words of Willy Wonka, 'Tremendous things are in store for you! Many wonderful surprises await you!'""  Dahl's grandson, Luke Kelly said: ""It is wonderful to hear today all the exciting plans both in Cardiff and throughout Wales for 2016. My grandfather would have been moved and delighted by the range of activity as am I.""  He and Dahl's widow Felicity were unveiling an official Roald Dahl 100 logo on a flag, which will fly from the Norwegian Church Arts Centre in 2016.  City of the Unexpected will be bring a mix of theatre, art and performance spectacles across Cardiff.  John McGrath, of NTW, which is joining forces to co-produce events with the WMC, said: ""Expect to see everyday places utterly transformed - seen through the eyes of Roald Dahl - and get ready to meet some of your favourite characters in the most unexpected ways"".  Literature Wales will bring a programme across Wales, which it says will be aimed at children and adults alike.  Chief executive Lleucu Siencyn said: ""Roald Dahl is loved by children and adults all over the world but not many know that he was born in Cardiff and is one of ours. In 2016 we plan to bring Dahl back to Wales.""  With his stories available in 59 languages and with more than 200 million book sales worldwide, the centenary celebrations will be on a global scale.  Highlights include Steven Spielberg's adaption of Roald Dahl's The BFG, to be released in cinemas next July."
77,"He wants copyright to last 95 years, rather than the present 50 years.  But an independent review is to recommend the terms are not extended, a well-placed government source has said.  This outcome would mean the report had ""missed a great opportunity"" to support the music industry, the chairman of the British Phonographic Industry claimed.  ""There can be no rationale for discriminating against performing artists - a vital part of the creative mix,"" said Peter Jamieson.  ""Nor can it be possible to justify disadvantaging Britain and Europe in the global music market.  ""The sound recording is as important a copyright as musical composition and film, and deserves a similar lifespan.""  If the findings of the report, commissioned by the Treasury, were backed by the government, Sir Cliff's earliest tracks would start to come out of copyright in 2008.  His first big hit was Move It, recorded in 1958, when he was hailed as the British Elvis.  The Beatles would also be in a similar situation from 2012, the 50th anniversary of their first hit single, Love Me Do.  Music journalist Neil McCormack told BBC Radio Five Live that this outcome would be a blow to the industry.  ""This was set before the advent, the big boom, of rock 'n' roll - the boom in popular culture which has led to a whole vast number of people making their living from these royalties.  John Kennedy, the chairman of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, predicted the Treasury would be forced to decide ""whether or not it wants to support one of its successful industries"".  ""If the UK government decides not to support copyright equalisation, then the music industry will have to continue its campaign in Europe,"" he said.  ""There, the signs are encouraging, but there is no doubt that there will be raised eyebrows.""  People would ask why Europe should help the music industry when the government of the ""most important music market in Europe"" had decided not to, Mr Kennedy added.  The situation applies only to recording artists as composers and their families retain copyright on musical scores until 70 years after the author's death.  The copyright review was conducted for Chancellor Gordon Brown by Andrew Gowers, a former editor of the Financial Times.  His conclusions will be published next week, as part of the chancellor's annual pre-budget report, the BBC's business editor Robert Peston says."
78,"Singer Sir Cliff Richard is suing the BBC and South Yorkshire Police after being investigated over allegations of historical sexual assault.  Legal papers were filed at the High Court in London on Thursday.  They list Sir Cliff as a claimant, and the BBC and chief constable of South Yorkshire Police as defendants.  The star, 75, has always denied the allegations, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in June it was taking no further action against him.  The decision to sue the BBC and South Yorkshire Police comes after Sir Cliff was the subject of a long-running police investigation based on allegations dating between 1958 and 1983 made by four men.  Sir Cliff was named as the subject of the investigation after police officers searching his apartment in 2014 were filmed by the BBC.  The CPS announced it was taking no further action against Sir Cliff on 16 June on the grounds of insufficient evidence.  That decision was reviewed last month following an application by one of his alleged accusers, but concluded the original decision not to proceed was correct.  After that announcement, Sir Cliff told BBC Radio 2 that ""a cloud lifted"" when he was informed of the news he would not be prosecuted.  The singer has previously spoken publicly about the investigation and the publicity surrounding it.  In a statement released in June he criticised what he called ""vile accusations"", adding he was ""named before I was even interviewed, and for me that was like being hung out like 'live bait'"".  A spokesman for the singer said: ""We can confirm that Sir Cliff today issued legal proceedings at the High Court against both South Yorkshire Police and the BBC. It would not be appropriate to comment further.""  A BBC spokesman said: ""While we haven't received any notification of action, we've said previously we are very sorry that Sir Cliff has suffered distress but we have a duty to report on matters of public interest and we stand by our journalism."""
79,"Marks and Spencer has reported a big fall in profits, despite rising sales across the group.  Pre-tax profits fell to £564.3m, down from £658m last year, despite group sales rising 1.3% to £10bn for the year to 30 March.  While underlying sales of food rose 1.7%, sales of general merchandise - which includes clothing - fell 4.1% in the year.  Chief executive Marc Bolland described the market as ""challenging"".  M&S's clothing division, which has an 11% market share in the UK, has been struggling in recent years as sales have fallen.  In April, director of lingerie and beauty Janie Schaffer, who joined M&S from lingerie chain Victoria's Secret, left after just three months in the job.  In an effort to address its problems, M&S last year changed its retail team, bringing in Belinda Earl, a former chief executive of both Debenhams and Jaeger, as head of style. Last week it launched a new autumn/winter clothing collection, which it hopes will win back disaffected customers.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Bolland said: ""We won't duck the fact that we feel we have underperformed in general merchandise.  ""We have to improve on quality"", he added.  Mr Bolland also defended the company's tax affairs in the wake of controversy over tax avoidance schemes.  There was ""nothing fiscal"" in the company's use of Ireland as a trading hub for its international e-commerce business, he said, as the country now handles more than 50% of online trade.  ""M&S pays UK corporation tax on all the profits generated by UK sales"", he said. ""We contributed £800m to the UK tax authorities in 2011-12 - the 25th highest tax contributor in the UK.""  He maintained that M&S paid more corporation tax than many other FTSE 100 companies of bigger size.  The company also said it had appointed Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne - currently M&S's corporate director of strategy implementation and business development - as its new marketing director. He will succeed Steven Sharp in July.  M&S said Mr Sharp had ""played a significant role in shaping the M&S brand from the introduction of the 'Your M&S' branding in 2004 to numerous iconic advertising campaigns reinforcing M&S's quality, style and ethical credentials"".  M&S said that its international sales had risen by 4.5% over the past year.  Multi-channel sales, which include internet shopping, rose by 16.6% and now account for 13% of general merchandise sales.  About 3.6 million people visit the website each week, the company said, while in-store pick-up of online orders was proving increasingly popular.  Retail analysts Conlumino said that although international and online sales were growing, M&S needed to ""focus firmly"" on its UK business.  ""On this 'home front' advancement is a little less encouraging and, in clothing at least, has seemed more like a gentle evolution than a radical reinvention,"" Conlumino said.  ""We still believe M&S is nowhere near ambitious enough on the general merchandise front; in our view the company is too risk averse and is unwilling to break the mould of its traditional ways of doing business."""
80,"Nepal has elected its fourth prime minister in four years, with the Maoist party's Baburam Bhattarai beating rival Ram Chandra Poudel in an MPs' vote.  Mr Bhattarai got 340 votes to the Nepali Congress party candidate's 235, thanks to the support of smaller parties based in the country's south.  He vowed to complete the peace process after 10 years of civil war and reach agreement on a new constitution.  His predecessor, Jhalanath Khanal, was in post less than seven months.  Mr Khanal, who represented the Unified Marxist Leninist party, resigned earlier this month, unable to forge a consensus.  One of the key sticking points in the peace plan has been the proposed integration of 19,000 former Maoist rebel fighters into the army, with military leaders and the Nepali Congress resisting the move.  The rebels, represented by Mr Bhattarai's party, fought a decade-long guerrilla campaign against the former monarchy until joining the United Nations-supervised peace process in 2006.  The monarchy was eventually removed from power in 2008 but more than 16,000 people had died in the civil war.  Confusions surrounding the new government are over but challenges remain, says the BBC's Surendra Phuyal, in Kathmandu.  In order to get the peace and constitution-making processes on track, Mr Bhattarai will need support from the opposition parties and his party hard-liners, our correspondent says. Otherwise, the peace process could drag on and on.  Mr Bhattarai, 57, faces the immediate challenge of agreeing the first draft of the new constitution before August 31, the expiry date of the constituent assembly.  There has been political deadlock on the issue since the parliament's election, with the Maoists as the largest party, in 2008.  ""The country's future is very bright and we can accomplish the task of constitution-drafting and complete the peace process,"" the agency quoted him as saying."

Tim: Yes, I think none of that's true except the bit about my perspiring a lot. I do do that, I have to say. Yes, I'll accept that. I'm very pleased with that. Move on..    Barry, Humph describes you thus: ""The gag man. There are no embarrassing silences thanks to you...    Barry: Embarrassing noises but not silences.  Inteviewer: ...bottomless pit of one-liners, able to come up with gags at a second's notice, provides the bricks and mortar.""  Barry: And they let me appear in it sometimes as well. I bring my wheelbarrow. It's very gracious of him though, particularly about my quick wit.  Tim: Anyway, what would he know?    Graeme, you're described thus: ""Bides his time, picks his moment, a punchline man supreme, very dry, often has the perfect punchline which helps me (Humph) end the show on a high note.    Tim: Very dry as opposed to the very sweaty me, is that what he's saying?   Barry: Was that Humph who said that?  Interviewer: Yes.  Barry: I detect a very Graeme style in that.  Graeme: I put a stop to the fun basically is what he's saying.  Tim: Yes, but you bide your time about it.    Humph's very modest about his own comic abilities. What do you think his particular gifts are?    Barry: He's very arrogant, overbearing and quite ruthless.  Tim: I've been a fan of his since I was a teenager. I used to go listen to his band which still plays magnificently today. And I still get a thrill out of working with Humph. It's extraordinary, after all these years. He's such an incredibly nice and bright man and he is modest, but he shouldn't be. I think he's quite fantastic.  Barry: I still think 'It's him, it's him!'.    How much of his stuff is written and how much is ad-libbed?    Tim: Well, he is capable of writing everything but Iain Pattinson actually writes his script now. I think Iain would say that the great thing is you're writing for a great man. There's nothing worse for a writer than to write something that is delivered badly. Iain writes some good stuff and Humph makes it even better which is perfect for a writer.  Graeme: And, obviously, the nature of the show is not all scripted. Humph reads his links then we play the games and Humph says injections of his own and very often they're show-stoppers as well. He's an extremely funny man. I don't think he knows how funny he is or how he is funny which is probably a good thing - he just does it.  Barry: He's in a great tradition like Kenneth Horne was in Round the Horne - the obeying man in the middle with all the idiots milling about and he's never quite sure what's going on but he just wants to get it over.  Tim: And the seeming innocence allows him to be absolutely filthy. ""Humph can't have said that, can he?"" And, of course, everything he says is double entendre anyway and he looks really, genuinely surprised if the audience laughs. As Graeme says, he can ad-lib as well. I remember something he said during our recording on Sunday. He said something like ""Your hand writing is so bad, I have to pin it up and run past it to read it."" I don't quite know what it means but it made me laugh enormously.         Back to Interviews...     "
82,"Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze  Specialist fire crews based at either end of the Channel Tunnel are primed to deal with incidents such as Thursday evening's freight train blaze. Now that the fire is out, their attentions will be focused on finding out how the fire started. The French authorities have taken on responsibility for determining the cause of the fire, which brought chaos to thousands of travellers planning to use the Channel Tunnel. While a terrorist attack was an early fear, officials appear to have quickly ruled out this out. Initial findings suggest the blaze started accidentally on one of the lorries aboard the train. Prosecutor Gerald Lesigne, who is heading the investigation, said: ""We are looking at facts which point to an accident... at this stage no indication on the origin of the start of the fire is possible."" Jacques Gounon, chief executive of Eurotunnel, which operates the tunnel, said he also had no reason to believe the cause of the fire to have been ""criminal"". But he rejected early reports suggested the blaze may have been caused when a lorry's brake system overheated, causing a tyre to explode. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CHANNEL TUNNEL - 11 SEPTEMBER 2008 Fire started on lorry (1) just before 1500 BST on train from Folkestone to Calais. Lorry drivers heard series of explosions. They broke windows (2) to get out of amenity car. Altogether 32 people, including seven Britons, were evacuated into service tunnel (3).    Investigators are likely to examine the presence of a lorry carrying highly flammable carbolic acid, or phenol, which is reported to have overturned before the fire. Whatever the cause, the incident will bring the tunnel's safety standards under scrutiny. Mr Gounon said Eurotunnel was ""well-equipped"" to deal with any operational incident and had ""demonstrated its abilities to respond effectively"". But the fire has prompted Conservative MEP and transport spokesman Timothy Kirkhope to demand a full inquiry by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority into chemicals in the tunnel. ""Many people will be asking why such chemicals are granted authorisation when even LPG passenger cars are banned for safety reasons,"" he said. After a 1996 fire in the tunnel, which caused £200m of damage, firefighters' unions were highly critical of the design of freight train wagons. While cars using the tunnel are parked in containers, lorries on freight services are not enclosed. Channel Tunnel operators had originally looked into providing fire-resistant sealed wagons to carry HGVs. However, according to the Rail Accident Investigation Board, they would have been too heavy and so the requirement for them to be fire-resistant was scrapped. Fire is picked up by the tunnel's smoke detectors, positioned roughly every 1,500m The tunnel's fire detection controller orders the driver to stop and imposes speed limits on all trains The driver shuts the train's ventilation dampers to stop smoke affecting passengers Those on board are evacuated through the ""cross passages"" to the service tunnel, where smaller vehicles take them to safety Managers alert fire crews from the English and French tunnel entrances All other trains clear the tunnel The Bi-National Emergency Plan is put into action and emergency services take control of the tunnel As a result, freight wagons were built with a roof and fireproof floor but with ""perforated"" sides and open ends which allow air to fuel any fire that breaks out as the train moves. Fires in enclosed spaces such as tunnels are difficult to tackle for firefighters, who arrive on the scene to be confronted by thick black smoke. Sean Bone-Knell, assistant director of operations with Kent Fire and Rescue, said crews faced intense humidity and temperatures of up to 1,000C (1,832F) for stretches of almost six hours at a time during the latest incident. ""It was a very, very strenuous incident for the firefighters to deal with, a very different incident to what they are used to,"" he said. ""It would have been very arduous for them with very hot, humid conditions because the heat and fumes have nowhere to go."" Kent crews work in tandem with French counterparts, using a prepared Bi-National Emergency Plan (BINAT) to deal with incidents. The Channel Tunnel is made up of three separate 50km (31-mile) passages -two main rail routes, with a service tunnel running between them. This smaller tunnel, connected to the others by cross passages at 375m (1,230ft) intervals, plays a key role in the firefighters' emergency response. It is their access route to incident scenes and contains a 25.4cm (10 inch) water main and high-pressure pumps. Higher air pressure is also maintained in the service tunnel to stop smoke getting into it and ensure clean air continues to pass through. A report by the US-based National Fire Protection Association into the 1996 fire described how this aided the firefighters. It said the air pressure, flowing through a cross passage and into the rail tunnel, created a metre-wide ""bubble"" where firefighters could safely stand. ""Passing beyond this boundary meant facing intense heat and smoke, which required full protective gear,"" said the report. ""Even so, the crews came back after 8 to 10 minutes 'looking like lobsters'. ""Firefighters also had to dodge pieces of concrete falling from the tunnel ceilings and walls. ""The debris also collected on the tunnel walkways, creating a sloping surface that was difficult to walk on. ""It, too, was intensely hot, according to firefighters whose soles were burned from standing on them."" Even though the main source of the fire has been dealt with, the firefighters still have a tough job. Kent's Chief Fire Officer Bill Feeley said conditions would remain difficult even hours after the initial call. ""Imagine one burning tyre and the smoke that emits. When you put that into a very confined space, that's still a lot of smoke,"" he said. ""We've got to work and make sure that we actually put the fire out and it's completely extinguished. ""There's still a big job of work to make sure the investigation is done properly. ""That means preserving the scene of the fire, to make sure we've got all the evidence and it's properly available to us.""     "
83,"Saudi Arabia has said it is recalling its ambassador from Damascus in protest against Syria's deadly crackdown on anti-government demonstrators.  A statement from King Abdullah said the violence was ""unacceptable"" and called for it to stop before it was too late.  It came hours after the Arab League issued its first official statement, strongly condemning the violence.  On Sunday, more than 80 people died as the army launched assaults in eastern and central Syria, activists said.  They said at least 50 died when soldiers, backed by scores of tanks and armoured vehicles, stormed Deir al-Zour during the dawn call to prayer.  A man living in the city told the BBC the tanks had been withdrawn from the eastern city, but that residents feared they would come back.  Twenty-six others were killed in Hula, near the city of Homs, including a 10-year-old boy. Deaths were also reported in Idlib in the north-west.  The Local Co-ordination Committees, an activist group that documents and organises protests, said that after sunset, thousands of protesters poured onto the streets in towns and cities, including Damascus and its suburbs, Homs, Aleppo, and Latakia on the Mediterranean coast.  Activists say at least 1,700 civilians have been killed and tens of thousands arrested since the uprising began in mid-March.  By Arab diplomatic standards, it was a highly dramatic intervention by the Saudi monarch. A statement from him was read out on al-Arabiya, saying the kingdom had taken an historic decision despite all the support it had given Syria in the past. It is by far the clearest and toughest regional position Syria has met, and it comes from one of the most influential Arab powers. Another major force in the region, Turkey, is stepping up the pressure too. Its foreign minister is due in Damascus on Tuesday with a tough message for President Assad. The US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has asked the Turkish minister to press the regime to pull its troops back to barracks. But so far, there is no sign of that happening. Damascus has said its critics are ignoring the killings and destruction by what it calls ""armed terrorist gangs"", and also ignoring the reform programme that the regime has launched in a bid to defuse the crisis. It says it needs more time. But time seems to be running out, as the country slips daily closer to the spectre of a sectarian civil war that has set the regional alarm bells ringing.  Access to Syria has been severely restricted for international journalists and it is rarely possible to verify accounts by witnesses and activists.  In a major escalation in international pressure on President Bashar al-Assad, King Abdullah declared on Sunday evening that his country had taken an ""historic decision"" despite all the support it had given Syria in the past.  ""Any sane Arab, Muslim or anyone else knows that this has nothing to do with religion, or ethics or morals; spilling the blood of the innocent for any reasons or pretext leads to no path to... hope,"" he said in a statement broadcast by the Saudi-owned satellite channel, al-Arabiya.  ""What is happening in Syria is not acceptable for Saudi Arabia,"" he added. ""There are only two options for Syria's future: either it chooses wisdom on its own, or it will be pulled down into the depths of chaos and loss.""  ""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia... demands an end to the killing-machine and bloodshed and calls for acts of wisdom before it is too late.""  ""Syria should think wisely before it is too late and issue and enact reforms that are not merely promises but actual reforms,"" he concluded.  BBC Middle East correspondent Jon Leyne says the statement seems to be a co-ordinated move, following the Arab League's own communique.  The 22-member league said it was ""alarmed"" by the situation in the country and called for an immediate end to the violence.  The six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) also issued its first comments about the unrest on Saturday, condemning the ""excessive use of force"" and calling for an ""immediate end to the violence"".  King Abdullah sent Saudi troops in March to Bahrain as part of a GCC force to help the country's Sunni monarchy crush anti-government protests led by the Shia majority. Saudi officials also criticised the decision to put Egypt's ousted president, Hosni Mubarak, on trial.  Our correspondent says President Assad is now even more isolated.  A US state department official said the Saudi monarch's statement was ""another clear sign that the international community, including Syria's neighbours, are repulsed by the brutal actions of the Syrian government"".  Diplomatic tension with neighbouring Turkey is also rising.  Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that Ankara had ""run out of patience"" with President Assad's regime and that it could no longer ""remain a spectator"" to events across its border.  He announced that he was sending Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu to Damascus on Tuesday to deliver a ""tough message"".  But one of Mr Assad's top advisers said he would be given an even tougher message to take home.  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke to President Assad by telephone on Saturday, urging him to stop the use of military force against protesters and to allow humanitarian missions into his country.  Last week the UN Security Council also called on the Syrian leader to stop the violence.  President Assad has insisted that his government is enacting reforms. He blames the violence on ""armed terrorist gangs"" which he says are backed by foreign powers.  ""Syria is on the path to reform,"" he was quoted as telling Lebanese Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour by the state news agency, Sana.  ""To deal with outlaws who cut off roads, seal towns and terrorise residents is a duty of the state, which must defend security and protect the lives of civilians,"" he added."

However, no action will be taken against Fifa president Sepp Blatter."
85,"Alija Izetbegovic will be best remembered as the president of Bosnia during the bloody war which wracked the Balkans during the early 1990s.  For much of the time, he and his government were trapped in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, surrounded by Serbian forces positioned on the hills which overlook the city.  But he, and his country, survived. The 1995 peace agreement allowed Bosnia to begin reconstruction and make tentative moves towards reconciliation.  Born in 1925 in Bosanki Samac, a town in northern Bosnia, Izetbegovic's Muslim family moved to Sarajevo in his childhood. Much of his adolescence was spent under Nazi occupation.  After World War II, he graduated in law from Sarajevo University and earned a reputation as a fervent anti-communist.  In the late 1940s he was jailed for three years by Tito's communist authorities for membership of a nationalist group, the Young Muslims, which campaigned against the religious constraints imposed by the government.  He wrote an ""Islamic declaration"" in 1970 which the former communist authorities in Yugoslavia interpreted as a call for the introduction of fundamentalist Sharia law in Bosnia-Hercegovina - then one of the Yugoslav republics.  Izetbegovic was jailed once more - this time for nine years - in 1983 by Tito's successors, who accused him of plotting a coup and disseminating ""Islamic propaganda"", but released in 1988.  Serbs would later accuse Izetbegovic of wanting to create an Iran-style Muslim republic in Bosnia, a charge which he always denied.  Two years later he became Bosnian president.  As Yugoslavia began disintegrating, Mr Izetbegovic worked desperately to preserve the country. But Croats and Serbs were sharpening their knives, preparing to carve up Bosnia.  Mr Izetbegovic went for independence, which was backed in a referendum, in turn igniting a war which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.  The Serbs are blamed for the lion's share of the killing, but they argue the Bosnians, under Mr Izetbegovic's supreme command, were guilty of atrocities and have been pressing the war crimes tribunal in The Hague to indict him.  Mr Izetbegovic became an international figure during the conflict, when his capital Sarajevo was besieged for years by Bosnian Serb forces.  He led his Muslim-dominated government from sandbagged buildings in the city centre, symbolising the government's defiance in the war.  Many Bosnian Muslims call him ""dedo"" (grandpa) for his ""father of the nation"" role.  In 1995, he was among the signatories of the Dayton Peace Agreement which ended the war and split Bosnia between Serb and the Bosnian Muslim/Croatian confederation.  He became the Muslim member of the joint presidency until his retirement."
86,"Original cast members of the TV and radio versions of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are reuniting for a new stage production.  The show will star Simon Jones, who played lead character Arthur Dent in the TV and radio versions of Douglas Adams's sci-fi comedy.  It will be staged as a radio recording, which will be made available for download after the tour.  The show's first performance will be at Glasgow's Theatre Royal on 8 June.  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Show - Live! will play at a host of other venues throughout June and July, ending at the Edinburgh Playhouse on 21 July.  The production has been adapted and written by its director Dirk Maggs, who was behind Hitchhiker's 2003 revival on radio.  Susan Sheridan, who played Trillian in the original 1978 radio adaptation, will also appear in the show, alongside Geoffrey McGivern who will reprise his role as Ford Prefect.  A number of guest stars are due to provide the voice for the guidebook which steers Dent around the universe.  Their names will be announced closer to its opening date, the show's producers said.  Adams's creation began life on radio in 1978, with the initial novel of a ""trilogy in five parts"" published one year later.  Adams died in 2001. A sixth novel, written by Eoin Colfer, was published in 2009.  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which was made into a BBC TV series in 1981, made a return to radio in 2003.  A year later, a big-screen version was made starring Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent and Stephen Fry as the voice of the guide.  A number of other stage productions have been created, the most recent being produced by Wales' Theatr Clywd in 1980."
87,"The King Harry Ferry at Feock takes cars and passengers on a 450yd (412m) trip across the River Fal.  It is the view of the river which has put the ferry crossing in the top 10, rivalling Lake Titicaca in Bolivia and the Grand Canal in Venice.  The report was compiled by independent travel writer Ryan Levitt.  Tim Light, the managing director of the ferry, says it was a complete surprise when he was told the news by Cornwall Enterprise.  He said: ""I think the ferry's popularity is down to a combination of the unique natural environment and wonderful history.""  The first steam ferry service across the Fal from Feock to Philleigh on the Roseland peninsula started in 1888.  The current ferry has been in service from 1974. It carried 300,000 cars and a million people last year.  It is thought the ferry may have been named after King Henry VIII, who spent part of his honeymoon with Anne Boleyn at nearby St Mawes Castle and signed a charter for a ferry service."
88,"                           In the aftermath of the disaster at Chernobyl, a team of soviet scientists risked their lives by going back into the reactor to investigate the scale of the damage. The investigation, dubbed Complex Expedition, was driven by the fear that there could be a second accident at Chernobyl if the missing nuclear fuel - plutonium, uranium and other extremely radioactive elements - was not located and contained. Radiation emissions were still dangerously high and the scientists were exposed to levels of radiation that would be considered almost suicidal in the West. At the time, they had been worried that the uncontrollable reactor might explode again, and had to assume that a self-sustaining chain reaction was possible. To prevent this, the Red Army initially bombed the reactor with neutron absorbers and other chemicals. The intense radiation killed several pilots. It is now known that, despite those sacrifices, almost no neutron absorbers reached the core. Inexplicably on May 6th, the emissions stopped. Something had happened in the core of the reactor. Engineers began work on the construction of a concrete sarcophagus to surround the failed reactor to stop rain getting in and triggering a second explosion. Forced to build straight on to the damaged, red hot hull of Chernobyl Unit Four, the Russian energy authorities faced the biggest civil engineering task in history. A quarter of a million construction workers on the Chernobyl sarcophagus reached official lifetime limits of radiation. When the problem seemed to be literally buried, scientists working inside the reactor continued their hunt for nuclear fuel. Collected manually, the cold rods of fuel that turned up could not account for the great heat still emanating from the core. The scientists monitored rates of radiation in the building by drilling into the heart of the sarcophagus and inserting long metal detector tubes into the reactor to measure rates of radioactive decay. As well as radiation, they were exposed to high levels of radioactive dust. Meanwhile, volunteers from the military were working on the exterior of the building, pushing nuclear fuel rods that had been spat out in the blast, back into the reactor ruins. The hunt for nuclear fuel went on for six months before there was any result. Lava, glass and crystal flow discovered in the base of the reactor In December 1986, an intensely radioactive mass was discovered in the basement of Unit Four and scientists rigged up a crude wheeled camera to investigate. The mass was more than two metres across and weighed hundreds of tons. Because of its odd wrinkled shape, it was christened, ""the elephant's foot"". To approach it meant certain death. Analysis of the material showed that it was composed of sand, glass and nuclear fuel, and the proportion of sand suggested to scientists that a large amount of fuel had escaped from the reactor in this form. Underneath the reactor, the investigation team found steaming hot concrete and, draining into the basement, lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms - Chernobylite. The findings meant that the risk of a second explosion had receded, but that serious problems remained. The explosion dislodged the 2000 ton lid of the reactor The walls of the sarcophagus are starting to fall down, having been built straight on top of the collapsed and unstable reactor walls. If the walls collapse, the resulting radioactive dust will escape. The explosion also threw the 2000 ton reactor lid into the air. It fell on its edge into the mouth of the core, and rests at a precarious angle half way down. Scientists who worked on the Complex Exploration say that there are likely to be major collapses in the next ten years without further construction work. Russian research into Chernobyl has now been cut back because of safety problems, and the high death rate - caused by radiation and the stress related conditions - of the scientists involved An alliance of European companies has draw up plans to cover the reactor with a concrete structure designed to last longer than the pyramids, and big enough to allow the work of locating and packaging up radioactive material to continue. So far, the money needed to recover the site has not been found but the contents of the Chernobyl tomb will remain radioactive for at least the next 100,000 years.                             The BBC is not responsible for the content of these internet sites.

89,"The Reds beat AC Milan in last season's final but, because they finished out of the Premiership's top four, were not guaranteed entry in 2005-2006.  Uefa's executive committee changed its rules on Friday to allow Liverpool in.  ""We wish to express our thanks to those who supported us and campaigned,"" said chief executive Rick Parry.  Rafael Benitez's men will now face a first qualifying round first leg on 12 or 13 July and a second leg on 19 or 20 July.  That means they will now probably have to cancel scheduled friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Cologne.  And if successful in the first qualifying round, they will probably also have to cancel a pre-season tour of Japan, where they are due to play Shimizu S-Pulse and Kashima Antlers.  Uefa chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson told BBC Radio Five Live the decision by the 14-man executive committee was unanimous.  ""Unanimous means that everybody is supporting it. By definition, that is also the case here.  ""There were no discussions actually on where they should enter the competition because everybody was of the opinion they should be given the opportunity but they have to start from the beginning.  ""They could not be allowed to get into the 32 for example.""  But while there is joy for Liverpool, there has been disappointment for Manchester City.  The Uefa Cup spot which Liverpool had earned for finishing fifth in the Premiership will not transfer to another English club so City, who would have been next in line, will not be in Europe.  And it is likely that Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton will be unhappy at potentially sharing the television money with one other club.  Uefa spokesman William Gaillard admitted splitting the pot five ways rather than four will be ""a burden on the other English-based clubs"".  If Manchester United or Everton fail to reach the group stage but Liverpool do the pot could go back to being split four ways - but anyone involved from England will still get less because of the Reds.  If four English clubs reach the group stages, Chelsea will get 40%, Arsenal 30% and two out of Manchester United, Liverpool and Everton will get 15% each.  If all five get through Uefa will think again.  But while the others will feel hard done by, even Liverpool have suffered in comparison with other Champions League winners.  Normally the title holders get 30% of the money for their country if they are not also the domestic champions.  Meanwhile Uefa insists the saga which has dogged it since Liverpool finished fifth domestically and then won the Champions League will never be repeated.  ""The Uefa executive committee decided to amend the regulations for the future editions of the Champions League, so that the holders will have the right to defend their title and therefore qualify automatically,"" said a statement on the organisation's website.  The new system is in marked contrast to 2000, when Real Madrid won the Champions League but finished outside of Spain's qualification positions.  On that occasion fourth-placed Real Zaragoza were relegated to the Uefa Cup.  Reacting to the news, Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann told BBC Radio Five Live: ""It's tremendous news, great for the club.  ""We've still got two or three weeks to prepare, which should be enough to get in physical shape to cope with the pre-season schedule.""  And Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick added: ""We thank the Uefa executive committee and especially its president Lennart Johansson for listening to the strength of the argument for Liverpool's entry.  ""We always said that this was an exceptional situation which required an exceptional solution. For the very first time, one country has five teams in the Champions League and we have to be delighted at that.  ""We believed there were very strong sporting reasons for Liverpool to defend their title, not least after that fantastic final in Istanbul. That view has prevailed, and rightly so.""  Sports minister Richard Caborn added: ""I'm delighted that Uefa have decided to allow Liverpool to defend their trophy.  ""This is a triumph for common sense and the spirit of sport. I look forward to the start of the new season and the British clubs making a powerful impact again.""  But some Liverpool supporters are unhappy with the decision.  Les Lawson, spokesman for the Liverpool International Supporters' Club, said: ""Uefa has been caught with egg on their faces over this because the FA put the first four in the Premiership into next season's tournament.  ""It means Uefa has had to sort it out and they have done the minimum possible. They have treated their own champions with contempt.  ""It is a disgrace. Liverpool are the top team in Europe because they are the holders and have beaten Europe's best. They are being treated like TNS or other very small clubs.  ""To be told they have to start in the first qualifier is wrong and a real kick in the teeth.""  And Alan Kennedy, who scored the winning goal for the Reds in the 1981 final against Real Madrid, added: ""Coming in at the early stages disregards where Liverpool finished in the Champions League.  ""They won it, so they should be entitled to be in at the third qualifying round."""
90,"Date of birth: 2 July 1940   Job: Former chancellor, currently on the back benches    Education: Nottingham High School; Caius College, Cambridge   Family: Married, one son, one daughter  On his party's future: ""We must raise the level of public debate in Britain. We must seek to avoid excessive use of slogans and mere abuse. We must set out a vision for the public as to how Britain can be better governed not just in terms of policies but in terms of a proper trustworthy system of accountable governance.""  What the press say: ""He is bitterly opposed by Eurosceptics but still has the political clout and 'bloke appeal' with voters to attract support from Tories who put winning the next election above purity of policy,"" Colin Brown, The Independent.  Despite no longer sitting on the front bench, Kenneth Clarke remains one of the Conservative Party's most senior and important figures.  Famed for his love of cigars, jazz and classic cars, the clubbable former chancellor is seen as a true big hitter who is still well regarded in the country. When he stood for the party leadership in 2001, opinion polls suggested he was most popular Conservative politician with the British people.  Mr Clarke is one of the few remaining members of John Major's government still in the House of Commons. Another is his potential leadership rival Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who returned to the Commons at this year's general election.  Mr Clarke is one of the most ardent supporters of Europe and the euro among current MPs - a stance which may have scuppered his two previous leadership bids.  Since becoming an MP in 1970, Mr Clarke has risen steadily up the Conservative ladder.  When Margaret Thatcher led the party to victory in 1979 she appointed Mr Clarke to the post of junior transport minister.  Over the next 10 years, he served as a junior minister in the departments of health, employment and trade and industry.  It was not until 1988, that Mr Clarke was promoted to the cabinet.  As health secretary, he was given the job of driving through controversial and far-reaching reforms of the NHS, including the internal market.  When John Major became leader he moved Mr Clarke to education and later the Home Office.  After the events of Black Wednesday, the resignation of Norman Lamont and the decision to leave the ERM, Mr Clarke was made chancellor.  It was as chancellor in the Major years that much of Mr Clarke's reputation and standing rests.  His period in charge of the Treasury saw interest rates, inflation and unemployment all falling.  Despite the economy's health, Mr Major's Conservatives - riven by splits over whether the UK should join the European single currency - suffered a huge electoral defeat in 1997.  Once the defeated Tory leader threw in the towel, Mr Clarke was one of the first to enter the leadership race.  Coming from the left of the party, and being one of the most pro-euro Conservative MPs, he lost out in the end to the youthful and more Eurosceptic William Hague, who benefited from the backing of Lady Thatcher.  Mr Clarke headed to the backbenches, taking on some company directorships and the deputy chairmanship of British American Tobacco.  He threw his hat into the ring again in 2001 after William Hague resigned, making it to the final round.  But Mr Clarke's hopes evaporated when the poll was opened up to party members, a majority of whom opted for Iain Duncan Smith.  He returned again to the backbenches, deciding not to stand against Michael Howard in 2003.  Mr Clarke's opposition to the Iraq war kept his name in the headlines and he has never been far from leadership speculation - despite the fact that he will be almost 70-years-old by the next general election.  He has said he still wants to be prime minister, but has no interest in leading a Tory party that is not prepared to occupy the centre ground.  He has also been more critical of Europe in recent times, saying he does not think Britain could join the euro with ""complete security and confidence"" for 10 years.  Mr Clarke's pro-euro stance had been seen as an obstacle to him standing."
91,"Leaked documents relating to the Middle East peace process suggest Britain's intelligence service has been closely involved in attempts to weaken Hamas.  The documents, published by al-Jazeera, date back to 2004, before the militant group won elections in 2006 and took control of the Gaza Strip.  The Foreign Office says it has a long-standing policy not to comment on intelligence matters.  The BBC has been unable to independently verify the papers.  The Arabic news network al-Jazeera is gradually publishing 1,600 confidential documents from more than 10 years of secret US-brokered Middle East peace talks.  The seven-page Palestinian Security Plan, written by British intelligence officials, says its objective is to ""encourage and enable the Palestinian Authority (PA) to fully meet its security obligations under Phase 1 of the Roadmap"" - the US-backed 2003 peace initiative, under which Israel agreed to stop settlement building and Palestinians to clamp down on militant activity.  It proposes a number of ways of ""degrading the capabilities of rejectionists"", naming Hamas, PIJ (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) and the al-Aqsa Brigades.  This would involve ""the disruption of their leaderships' communications and command and control capabilities; the detention of key middle-ranking officers; and the confiscation of their arsenals and financial resources held within the Occupied Territories"".  The document goes on to suggest: ""We could also explore the temporary internment of leading Hamas and PIJ figures, making sure they are well-treated, with EU funding"".  The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says the news that MI6 have been involved in such plans is controversial.  While some will say MI6 was simply helping the PA to restore law and order in the Occupied Territories, there have been numerous allegations of abuse by the Palestinian security officials, so there will be suggestions that Britain has been in some way colluding with the PA in this, says our correspondent.  The Foreign Office said the UK ""absolutely condemns any abuse of human rights"", and has been involved in a programme to build the capacity of the Palestinian Security Forces for a number of years.  In a statement, it said the UK has previously provided funding for training in all aspects of government and currently provides budgetary support to the PA as well as a leadership programme ""which focuses on teaching the importance of human rights to middle and high ranking members of the security forces"".  Also released on Tuesday was a handwritten account of an alleged 2005 meeting between Israel's then defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, and the PA's interior minister, Nasser Youssef.  In it, the men discuss Hassan al-Madhoun, a member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades which is linked to Hamas' rival, Fatah.  Mr Mofaz asks: ""Why don't you kill him?"", to which Mr Youssef replies that he has given instructions to West Bank security chief Rasheed Abu Shabak"" and that ""we will see"".  Hassan al-Madhoun was killed in an Israeli air strike a few months later.  And in a document dated 17 April, 2009, Mr Erekat is reported as telling US official David Hale: ""We have had to kill Palestinians to establish one authority one gun and the rule of law.""  Others alleged revelations from the Palestinian Papers outline major concessions Palestinians offered during talks, which were rejected by Israel. They include:  Palestinian leaders say the disclosures have been taken out of context. They are now searching for the source of the leaks.  Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Erekat accused al-Jazeera of mounting ""the most severe smear campaign in the history of journalism"" and called on the station to ""publish the Palestinian official papers and positions on Jerusalem, borders, settlements, refugees and all other issue""."
92,"Police forces around the UK could benefit from a system that can detect accidental 999 calls from mobile phones.  The system, called Silent Solutions, has been used by the Metropolitan Police for almost a year to screen out such calls made in London.  More than two million silent calls have been successfully dealt with and £3 million saved thanks to the new system.  Nearly half of all emergency calls made from mobiles are accidental and it has caused a huge headache for police and other emergency services.  All silent calls, where the caller does not specify the emergency service they require, are automatically forwarded to local police forces.  Under the Silent Solutions system, all silent calls received by the 999 switchboard are automatically forwarded to an automated service.  The service plays a recorded message informing the caller that they have been connected to the police at New Scotland Yard.  The message informs the caller that if they require either the police, ambulance, fire brigade or another emergency service they must press the number five on their keypad twice.  If this action is taken the call will be reconnected as a priority to an operator but in the vast majority of cases there is no response and the line is disconnected.  All of the calls are recorded.  ""It's a very important facility to have especially at the Met which has to deal with an enormous number of calls and needs something sophisticated,"" said a spokesperson for ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers).  ""So many false calls are made without the user knowing,"" he added.  The growth of mobile phone use has had a dramatic impact on call handling.  In order to cope with the increase in calls, the Metropolitan Police is receiving £140m of government money to overhaul its 999 call centres, reports Computing magazine.  The aim of the project is to improve the processes behind the 999 service as the number of calls increases.  The central communications information room at New Scotland Yard receives an average of 8,500 emergency calls each day.  Silent Solutions has intercepted around 2,000 calls a day, freeing up valuable police resources to deal with real emergencies.  Since introducing the system, the number of calls answered within 15 seconds has risen from 53% to over 88%.  The majority of accidental emergency calls are made through the knocking of the mobile phone keypad when it is in a bag or pocket.  A European Union directive makes it mandatory for owners to still be able to dial an emergency service even when the keypad on a mobile phone is locked."
93,"There has been a rise in GP prescriptions for alcohol dependency Hospital admissions linked to alcohol use have more than doubled in England since 1995, an NHS report shows. Alcohol was the main or secondary cause of 207,800 NHS admissions in 2006/7, compared to 93,500 in 1995/96. There has also been a 20% rise in the number of GP prescriptions for treating alcohol dependency in the past four years, the NHS Information Centre said. The British Liver Trust warned that the health impact of alcohol would only get worse in years to come. Tim Straughan, chief executive of the NHS Information Centre, agreed that alcohol was placing an ever-increasing burden on the NHS. We are talking about a younger age group, drinking sometimes huge quantities, which can be damaging    ""These rises paint a worrying picture about the relationship between the population and the bottle,"" he added. The figures include hospital admissions for a specific alcohol-related condition - such as liver disease, but also admissions where alcohol is a contributory factor but not the main cause - such as falls due to drunkenness. Of hospital admissions in 2006/7 specifically due to an alcohol-related diagnosis, almost one in 10 were in under 18 year olds. In 2006 there were 6,500 deaths related to alcohol, of which two thirds were men - a 19% rise from 2001 figures. The north west had the highest rate of alcohol-related admissions at 170 per 100,000, while the lowest was the east of England which had 72 per 100,000. Survey results also contained in the report showed more pupils aged 11 to 15 years who say they have never had an alcoholic drink increased from 39% in 2001 to 45% in 2006. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. But those who admit to drinking are drinking more - consuming 11.4 units per week on average, the highest figure ever recorded by the survey. And 30% of 15 year olds said it was fine to get drunk at least once a week, the poll of over 8,000 teens found. Among adults in 2006, 72% of men and 57% of women reported drinking an alcoholic drink on at least one day in the previous week. And 12% of men and 7% of women reported drinking on every day in the previous week. Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader According to the NHS Information Centre alcohol was 69% more affordable in 2007 than in 1980. Dr Varuna Aluvihare, a liver specialist at Kings College Hospital said: ""We are talking about a younger age group, drinking sometimes huge quantities, which can be damaging. ""We are seeing people in their 20s and 30s. When I started practising, we saw people in their 50s."" Frank Soodeen, spokesperson for Alcohol Concern said the figures confirmed what they had heard from frontline NHS staff. ""The government needs to shape a response that meets the challenges thrown up by this bulletin. ""Information campaigns are a great first step, but we also need urgent investment in treatment systems that help steer problem drinkers away from harmful behaviour before they develop chronic conditions."" Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said the government was working harder than ever to reduce alcohol-related hospital admissions. ""The NHS spends £217m a year on specialist alcohol treatment and I have just launched a £6m campaign to make sure people know their units and know how much they're drinking."" Alison Rogers, chief executive of the British Liver Trusts said: ""This is set to hit England hard over the following years because liver disease can take up to 10 years to develop. ""We need action now to protect people's health to stop health harm from alcohol spiralling out of control.""     "
94,"Heathrow Airport has unveiled three options for a new runway, saying each one would be ""quicker and cheaper"" than plans for a rival hub airport.  The airport's submission to the Davies Commission, which is looking at raising airport capacity, outlined a runway to the north, north-west or south-west of the existing airport.  It said a new runway could be in place by 2029, allowing 260,000 more flights.  Heathrow submitted its options to the government-appointed Airports Commission, headed by former Financial Services Authority chairman Sir Howard Davies.  It is reviewing how the UK might expand its airport capacity in south-east England and interested parties have until Friday 19 July to submit their preferred options.  Ahead of submitting its proposals on Friday, Gatwick bosses said this week that they would prefer ""a constellation system of three London airports - keeping Heathrow open, whilst building an additional runway at Gatwick, and then perhaps in time a new runway at Stansted"".  On Monday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson published proposals for three possible replacement hubs - an artificial island in the Thames Estuary dubbed ""Boris Island"", a major expansion at Stansted, or an airport at the Isle of Grain in north Kent.  The commission is expected to recommend options by the end of this year, but will not submit its final report until summer 2015 - after the next general election.  According to Heathrow's submission, building a new runway would deliver extra capacity at the airport by 2025-29 and would allow it to operate 740,000 flights a year - up from the current limit of 480,000.  Heathrow's preferred option would be to place a new runway to the north-west or the south-west of the airport.  This would ""deliver a full-length third runway while minimising the impact on the local community"".  The submission also detailed how a new westerly runway would help reduce noise pollution because planes would not have to fly so low over London.  It predicted that, even with a third runway, there would be 10-20% fewer people affected by noise under its new plans.  Each of the options would mean the compulsory purchase of some properties and some property demolitions, as well as potentially major work on the M25.  Stanwell Moor is a village near Heathrow and one of its councillors said it would ""get completely destroyed"" under one of the options.  I've just been looking back through my notes from last year, when I talked to government officials about the prospect of building a third runway at Heathrow. They told me it was ""dead and buried"" and said they'd look at ""all ideas bar a third runway"". Back then we also had a Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, who lived under the flight path and had campaigned against the plan. What a difference to today, when a third runway at the UK's biggest and busiest airport is very much back on the table. This is a big week for airports. By Friday, we'll know all the different suggestions on how they could expand. But don't let all this apparent momentum fool you. This is one of the thorniest issues in politics, and there are plenty in the industry who think that 20 years from now, nothing will have actually been done.  ""I wasn't totally surprised because we knew these would be in the pipeline but it's a pretty desperate situation and pretty frightening,"" said Robert Evans.  ""The real problem now is the area is blighted and there will be a period of uncertainty; people will be anxious because they bought their homes and now they find the home isn't the asset they thought.""  Residents' group Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise (Hacan) said it would fight any proposal for a new runway ""tooth and nail"".  Hacan chairman John Stewart said it was difficult to square Heathrow's claim that expansion could take place while cutting noise for residents.  Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews said the UK ""desperately needed a single hub airport with the capacity to provide the links to emerging economies which can boost UK jobs, GDP and trade"".  ""It is clear the best solution for taxpayers, passengers and business is to build on the strength we already have at Heathrow,"" he said.  Mr Matthews said he had not ruled out a fourth runway at Heathrow, but said this would not be needed until at least 2040.  However, Mr Johnson said the proposals for a new runway at Heathrow ""were politically, environmentally and socially unacceptable"".  ""There will be more pigs flying than aircraft if we are to believe the claim that three runways at Heathrow will make less noise than two,"" he said.  Mr Johnson added the move ""would be a disastrous outcome for Londoners, nor would it solve our aviation capacity crisis as a fourth runway would need to be in the planning process before a third was even open"".  Greenpeace accused the airport of presenting a ""reheated and rehashed"" plan with the same ""flawed arguments that failed so categorically last time around"".  But business groups backed the plans, including the trade body which represents Britain's airlines.  The Board of Airline Representatives said no other proposal so far on airport capacity could ""deliver the UK's hub airport capacity quicker, at the right cost, or in the right place for airlines and their passengers""."
95,"The corpses were found at about 3,400m (11,500ft) on the mountain of San Matteo in the Trentino region.  The area was the scene of high-altitude fighting between Austrian and Italian forces towards the end of the war.  Historians believe the men may have died on 3 September 1918, during what was called ""the great battle"".  The preserved bodies were spotted and retrieved by Maurizio Vincenzi.  Not only is he an amateur historian, but he is also a member of the local mountain rescue team, and the director of the military history museum at the small town of Peio.  The museum announced the discovery on Sunday, after Mr Vincenzi and his colleagues recovered the bodies on Friday.  Mr Vincenzi, 46, said: ""Using binoculars, I saw what looked like a stain on the Forni glacier and went to look.""  ""When I got close, I discovered they were the bodies of soldiers frozen in the glacier. Nothing like this has ever happened in my lifetime. Bodies haven't been found in the ice around here for decades,"" he said.  Their uniforms included leather belts, a gas mask and a cap with a star on it - all in good condition.  It is thought the men may have died in a grenade attack.  The battle, 86 years ago, was won by the Austrians, but they lost 11 men in the process.  ""This is an important discovery from a historical point of view, and exciting for the communities on both sides of the border,"" said Mr Vicenzi.  A funeral for the men is planned for Tuesday afternoon, after which they will be laid to rest in the local military cemetery."
96,"Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant will build a new generation of Astra cars in an ""historic"" deal that will see it produce at least 160,000 cars a year.  About 700 jobs will be created at the plant, which employs 2,100, plus thousands more in the supply chain.  Owner General Motors announced it will invest £125m in the factory and spend about £1bn in the UK component sector.  It was feared that Ellesmere Port could shut under a GM restructuring plan that may still see a European plant close.  Vauxhall chairman Duncan Aldred said it was a ""ground-breaking, historic day"" for Ellesmere Port and the UK motor industry.  General Motors' investment in the UK motor industry - seemingly at the expense of rival plants in mainland Europe - bursts a few myths. Are not UK unions supposed to be inflexible to new labour agreements? Don't multinationals prefer to shut plants in the UK rather than mainland Europe because it is easier? And hasn't the country given up on manufacturing? There has been a bit of hyperbole around the Ellesmere Port news, but that is probably due to relief. For so long it seemed that the plant would close and 2,100 jobs go. Lost in the latest news about Vauxhall is another nugget of optimism. The number of cars built in the UK last month was almost 10% up on a year ago, boosted by strong export demand. Clearly, the wheels haven't come off UK manufacturing just yet.  Production of the new Astra will begin at the Cheshire plant in 2015 and run until at least 2020. After the investment, Ellesmere Port will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 cars annually.  Mr Aldred said Vauxhall would more than double the UK component content in the cars, spending £1bn with contractors, which he claimed would create 3,000 jobs in the supply chain.  As part of an agreement to invest in the factory, Vauxhall workers voted by 94% in favour of a new four-year pay and conditions deal that would enable the plant to work around the clock for 51 weeks of the year if necessary.  Mr Aldred described the flexibility of this deal as ""ground-breaking"".  He said: ""This is great news for the Ellesmere Port plant, our employees, the local community, our suppliers, the Vauxhall brand and the UK. We have been able to develop a responsible labour agreement that secures the plant's future.  ""This is assisted by the Government's industrial strategy, increasing its focus on the manufacturing sector and creating ideal ground for companies to build up long-term investments.""  Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, told the BBC that no financial inducements were offered to GM.  Mr Cable described the Astra news as ""a good story"" and said it underlined that the UK ""is a good business environment for the motor industry"".  He added: ""They [GM] wanted an assurance that the government was behind the industry, which we are. The car industry in the UK is a great success story.  ""This is a success for team working. We have had business, unions and government working together in a very productive partnership.""  The Unite union's general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""From a position of uncertainty earlier this year, there is now a potential for a future at the plant until 2020 and beyond.  ""Importantly this move will also bring component supplier plants back into the UK, a development that strengthens our manufacturing base generally.""  However, he said he recognised that Ellesmere Port's good news could spell bad news for other GM operations in Europe.  Vauxhall is the UK arm of Opel, GM's European unit. Since 1999, Opel has lost $11bn (£7bn), almost a quarter of it during the last two or three years.  Last year, Opel lost $750m and today's announcement about Ellesmere Port is expected to be accompanied by separate news that a factory in mainland Europe could be shut.  Analysts say that its carmaking capacity is out of step with demand. The company has been working on a restructuring plan for months.  There are fears in Germany that the Opel factory in Bochum is vulnerable to closure.  Bochum produces 30 cars an hour over three shifts a day. Ellesmere Port produces 47 cars an hour over two shifts a day - a company record.  But Germany could yet benefit from an expected decision to move production of its Chevrolet brand from Asia to Europe.  Ellesmere Port plant was thought to be vulnerable because it has traditionally been politically difficult to close plants in mainland Europe.  Analysts also say it is simply cheaper and easier to let workers go in the UK than elsewhere in Western Europe.  But the willingness of unions and workers at the plant to agree to more flexible working arrangements played an important role in GM's decision, as had the government's engagement on the issue in recent months.  In February, Mr Cable flew to the US and met GM's chief executive Dan Akerson and vice-chairman Steve Girsky.  He made the case for why GM should invest in the UK for the long term. Sources suggest the meeting may have played an important role in the company's ultimate decision to back the UK.  Although the government insists that it has not offered the company any up-front cash, there are several sources of money - including the Regional Growth Fund and the advanced manufacturing supply chain initiative - that the company may be able to access."
97,"The average rent on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan is £5,680 ($10,226) per square metre per year, according to Main Streets Across the World 2004.  Paris' Champs Elysees (£4,248) is the most expensive European street, followed by four London locations.  These are Oxford Street (£3,090), Bond Street (£3,036), Covent Garden (£2,848) and Brompton Road, home to Harrods.  Outside of London, Newcastle's Northumberland Street is the next most expensive shopping road in the UK, with an annual rent of £1,742 per square metre.  This is followed by Birmingham's High Street, Leeds' Commercial Street, Manchester's Market Street, Edinburgh's Princes Street and Glasgow's Buchanan Street.  Retailers on Dublin's Grafton Street (£2,279) pay more rent than anywhere in Germany, Australia or Japan.  But it is Fifth Avenue - or rather, a stretch of it - that continues to rule the roost.  ""This very specific stretch of Fifth Avenue only has around 55 stores in total,"" said Gene Spiegelman, a senior director at the company behind the report - US real estate giant Cushman & Wakefield Healey & Baker (C&W H&W).  ""The demand for retail positions here is huge as leading brands covet this location, eager to be associated with the glamour of the Fifth Avenue name.""  In Europe, rents on London's Bond Street experienced the biggest rise, rising from number six in the European rankings to number three, the report said.  Chris Phillips, head of London retail at C&W H&W, said Bond Street was now the number one European destination for luxury goods.  ""Its concentration of luxury and high fashion brands attracts wealthy shoppers from not just London, but from all over the world,"" he said.  The Main Streets Across the World 2004 study tracks retail rents in the world's top 229 shopping locations across 45 countries around the world."
98,"Three flights landed at Heathrow airport within five minutes of each other, watched by thousands of onlookers on Friday afternoon.  The last transatlantic flight carried 100 celebrities from New York and touched down at 1605 BST.  On disembarking, actress Joan Collins said there were ""cheers and tears"" among the passengers when the plane landed.  Minutes before the transatlantic trip touched down, competition winners landed on a flight from Edinburgh and a third completed its trip for invited guests around the Bay of Biscay.  British Airways decided to retire the famous aircraft after 27 years because it was no longer profitable.  Airport operator BAA built a 1,000-seat grandstand for spectators and many arrived at Heathrow hours before Concorde was due to arrive.  He said: ""Today is a very sad day but we must make the most of it. Concorde is potentially the most special thing man has ever built.""  There was also an emotional goodbye on the other side of the Atlantic.  Water cannon sprayed the Concorde with jets of red, white and blue water to evoke the colours of the British, American and French flags in a symbolic farewell on the runway at John F Kennedy airport.  Before entering the Concorde cockpit for the last time, Captain Mike Bannister said he was ""proud and privileged"" to fly the plane back from New York.  ""What we have tried to do is to make the retirement of Concorde a celebration - something that both the public and the airline can look back at with pride.  The New York flight left at at 1235 BST, another left Edinburgh at 1420 BST and a third began a loop of the Bay of Biscay a few minutes later.  Earlier, the first of the planes departed from Heathrow at 1035 BST for a flight to Edinburgh, where it landed at noon before leaving again for its final journey.  Actress Joan Collins, who has flown Concorde about 10 times and is on board the flight from New York, said the end of the era was ""tragic"".  ""The first time I ever flew Concorde was a bit of a white knuckle ride. I am more used to it now, it's so wonderful to make the journey in three and a half hours,"" she said as she boarded the plane.  British broadcaster and frequent flyer Sir David Frost said he had lost count of the number of times he had been on Concorde - ""somewhere between 300 and 500, I think.""  Model Jodie Kidd, checking into the flight, said: ""I always really love the rush of takeoff. I am just a speed freak.""  British Airways chief executive officer Rod Eddington said there was a ""mixture of sadness and celebration"" about the retirement.  ""It is a wonderful plane, an icon, but its time has come. It's an old plane - it doesn't look it - but it was designed in the 50s and built in the 60s,"" he told BBC One's Breakfast.  In 1956, Britain and France began working separately on an aircraft that would fly at twice the speed of sound.  BA and Air France made a joint announcement on the retirement in April and the French Concorde's final flight was in May.  Concorde never recovered after a horrific crash near Paris Charles de Gaulle airport three years ago, in which 113 people died."
99,"Artjon Shkurtaj asked for protection as a whistleblower after losing his job in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in North Korea.  Mr Shkurtaj said he found fake US bills in an office safe and local staff were paid in euros, and not local currency.  The UNDP denied any wrongdoing, and keeping improper accounts.  The agency has been accused by the US administration of handing over cash to the North Korean regime without proper accounting or paperwork, the BBC's Laura Trevelyan said from New York.  The implication is the UN allowed millions of dollars to go to the North Korean government instead of going to programmes to help people in poverty, our correspondent said.  The UN carried out an audit in June and said that while there had been breaches of rules, there had been no systematic diversion of UN money to North Korean authorities.  ""UNDP has invited the individual to submit all relevant information to the UNDP office charged with undertaking internal inquiries, but he has so far declined to do so,"" a spokesman from the agency said.  UN deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said the UN Ethics Office was looking into Mr Shkurtaj's appeal for whistleblower status."
100,"Plant donated money towards a bronze sculpture of the Welsh prince.  He was at Pennal church, near Machynlleth, when the tribute was revealed at a ceremony on Saturday.  But Plant, who owns a farmhouse in the area, wanted his visit to be low key.  His appearance was only made public three days after the unveiling of the Glyndwr bronze.  Plant became involved in the project through word of mouth. He is part of an Owain Glyndwr network and regularly attends meetings throughout Wales about the prince.  And he also supports heritage projects. The rock star is understood to have helped fund a slate carving of Glyndwr's coat of arms at the Celtica museum in Machynlleth.  Other stars donated cash towards the statue too, including Hollywood actress Julia Ormond, whose grandmother was from Pennal.  Rev Geraint ap Iorwerth, rector of St Peter ad Vincula Church in Pennal, said: ""Robert Plant, Julia Ormond and Ray Gravell all generously donated towards the statue.  ""I was glad that some of the statue's patrons, such as Robert and artist Aneurin Jones, could attend the unveiling on Saturday.  ""How many other people who've been dead for 600 years could draw together a rock star, a Hollywood actress, a rugby great and one of Wales' greatest artists as patrons of this project?""  He added: ""Julia Ormond's father's family are said to be direct descendants of Owain Glyndwr's sister and Julia also supported the statue appeal.  ""Julia's grandmother was from Pennal and was secretary of the Parochial Church Council in the 1930s.  ""Unfortunately, Julia couldn't be at Saturday's unveiling.""  In rock folklore, it is reputed that Plant and songwriting partner Jimmy Page penned the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's famous track, Stairway to Heaven, at his Powys home.  The rock star was unavailable for comment about his role in the statue project because of commitments overseas.  At a cost of £5,500, the bronze sculpture stands in the garden at St Peter ad Vincula Church.  The garden was also landscaped and cost £35,000. It was funded by the Welsh assembly, Gwynedd Council, and Snowdonia National Park Sustainability Fund.  It is in the style of a mediaeval monastic herb garden.  ""The statue by Dave Haynes, Bethesda, is the first ever bronze statue of Owain Glyndwr,"" added Rev ap Iorwerth.  Slate plaques to the Princes of Gwynedd's golden age of Owain Lawgoch - the last prince of the Royal House of Gwynedd, Glyndwr's clerical supporters of 1406, and Marged Glyndwr and her sons and daughters were also unveiled on Saturday.  St Peter Ad Vincula's (St Peter in Chains) sister church is the parish church of the Tower of London.  Founded in the 6th century, the church is renowned for its association with Glyndwr, who visited Pennal in 1406.  It was there he wrote the famous Pennal Letter to French King Charles IV calling for support for his rebellion.  The letter was never answered, but remained in the French national archive.  It is one of very few surviving examples of his handwriting and includes a copy of his seal.  The bronze was cast by Castle Fine Arts in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Powys, the company which crafted a statue of John Lennon for the airport which bears his name in Liverpool."
101,"Toshiba has filed its delayed financial results, warning that the company's survival is at risk.  ""There are material events and conditions that raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company said in a statement.  The electronics-to-construction giant reported a loss of 532bn yen (£3.8bn; $4.8bn) for April to December.  However, the results have not been approved by the firm's auditors.  These latest financial results have already been delayed twice and raise the possibility that Toshiba could be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Toshiba's president, Satoshi Tsunakawa, apologised for the problems facing the firm and called the auditor's decision not to approve the financial report as ""truly regrettable"".  He said he hoped the company would not be delisted.  Toshiba, originally known for its consumer electronics products, has faced a series of difficulties.  An accounting scandal, uncovered in 2015, led to the resignation of several members of the firm's senior management, including the chief executive, after the company was found to have inflated the previous seven years' profits by $1.2bn.  Its problems came to a head again in January this year, when it became clear its US nuclear unit, Westinghouse, was in financial trouble.  Westinghouse was put into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, which protects it from creditors while it undergoes restructuring.  This week, Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn was reported to be willing to pay up to $27bn (£21.7bn) for Toshiba's computer chip business, a move which could help shore up the losses if it went ahead.  But that has not been enough to resolve Toshiba's difficulties.  The firm's auditors, PriceWaterhouseCooper Aarata, have refused to sign off the company's accounts, resulting in their publication being delayed twice.  Now, faced with a deadline, Toshiba has made the unprecedented move of publishing the results without the auditor's approval.  Toshiba's statement added: ""At the present time, substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern exists as of the filing date of the quarterly report.""  The loss reported is for the first nine months of Toshiba's financial year, covering April to December 2016.

103,"Attitudes then and now The Royal Navy of Nelson's period has generally been painted in terms of men being pressed into service against their will, living in hellish conditions, and being tyrannised with the lash. As one historian has put it, the sailors toiled on a sort of 'floating concentration camp'. It would seem unlikely, however, that men pressed and beaten into servitude would provide the manpower that delivered such crushing victories as the battles of the Nile (1798) and Trafalgar (1805), and current research is doing much to re-cast the lives of the men and women of the lower deck. This new perspective shows a much more complex, rounded picture of life in Nelson's Navy. In Nelson's time Admiralty Regulations stated that women were not allowed to be taken to sea ... In Nelson's time Admiralty Regulations stated that women were not allowed to be taken to sea and that '... no women be ever permitted to be on board but such as are really the wives of the men they come to, and the ship not too much pestered even with them'. Whatever the rulebook said, however, it is nevertheless clear that women did travel aboard Nelson's ships - and in large numbers, although senior officers were not necessarily in favour of this. When a great personal friend of Nelson, Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, discovered that women had been brought onboard his flagship, he ordered the women ashore because of '... the mischief they never fail to create wherever they are'. He also wrote that 'I never knew a woman brought to sea in a ship that some mischief did not befall the vessel'. The Earl Saint Vincent, another friend of Nelson's, was also against women coming to sea, largely due to their washing their clothes in the ship's fresh water. In our own day, following some passionate debate, official attitudes towards women serving onboard Royal Navy vessels have recently changed. In 1993 women were officially allowed to go to sea onboard Royal Navy vessels, and the current Equal Opportunities Policy of the Royal Navy states that: 'As a result of changes to employment practice from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the percentage of women entering the Armed Forces doubled, and today 20 per cent of officer entrants are female'.  In Nelson's navy, warrant officers were the ship's specialist officers, and included the carpenter, gunner, cooper, purser and master (the person responsible for the ship's navigation and sailing). Their name comes from the fact that they received a warrant from the Admiralty, rather than a commission, which is what the captain and his lieutenants received. A number of these men took their wives and children to sea with them. The presence of the women was largely hidden, for official purposes, as they were not paid or fed by the Navy, and therefore were not entered onto the ships' muster books. However other records, such as order books written by ships' captains, refer to their existence, as do memoirs and records of courts martial. The presence of the women was largely hidden, for official purposes ... The story of George Casey, his wife, and Nicholas Maeger is a good example. On Friday 5 January 1797, Commodore Horatio Nelson was presiding over the court martial of Lieutenant Nicholas Meager of HMS Dromedary. Lieutenant Meager was charged by George Casey, the ship's Master, because he '... took hold of me by the nose and pulled with all his strength', in public view on the deck of the ship. Prior to the attack one witness recalled that 'I was walking on the larboard [left] side of the quarter deck, Mr Casey and his wife were walking on the starboard [right] side, the prisoner [Meager] came out of his cabin and as he passed Mrs Casey he spit in her face'. It is not recorded why Maeger spat in Mrs Casey's face, but this record attests to the fact that a warrant officer had his wife with him while at sea, was promenading with her in public view, and the court saw nothing unusual in this. And what is more, in a separate court martial also involving Casey and Maeger, it came to light that the Caseys also had a child, which stayed onboard with them.  Whenever Royal Navy ships of the period came into port, an armada of 'bumboats' immediately besieged them. Bumboats were small vessels that brought fresh vegetables, supplies and, most notoriously, prostitutes and drink to the warships. In port, most ships' captains allowed prostitutes onboard, and the men were in any case already issued with large quantities of drink - the standard allowance was a gallon of beer a man per day. If beer was not available, then a pint of wine or half a pint of spirits could be substituted. The warships of the day were very overcrowded, and each man was only allowed 14 inches in which to hang his hammock. Add large numbers of prostitutes to the overcrowding and heavy drinking, and the scenes below decks where the men lived must have been something to behold. A sailor wrote that, 'with the women came drink and what with the drink and the women the ship's discipline came to a stop. The men and women drank and quarrelled between the guns. The decks were allowed to become dirty. Drunken women were continually coming up to insult the officers, or to lodge some complaint. Sometimes the women ran aloft to wave their petticoats to the flagship'. Other women, disguised as men, are also known to have entered the Royal Navy, and to have served for some considerable time without detection. Much has been written about them, and while some of these stories are likely to be folk myths, there are a number of attested cases in which the women involved became minor celebrities. For instance Hanna Snell, the daughter of a dyer from Worcester, enlisted in the army in 1745, deserted, and then enlisted in the marines - who were shipboard soldiers (later to become the Royal Marines) who helped keep discipline onboard ship. Hanna saw action in this capacity, and was eventually badly wounded in both thighs. Despite this, her true sex was never identified, and she recovered from her wounds. In 1750 she revealed her true identity, became a celebrity and starred on the stage.  Royal Navy ships were constantly carrying passengers on board. These could be government officials coming or going to foreign stations, discharged invalids going home, or soldiers being transferred from one post to another - and a number of them were women. Out of every 100 men, three soldiers were allowed to bring their wives ... During the 1801 Egyptian campaign, over 60 Royal Navy vessels carried and escorted 12,000 troops to Aboukir Bay, Egypt, in an attempt to drive French forces out of Egypt. Out of every 100 men, three soldiers were allowed to bring their wives, which meant that there were at least 360 women in the fleet, as well as their children. These women and children are recorded in the ships' muster books. For instance the muster book of HMS Charon records that there were 30 women and 20 children onboard 'belonging to the 30th Regiment [now the Queen's Lancashire Regiment]'. After the successful landing in Aboukir Bay, many of the troopships were turned into hospital ships, and although some of the women and children left to join the army now camped ashore, many stayed on board ship, and volunteered to act as nurses to the sick and wounded. In appreciation of this, Admiral Lord Keith, the expedition's naval commander, allowed them to be fed from the ships' stores, and encouraged them to volunteer for this service. The Royal Navy of the time had a comprehensive health care system, which included compulsory vaccination against smallpox, free medical treatment for sailors, a sick bay and a surgeon on every ship - as well as an extensive network of hospitals and hospital ships. However, the nurses who attended the sick and wounded at these establishments had quite a bad reputation, and were continually being sacked for prostitution, drunkenness and helping the sailors desert. One sailor wrote that, '... those ladies are exceedingly bold and audacious ... I had a great deal to do to repulse the temptations I met with from these sirens'.  In 2000, Italian archaeologist Dr Paolo Gallo, while excavating Hellenistic and Pharaonic structures on Nelson's Island, Aboukir Bay, discovered a lost Royal Navy burial ground from Nelson's time. A British team was invited by Dr Gallo to excavate these burials, which subsequently revealed graves containing officers, sailors, soldiers, marines, women and children. A poignant discovery was that of three infants. Two were either stillborn or had died shortly after birth, and one had died at just a few months old. Each was buried in a wooden coffin, wrapped in a shroud held together with small bronze pins, and one had been carefully packed in wood shavings. ... women fought, nursed, accompanied their husbands ... and even enlisted in disguise to serve in Nelson's Navy Directly next to one infant was the grave of a woman in a wooden coffin, and it is likely that this was her child. She had been laid to rest in a dress, and her face had been covered with what looks like a handkerchief. On the coffin lid had been nailed a large metal letter 'G'. There are currently three possible candidates for this burial. John Nicol, one of Nelson's sailors who took part in the Battle of the Nile (1798), wrote that a woman from Leith, Scotland, was injured whilst serving the guns on HMS Goliath, subsequently died of her wounds, and was 'buried on a small island in the Bay'. Two other women from the army regiments from the 1801 expedition were recorded to have died on board the ships moored in Aboukir Bay. One was Mrs Lambe, of the 3rd Guards Regiment (now the Scots Guards), and the other was Sarah Webber of the Coldstream Guards. Any one of these could have merited the mysterious 'G' (standing perhaps for 'Goliath' or 'Guards'). The historical and archaeological record thus makes it clear that women fought, nursed, accompanied their husbands, gave birth, entertained and even enlisted in disguise to serve in Nelson's Navy. These findings have forced us to re-examine the social and organisational nature of Nelson's crews, and has painted a much fuller and more complex picture of those who inhabited the 'wooden world'."
104,"Carlisle United have revealed plans to move from their Brunton Park home to a new stadium at Kingmoor in the north of the city.  The plans that would see a new 12,000 all-seater stadium built, ending a 102-year stay at their present home, were revealed to shareholders on Thursday.  Funding for the venue and surrounding buildings under the proposals would come from a development partner.  In addition, the new stadium would have office and training facilities.  A feasibility study found that the club's current site was a costly and unsuitable option for redevelopment.  Kingmoor Park was recommended by the study from 17 potential sites.  ""Everyone was very happy with the proposal,"" CUFC Online independent website editor Tim Graham told BBC Radio Cumbria, having attended the meeting.  ""From what the board were saying and the feasibity study, everyone in the meeting was for it.  ""Once everyone realises what's involved with it, I think a lot of people will be for it to be honest.""  The Cumbrians' existing ground meets the criteria set by the Football League to play in the bottom two tiers, but would not be suitable under regulations beyond that for the Championship.  ""Football League regulations, released in 2009, stipulated minimum ground standards which we are currently struggling to meet within Brunton Park,"" chairman John Nixon said within the statement.  ""The board would be doing a disservice to the fans if we didn't look into the future options for the club and report back to them for their input.""  Carlisle's next step is to present the findings and results of the study to supporters, which will take place on 24 November."
105,"Premium bond holders are being offered a 50% increase in their prizes Competition for savers' money is being stepped up with a 50% rise in the prize money on offer to Premium Bond holders. National Savings & Investments (NS&I) will increase the prize fund payout rate from 1% to 1.5% in October, taking the total payout from £33.8m to £52.5m. The prize rate is normally adjusted along with Bank of England's interest rate. In March NS&I cut its prize rate from 1.8% to 1%. There are 23 million people with Premium Bonds, with £40bn invested. ""NS&I reviews the interest rates on all of its savings products each month to ensure it continues to balance the interests of its savers, the taxpayer and the stability of the wider financial services market,"" said Peter Cornish of National Savings. NS&I exists to borrow money from the public to help fund government spending. In the wake of the collapse of Northern Rock bank in the autumn of 2007, and the banking crisis a year ago, public money flooded into NS&I policies - including Premium Bonds and other accounts - as people looked for an absolutely safe home for their savings. But after NS&I exceeded its fund raising target in the last financial year, 2008/09, the savings trend has reversed. In the first three months of the 2009/10 year, NS&I saw a net outflow of money as people responded to higher rates available from banks and building societies, or preferred to use their money to spend or to pay off debts. During that quarter there was a £4.5bn gross outflow of cash, which outstripped new inflows of £3.2bn. The average rate on a bank or building society notice account has almost doubled in the past month to 0.43%, according to figures from the Bank of England. And bank and building society fixed rate accounts, usually known as bonds, offer an average of 3.03%. According to the financial information service Moneyfacts, the top bond rates on offer to savers range from 3.85% for one year with the Post Office, to 4.65% for three years from the Yorkshire Building Society, and 5.4% for five years from Aldermore. In May, NS&I raised the interest rate on its own instant access savings account, known as an income bond, by 1%.     "
106,"The chancellor of a university has apologised over the hiring of a PR firm that promised to bury online search results about the pepper spraying of peaceful protesters.  Dr Linda Katehi admitted that UC Davis, California, brought in a company ""specialising in what is known as search engine optimisation"".  But she denied that the institution had sought to ""rewrite history"".  Dr Katehi has faced calls to resign over the 2011 incident and its fallout.  Earlier this month, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported that UC Davis hired the PR firm Nevins and Associates on a six-month contract at $15,000 (£10,400) per month.  The university was seeking to deal with the reaction to the incident in 2011 in which students who were protesting on the university's campus, near Sacramento, in California, were pepper-sprayed by a campus police officer.  The paper published a document which it said set out the firm's proposed strategy. The document read: ""Nevins and Associates is prepared to create and execute an online branding campaign designed to clean up the negative attention the University of California, Davis, and Chancellor Katehi have received related to the events that transpired in November 2011.""  The document also referred to ""eradication of references to the pepper spray incident in search results on Google for the university and the Chancellor"" via an ""aggressive and comprehensive online campaign to eliminate the negative search results"".  In a statement published on the university's website this week, Dr Katehi said: ""In hindsight, we should have been more careful in reviewing some of the more unrealistic and ridiculous scope-of-work claims in the written proposals of our outside vendors.  ""What might be accepted industry hyperbole in the private public relations world falls far beneath the high standards of a public institution of higher learning.""  The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the University of California's student association had called on Dr Katehi to resign over the news.  In her statement, Dr Katehi acknowledged that an extra $1.6m (£1.1m) had been pumped into the institution's communications budget recently. She cited examples of the university's good works and said that any organisation in its position would seek to ensure those were highlighted."
107,"Around 1,200 people are thought to have attended the wedding of Emmanuele Filiberto and Clotilde Courau.  The bride, who is six months pregnant, was initially viewed with disaste by Filiberto's father, Vittorio Emmanuel, because of her left-wing views.  The event has been given extensive media coverage and was shown live on Sky TV. It has been dubbed the ""wedding of the year"".  Courau sported a Valentino dress, a veil held in place by a diamond tiara and gems belonging to the House of Savoy.  She held a tumbling bouquet of pink roses as she walked down the aisle with her father.  Both were moved to tears on several occasions.  Prince Albert of Monaco, who introduced the couple three years ago, was the best man.  Celebrities such as French rock singer Jonny Hallyday and fashion designer Pierre Cardin were in attendance, as were a number of Italian aristocrats.  The basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels, built on the ruins of the Diocletian baths, is where Filiberto's great grandfather King Victor Emmanuel III married Helen of Montenegro in 1896.  The 31-year-old banker has said media reports that his fiancee was an ""anarcho-communist"" were speculation.  Courau has said she will continue to work as an actress.  ""I will work under my name and I will be Clotilde of Savoy to advance humanitarian causes,"" she told the newspaper Corriere della Sera on Thursday.  Both have stressed that they married for love.  ""Our love is strong, it will carry us far,"" Courau told the newspaper.  They also say they do not want to be treated as royalty.  A constitutional ban which kept the male Savoy heirs out of Italy for more than half a century was lifted late last year at the same time as the family condemned Mussolini's race laws.  The last Savoy monarch approved the laws which marked the start of the persecution and deportation of Italian Jews during World War II."

110,"Sweden is the seventh country to allow gay marriage Sweden will allow gay couples to be legally married from next month. Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to recognise same-sex marriage, becoming the fifth country in Europe to do so. Sweden was one of the first countries to give gay couples legal ""partnership"" rights, in the mid-1990s, and allowed them to adopt children from 2002. The new law lets homosexuals wed in either a civil or religious ceremony, though individual churches can opt out. The law was passed by 226 votes to 22 and will come into force on 1 May. These are the years that legislation was passed by parliament ""The decision means that gender no longer has an impact on the ability to marry and that the law on registered partnership is repealed,"" the government said on its website. Six of the seven parties in parliament backed the bill, while the Christian Democrats, one of four parties in the governing coalition, refused. The Lutheran Church, the largest church in Sweden, has offered to bless gay partnerships since January 2007, but has still not given formal backing to the term ""marriage"", and will allow individual pastors to refuse to carry out gay weddings. Sweden has become the fifth European country, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Norway, to recognise same-sex marriage. Elsewhere, Canada and South Africa have also passed such legislation, as have some US states and local authorities in other countries.     "
111,"The BBC News website profiles the most prominent figures on each side.  He is seen by many as the country's political weathervane - consistently emerging on the winning side through the twists and turns of the 1975-90 civil war and its troubled aftermath.  He was a supporter of Syria after the war but, since the death of strongman Hafez al-Assad in 2000, he has campaigned for Damascus to relinquish control. Jumblatt has spoken openly of the fear that he - like murdered former PM Rafik Hariri - may face assassination because of this stance.  He not only commands the loyalty of members of the Druze community - a secretive offshoot of Shia Islam whose adherents make up about 10% of the population - but is admired by members of other religious minorities in Lebanon.  Many supporters of the ""Cedar revolution"" - the protest in central Beirut calling for Syrian withdrawal - are also supporters of Aoun, who has continued to campaign against Damascus from his Paris home.  But his critics see him as a proponent of Christian supremacy in Lebanon.  He has said he will return to his homeland before elections this year, despite risking arrest for alleged offences during his period as a rebel prime minister and warlord.  But his powers to govern were severely circumscribed by the Israeli and Syrian occupation of most of his country.  He arrived back in Lebanon in 2000 after 12 years of self-imposed exile, to join the opposition to President Lahoud's pro-Syrian government. But he was expelled from the Phalange, which takes a more moderate view towards the Syrians now than in the past.  Gemayel hit the headlines in March 2003, when he launched a doomed eleventh-hour attempt to mediate a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.  He is now a member of the Qornet Shehwan group of Christian politicians dedicated to bringing about a withdrawal of Syrian forces  At the beginning of the 1990s he supported Syria's role against the rebel General Michel Aoun.  He began demanding Syrian withdrawal towards the end of the decade, before falling silent again just as anti-Syrian views were becoming more widespread.  He has backed the process whereby Damascus says it will withdraw its forces, but has also called for Lebanon to focus on its economic development rather than political rifts.  He was elected by parliament in 1998 after a Syrian-backed constitutional change - allowing public employees to stand for office. In 2004 Damascus steamrollered another amendment through parliament to give him a three-year extension in office.  This move triggered the current crisis that has split Lebanon into pro- and anti-Syrian camps. The divisions were exacerbated by the killing of Rafik Hariri in February, who had resigned from the prime ministership in protest over this issue.  Despite owing much to Iran and Syria for Hezbollah's original funding and its continuing logistical support, he has always assiduously played the Lebanese unity card.  Hezbollah took the credit in Lebanon for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. Since, Nasrallah has won plaudits by fostering national unity rather than indulging in Shia triumphalism.  This was particularly evident in the huge pro-Syrian rallies Hezbollah has organised - where not one of its distinctive yellow-and-green flags was visible in a sea of Lebanese red, white and green.  He rejects UN Resolution 1559, which calls for the withdrawal of non-Lebanese forces (ie Syria) and the disbanding of armed militias (ie Hezbollah), on the grounds that Syrian and Lebanese interests are linked and should not be decided by outside forces.  A lawyer by profession, he entered politics in 1987 after the death of his brother - the eight-time Arab nationalist prime minister Rashid Karami - who was killed in a bomb explosion on his helicopter while still prime minister.  He owes his position to backing from Damascus and is a staunch supporter of Syria's influence in Lebanon's politics.  As head of the Amal militia, whose stronghold is in his native southern Lebanon, Berri is seen as little more than a puppet of Syria.  The ascendancy of Hezbollah has eroded his position, but he remains a shrewd political operator and Damascus has continued to keep him at a comparable rank to his more illustrious Shia rival Nasrallah."

113,"Bookies have installed Mercury Prize-nominee PJ Harvey as joint favourite alongside Adele to win this year's prestigious trophy and its £20,000 prize money.  Her album Let England Shake is her fourth nomination but she also won the award in 2001 for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea.  It makes her the most successful artist in the prize's history (Radiohead have also been nominated for four but have failed to win).  Let England Shake documents man's self-destructive propensity for war and Harvey spent two years researching warfare, in particular the first world war.  The Guardian's five-star review called it a richly inventive album that's unlike anything else in Harvey's back catalogue.  I found out on the day. Obviously, I knew that the announcement was coming up and I hoped that the record would make it in because, for me, I think it's probably one of my best pieces of work.  It's always wonderful to have some recognition and the Mercury prize is a good platform for that and I'm just really delighted that it's been acknowledged.  I've never been the sort of person to think too much about those sorts of things or to think about how I am perceived because the most important thing is to concentrate on my work and improve at it.  I find that quite all-consuming and it's much healthier for me as a person to keep that as my focus and judge my work by how I feel about it and what my aims were initially and if I feel I achieved that, rather than by what other people think of it.  I always try and keep up to date with all types of new music. I make that part of my work actually, I think it's important to know what sphere you're operating in as an artist. So yes, I keep up to date.  Having said that, there's very little that I find of interest and I tend to go back to the music that's always fed and nourished me for inspiration.  I do have an appalling memory and I think the first nomination was for Rid Of Me, and I really can't remember anything about it. I can't even remember going. Did I go? I don't think I was there, I was probably on tour - we did very lengthy tours in the early days. I've a vague memory of being invited and being in another part of the world.  Quite naturally I look back at that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day - it didn't have much importance in the grand scheme of things.  Still, it was a monumental day which I'll never forget. Doing the acceptance down a telephone, I remember vividly looking out of the window at armoured tanks driving up and down outside our hotel and whole city was on lockdown. We weren't allowed to leave Washington until late that night to get to our next show.  It was a very surreal day.  It's really astonishing, actually, how much people have wanted to come and tell me what the record means to them and how much it's affected their lives. It's really overwhelmed me and that's been from all walks of life, whether they have been involved in war zones or not.  But there have been people that have worked with refugees in east Timor, war veterans from as far afield as New Zealand and Australia - people just reaching out to want to say, 'thank you, this means a lot to me,' so it continues to humble me, it's wonderful to get feedback like that"
114,"The husband of the Danish queen is returning home on Tuesday, three weeks after quitting the country for his native France.    I can confirm that he will be flying back from France today    Prince Consort Henrik left Denmark claiming that his status in the royal family had been downgraded, and saying he wanted to ""reflect"" on life. His departure sparked rumours of a possible royal marriage split, but Queen Margrethe went to visit him at his chateau at Caix in southern France, and the couple told journalists they were happy to be together. ""I can confirm that he will be flying back from France today,"" a palace official told BBC News Online on Tuesday. The 67-year-old prince was reported to be ""no longer downcast"". He is expected to resume his role in public life. The incident which sparked Prince Henrik's departure was a royal reception on New Year's Day, at which the couple's son, Crown Prince Frederik, was given higher status than he was. He told a Danish tabloid newspaper, BT, that royal staff had shunted him into ""third place in the royal hierarchy"" behind Crown Prince Frederik. He had felt ""pushed aside, degraded and humiliated"", the newspaper reported, and his self-respect was being destroyed. ""For many years I have been Denmark's number two,"" he said. ""I've been satisfied with that role, but I don't want to be relegated to number three after so many years."" He changed his name to Henrik as a mark of respect for the Danes, but in his newspaper interview he said the Danish people had never accepted him despite 35 years of marriage. Prince Frederik had told the Danish paper that his father was unwell, and needed to ""remain calm"". The crisis-hit family have had one piece of good news. Prince Joachim and his wife, Princess Alexandra, announced last Friday that their second baby was due in August. The couple already have two-year-old child, Nikolai."

Blackburn's spokesman confirmed reports of a conflict between the DJ and the station over its musical policy.  But on Tuesday he played the singer's 1963 number one Summer Holiday, leading to an e-mail from head of programmes Paul Baker.  ""We shouldn't be playing Cliff Richard,"" Mr Baker wrote. ""We might carry out research on him, but for now we have a policy decision that he doesn't match our brand values. He's not on the playlist, and you must stop playing him.""  On his Wednesday breakfast show, Blackburn read a print-out of the e-mail live on air. He then tore it up, threw it in the bin and played two more chart-toppers by Sir Cliff - Living Doll (1959) and We Don't Talk Any More (1979).  Classic Gold managing director John Baish e-mailed him immediately, warning: ""This is really serious now.""  He followed it up with an e-mail confirming Blackburn's suspension.  ""You're consistently breaking the station's music policy. We've made our position as clear as we could. I've got no option except to suspend you until the situation can be resolved,"" he wrote.  Blackburn's spokesman said the 61-year-old DJ was ""sorry"" about defying the station's wishes.  ""He respects the management's decision - he isn't here to cause a massive row,"" he said.  ""He's disappointed obviously - he's been broadcasting for 40 years now.""  Mr Baish said Blackburn would not be doing his show on Thursday to allow the two sides ""breathing space"" to settle their differences.  ""Tony believes Cliff has some great songs and was trying to test out public support,"" he said. ""Doing it on air isn't the best way to take those decisions - we have some very sophisticated research.""  Mr Baish added: ""We should be able to sort this out. I'm not angry. I love Tony - really, he's a sweetheart.""  Blackburn joined the breakfast show in May last year and has an audience of 400,000 listeners.  Blackburn was voted Oldie of the Year in 2003 and won the 2002 edition of TV reality show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here."
116,"   The Roots of Slavery      The term slave has its origins in the word slav. The slavs, who inhabited a large part of Eastern Europe, were taken as slaves by the Muslims of Spain during the ninth century AD.      Slavery can broadly be described as the ownership, buying and selling of human beings for the purpose of forced and unpaid labour. It is an ancient practice, mentioned in both the Bible and the Koran. As for those of your slaves which wish to buy their liberty, free them if you find in them any promise and bestow on them a part of the riches which God has given you.          Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.          Indeed, the main religious texts of Judaism, Islam and Christianity all recognise slaves as a separate class of people in society. Going back further in time the Mayans and Aztecs kept slaves in the Americas, as did the Sumerians and Babylonians in the Near East. The Egyptians employed huge numbers of slaves, including the Jews, Europeans and Ethiopians.      The Greeks and Romans kept slaves as soldiers, servants, labourers and even civil servants. The Romans captured slaves from what is now Britain, France and Germany. Slave armies were kept by the Ottomans and Egyptians.     In Imperial Russia in the first half of the 19th century one third of the population were serfs, who like slaves in the Americas, had the status of chattels and could be bought and sold. They were finally freed in 1861 by Emperor Alexander II. Four years later slavery was abolished in the southern states of America following southern defeat in the American Civil War.     In Africa there were a number of societies and kingdoms which kept slaves, before there was any regular commercial contact with Europeans, including the Asanti, the Kings of Bonny and Dahomey.

117,"China is on course to becoming a superpower - but not in the way many expect, writes economist Martin Jacques.  Beijing these days is positively throbbing with debate. It may not have the trappings of a western-style democracy, but it is now home to the most important and interesting discussions in the world.  When I addressed an audience of young Chinese diplomats at their foreign ministry a year ago, it was abundantly clear that a fascinating debate is under way about what kind of foreign policy might be appropriate for the global power China is in the process of becoming.  What will China be like as a superpower? You might think it is already - it is not.  Its military power is puny compared with that of the US. While America has 11 aircraft carriers, China only commissioned its first last month - based on, of all things, a Ukrainian hull.  And its global political influence is still extremely limited.  The only sense in which China is a superpower is economic - that is, its economy is already over half the size of the US economy and projected to overtake it around 2018, notwithstanding its reduced growth rate of 7%. But this is overwhelmingly a function of China's huge population. In terms of technology and living standards it lags far behind the US.  So when we speak of China as a superpower, we are talking about the future.  A common reaction to the idea of China as a superpower is that it will be like the US - except worse. Worse because it is not a democracy, it has a communist government and because its people are not like us. I guess that gives some the jitters.  In fact we should not expect China to behave in the manner of the US. It will be very different. And nor should we assume that it will necessarily be worse.  Why will it be different? Because its history is so different. Articles about China's growing involvement with Africa - in terms of trade and investment - often talk of the ""new colonialism"".  Beware historical ignorance. China has never colonised any overseas territories. Overseas empires were a European speciality, with Japan getting in on the act for a short while too.  China could have colonised South East Asia, for example, in the early 15th century. It had the resources, it had enormous ships, many times bigger than anything Europe possessed at the time. But it didn't.  That is not to say China ignored its neighbours. On the contrary. For many, many centuries it dominated them - as a result of its sheer size and far more advanced level of development. China's relationship with them was based not on colonialism but what we now know as the tributary system. It neither ruled them nor occupied them. Rather, in return for access to the Chinese market and various forms of protection, the rulers of tribute states were required to give gifts - literally tribute - to the Emperor as a symbolic acknowledgement of China's superiority.  The tributary system comprised what we know today as East Asia, home to one-third of the world's population. It stretched from Japan and Korea to the Malay Peninsula and parts of Indonesia.  It proved remarkably stable, lasting for at least 2,000 years and only coming to an end around 1900.  The West and China share an important characteristic - they both believe they are universal, a model for all others. But the way they have interpreted this in practice has been entirely different. For Europe, and latterly the US, it meant projecting their power around the world, most spectacularly during the heyday of colonialism in the 19th and first half of the 20th Century, when a large part of the world found itself under European rule.  We governed from afar, exported our ways of doing things, imposed our languages, our education, our religion and much else besides.  The Chinese, in contrast, preferred to stay at home. They believed the Middle Kingdom, the old name for China, literally meaning the centre of the world, was the highest form of civilisation. So why step outside into ever darkening shades of barbarianism?  The seven great voyages of Zheng He between 1405 and 1433 around the East and South China Seas and across the Indian Ocean as far as East Africa left no permanent mark - they were about demonstrating the glory of the Middle Kingdom rather than a desire to conquer. Those who left China to settle in South East Asia were seen as leaving civilisation and deserving of no support or protection by the Emperor.  Compare that with the way in which Britain and France celebrated the heroes of their colonial expansion. Our cities are littered with statues and street names in their memory.  There is another reason why the Chinese have tended to stay at home. The country is huge, diverse - and extremely difficult to govern. The overwhelming preoccupation of its rulers down the ages has been how to maintain order and stability and thereby retain power. It remains just as true today.  Rather than look outwards, China's leaders look inwards. The exception was China's own continental land mass. Its expansion, rather than to the four corners of the world, was confined to its own continent.  The most dramatic example was the westward march of the Qing dynasty from the mid-17th Century which, in a series of bloody and brutal wars, doubled the physical size of China.  So what, you might ask, does all this history tell us about how China might behave as a great global power? A great deal.  Europe, I would argue, has historically been an extremely aggressive and expansionist continent. Its own history has been characterised by seemingly endless wars which were then transplanted onto a global stage during the era of colonial expansion and world war. Military might, the projection of power around the world, and the desire if necessary by force to impose our way of life on others, have been fundamental to the European story.  And it is not difficult to see how the US - itself the product of European overseas expansion and settlement - inherited these characteristics from us.  China won't be like this. It is not in its DNA. Its rulers will be far less interested in seeking to dominate the rest of the world and far more concerned with keeping themselves in power. That is what ruling a country containing a fifth of the world's population obliges. When Xi Jinping becomes Chinese leader next month, his in-tray, as with Hu Jintao before him, will be overwhelmingly filled with domestic rather than foreign issues.  In time China will certainly come to enjoy huge global power. It will be exercised, however, in a rather different way.  The iconic form of western power has been military. Extraordinarily, the US today accounts for around half of global defence expenditure. Before, European colonial expansion was only possible because its fighting capacity was massively superior to that of the rest of the world.  That kind of overweening military power has never really been a Chinese characteristic.  Instead the quintessential forms of Chinese power will be economic and cultural. Over time, China's economic strength - given the size of its population - will be gigantic, far greater than that of the US at its zenith. Already, even at its present low level of development, China is the main trading partner of a multitude of countries around the world. And with economic power will come commensurate political power and influence. China will, if it wishes, be able to bend many other countries to its will.  Cultural power will also be important to the Chinese. Theirs is a remarkable civilisation - having enjoyed a place in the sun not once but several times. During the Tang dynasty, for instance, from the 7th to the 10th Century, and most remarkably during the Song dynasty from the 10th to the 13th Century, with major advances in a host of fields from biology and hydraulic engineering to architecture, medicine, mathematics and cartography.  The Chinese are enormously proud of their historical achievements. They believe that theirs is the greatest civilisation there has ever been.  They have a strong sense of their own superiority rooted in history. They have long had a hierarchical view of the world, with China at the top. And the rise of China is likely to accentuate these views.  But don't expect the Chinese to be impatient about their rise. In 1972 Henry Kissinger is reputed to have asked Zhou En Lai, the former Chinese premier, what he thought of the French Revolution. Zhou En Lai's response: ""It's too early to know"".  The Chinese have a completely different conception of time to Westerners. Whereas Americans think very short, the Chinese think very long.  For them a century is nothing."
118,"Jodrell Bank has unveiled a brand new £3m discovery centre at its base in Cheshire.  Home to the Lovell telescope, the observatory attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year.  Jodrell Bank said the centre would help people to learn more about the Universe and the work done by its astronomers.  The site was recently shortlisted for World Heritage status and chosen as headquarters for the world's biggest telescope, the Square Kilometre Array.  The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics is the astronomical research centre of the University of Manchester.  Director of the discovery centre, Dr Teresa Anderson, said its aim was to educate visitors about the live science carried out by the Jodrell Bank team.  ""When people come, they want to know what the telescope is doing, what the scientists are doing so we've structured everything to the questions that people ask,"" she said.  Dr Anderson added that the centre would be much more ""hands on"".  ""You will be able to touch a piece of rock that's come from outer space,"" she said.  ""It's 4.5 billion years old and it fell to Earth 4,000 years ago.""  The centre comprises a Planet Pavilion which includes a glass-walled cafe overlooking the Lovell Telescope and a Space Pavilion for events and exhibitions.  The project was funded with £1.9m from the North West Development Agency (NWDA) and £1m European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  An additional £600,000 has been pledged by the University of Manchester.  Nick Brook-Sykes, NWDA's Director of Tourism, said: ""Jodrell Bank is already an icon in the North West and a visitor attraction in its own right, but it has the potential to attract many more national and international visitors to the region.  ""This investment will help create a richer, more inspiring visitor experience which is more fitting to this beacon of science and research.""  The new facility replaces Jodrell Bank's original visitor centre which was demolished in 2003.  The Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre opens to the public on Monday 11 April."
119,"Sharp pieces of coal fly across a narrow, dark, airless space as a man bangs the wall of the cave with his hammer.  A slim boy sits crouched in the corner, waiting for the miner to fill his sack. Once full, he throws it behind his back, slouches, and starts his journey along a narrow, mucky pathway back into the sunlight.  The boy, Kylych, is one of dozens, possibly hundreds of children working in the abandoned Soviet-era coal mines in the mountains of southern Kyrgyzstan.  He knows what he does is extremely dangerous. He says he has seen his friends die and has been trapped inside himself.  But, he says, he has no choice. The US$3 a day he makes is crucial to his family's survival.  ""I'd rather go to school, of course, but I need to help the family,"" he says.  Like many of its neighbours, Kyrgyzstan never recovered from the collapse of the Soviet Union, which destroyed, among other things, the country's once-thriving mining industry.  The coal mines were abandoned, and the infrastructure left lying in ruins.  After years of watching the government fail to revive the economy, people turned to excavating coal themselves. But the mines they dug out were often too narrow for adults, and so fathers began bringing in their sons.  No one knows the exact number of children working in Kyrgyzstan's coal mines.  Locals say the government refuses to acknowledge the problem. Officially these children may not even exist. Yet we saw them at every coal mine we visited.  They work all year round, under the blistering heat of the summer and in the freezing temperatures of the harsh mountain winter.  ""Sometimes in the winter the caves get flooded, and people have to dive in and swim to the end of the cave to bring a pump and get the water out,"" Nurbek, a local from a nearby town, says.  Accidents and deaths are common and people here are desperate for government help, but they are also reluctant to ask for it.  Nurjamal Mambetova, who has set up a local non-profit organisation and has been trying to come up with a solution to the problem, says she fears that drawing the government's attention to the issue could only make things worse.  ""We worry that they will close down the mines, or blow them up, and that won't solve the problem. People will just start going back to them and digging again because they have no other way to survive,"" she says.  ""What we need are alternatives, other jobs, or proper conditions at the mines. Something, just not this,"" Nurjamal says.  Over a cup of green tea, 35-year-old Zulfia weeps as she talks about her ordeal. She has five children and less than US$2 a day with which to feed them.  Her husband died in a mine accident, while trying to rescue two boys trapped inside. He only managed to save one and died with the other.  After the accident, the owner of the mine, another local resident, offered Zulfia's husband's job to their 10-year-old son.  ""Of course I won't let him do this, because I know what the price is, but other people do. We are just so desperate here,"" Zulfia says.  ""People are taking their children out of schools and sending them to work at mines, there is simply no other way to make money here.""  It takes a 40-minute hike, in blistering sun, to get to the mine where Zulfia's husband died.  When we arrive, two boys are loading heavy sacks onto donkeys; two others are heading inside the mine to bring out more. They do not even wear helmets.  Their hands are callused, and their childishly-chubby faces covered in black dust.  One of the boys, Uluk, tells us he is 14. He looks younger, but sounds older as he says he does not approve of his little brother working at a nearby mine.  ""It's very dangerous and it's not a proper place for children,"" Uluk says.  ""We hear about tragic cases all the time. There is gas inside the mines and you can get trapped and choke, or sometimes there is fire underneath,"" he says.  ""And it's very bad for your health. But still people have little choice. They come to make money, and so we come with them,"" he adds.  Uluk, like many children here, may not have much of a childhood, but he does have dreams.  ""When I grow up I want to become a policeman, so that I can catch thieves and protect children,"" he says.  It seems there is no one in Kyrgyzstan to protect him."
120,"The original 1972 inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, led by Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, was immediately dismissed as a ""whitewash"" by the relatives of the victims and the wider nationalist community. Thus began a long campaign for a fresh public inquiry into the events of that day.  Indeed, the official position of the British establishment quickly distanced itself from the conclusions drawn by Widgery. The following year, the Coroner, Hubert O'Neill, called the killings ""sheer, unadulterated murder"". Then, in 1974, the Ministry of Defence made 'goodwill' payments to the families of the victims, but without accepting responsibility for their deaths.  In 1992, then British Prime Minister John Major wrote to John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's nationalist SDLP and long-time Bloody Sunday campaigner, expressing the view that the British government had ""made clear in 1974 that those who were killed on 'Bloody Sunday' should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives.""  There had also been strong pressure from the Irish government, which published an assessment of new evidence relating to Bloody Sunday in June 1997.  It was against this political backdrop that British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced in January 1998 that the events of Bloody Sunday would at last be re-examined through a new, public and independent judicial inquiry.  The Bloody Sunday Inquiry, headed by Lord Saville of Newdigate, began on 3 April 1998. In his opening speech, Lord Saville said that his duty was to seek the truth and carry out that duty ""with fairness, thoroughness and impartiality"". Oral hearings commenced at Londonderry’s Guildhall on 27 March 2000 with an opening statement by Sir Christopher Clarke QC, Counsel to the Inquiry. It was the longest in British legal history, not concluding until June of that year.  Over four-and-a-half years, the inquiry heard testimony from nearly a thousand people - more than half of them civilians. Among the most dramatic was that of Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness. He confirmed in his statement to the inquiry that he was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry at the time of the Bloody Sunday shootings, the first time he had acknowledged his IRA membership. At the time, McGuinness was the serving education minister in the devolved Northern Irish government.  Giving evidence in November 2003, McGuinness denied a claim by the British agent 'Infliction' that he had fired the first shot on the day, describing the agent as ""a fantasist"". The inquiry nonetheless found that McGuinness was ""probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this.""  The inquiry also considered fresh evidence calling into question the leadership of the British Army in Northern Ireland. Classified papers drawn up three months before Bloody Sunday by the head of the British Army, General Michael Carver, raised the prospect of an operation to ""root out the terrorists"" in so-called 'no-go' areas of Derry.  A memo from General Robert Ford, the army commander in Northern Ireland, stated: ""I am coming to the conclusion that the minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ring leaders amongst the DYH (Derry Young Hooligans), after clear warnings have been issued.""  The Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry was delivered at the Guildhall in Derry on 15 June 2010.  Lord Saville concluded that ""firing by soldiers of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number, none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury. What happened on Bloody Sunday strengthened the Provisional IRA, increased nationalist resentment and hostility towards the Army and exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed. Bloody Sunday was a tragedy for the bereaved and the wounded, and a catastrophe for the people of Northern Ireland.""  The inquiry was estimated to have cost around £200 million. It sat for 444 days and took evidence from more than 900 witnesses. Following the report, British Prime Minister David Cameron made a statement to Parliament, saying that ""what happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable"".  For the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday, the Saville Inquiry had finally vindicated those who were killed and the report was hailed as a victory for their campaign."
121,"Student halls of residence, a library and teaching block are considered some of the most ""powerful and dramatic"" buildings to be found at universities built in the second half of the 20th Century, said heritage minister Andrew McIntosh.  He said the buildings, designed by architect Sir Denys Lasdun and built between 1964 and 1972, are of ""national significance"".  ""They illustrate how post-war British architecture can be innovative and elegant, but also practical in its approach to design and living,"" he said.  ""The best of post-war architecture deserves listing in the same way as their older counterparts.""  He said two distinctive ""Ziggurat"" or pyramidal-shaped accommodation blocks, known as the Norfolk and Suffolk Terraces and built between 1964 and 1968, are proposed for Grade II* listing.  The library, completed in 1972, and Teaching Wall, completed in 1970, are proposed for Grade II listing.  The views of local residents and interest groups will be considered before a decision is taken.  Sir Denys, who also designed the Royal National Theatre on London's South Bank, was once dubbed the ""grandfather of modernism"" as his designs were largely in concrete.  A principal theme was the idea of buildings as urban landscapes formed from interlocking spaces and levels.  The Grade II listing of post-war buildings was part of an initiative launched by the government in 1995."
122,"Police have searched a Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence.  No arrests have been made and Sir Cliff, 73, who is abroad, said the allegation was ""completely false"".  Police said the allegation involved a boy under 16.  The BBC understands it relates to an alleged sexual assault at a 1985 event where US preacher Billy Graham appeared at Bramall Lane, Sheffield.  The allegation is believed to have been reported to police recently.  The search in Sunningdale was carried out by South Yorkshire Police, which told the BBC it did not force entry to the property.  The investigation is not connected to Operation Yewtree and police said officers from that operation - set up by the Metropolitan Police to investigate hundreds of allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal - had been notified.  Thames Valley Police said it had assisted the South Yorkshire force with the execution of a search warrant at the property.  Eight plain-clothed police officers in five unmarked cars arrived to conduct the search which ended at about 15:30 BST.  In his statement, Sir Cliff Richard complained that the press appeared to have been given advance notice that his home in Berkshire was to be searched - whereas he hadn't been. He was referring to the reporters and camera crew from the BBC who were outside when police arrived.  It used to be common practice for police to let reporters know they were about to raid a celebrity's house or make a high-profile arrest.  It was part of the trade of information and favours between cops and hacks that has so recently fallen into disrepute. Procedures began to change in 2008 when the High Court considered the lawfulness of a search at the home of the football manager Harry Redknapp, who was being investigated for fraud.  The court described as ""understandable"" his complaint that journalists from the Sun had been present.  Two years ago, the Leveson Inquiry concluded that police operations involving the media should be ""controlled more tightly"" to avoid the ""perception of favouritism"" and the ""risk of violating the private rights of individuals"".  Since then, tip offs have dried to a trickle despite a series of high profile arrests. The media presence at Sir Cliff Richard's home, therefore, was highly unusual - it appears to be a deliberate attempt by police to ensure maximum coverage.  That's not illegal - but there are strict guidelines - and the force may have to justify its approach in the months to come.  Sir Cliff has responded to the police search of his apartment in a statement, which said: ""For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online.  ""The allegations are completely false. Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.  ""However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.  ""I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will cooperate fully should the police wish to speak to me. Beyond stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has concluded.""  Sir Cliff's spokesman said the singer would not be conducting interviews at this time.  According to the BBC's Tom Burridge in the Algarve, Portugal, the singer left his home there on Thursday morning and has travelled with his sister to another part of Portugal for a few days.  The singer, born Harry Webb, is one of the most successful British musicians of all time.  He has sold 21.5 million singles - more than any other male British artist - and is the only performer to have had at least one UK top five album in each of the last seven decades.  He has represented the UK in the Eurovision song contest twice and in 2013 released the 100th album of his career.  He was knighted in 1995 and performed at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace in 2012."

124,"Sophie, 42, gave birth by caesarean section at 1620 on Monday at the Frimley Park NHS hospital in Surrey.  The child, who weighed 6lbs 2oz (2.8kg), is eighth in the line to the throne. Prince Edward said he was ""very cute and very cuddly"".  The couple, who also have a four-year-old daughter Lady Louise Windsor, have not yet named the baby.  Sophie and her son are expected to stay in hospital for the next few days. The child is likely to take the title Viscount Severn.  Prince Edward was present at the birth and, speaking afterwards, said it had been ""a lot calmer than last time"" and that his wife was ""doing very well"".  He also said he was relieved, and added that his son was ""like most babies, rather small, very cute and very cuddly"".  When asked about a potential name he said: ""We didn't know, we had no idea what we were going to get, we hadn't asked.  ""You have to at least get to know the small person who's just come into the world before you actually try and pick a name.""  Sophie and Edward's daughter was born four weeks premature in 2003.  The countess had suffered a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy in 2001 before becoming pregnant with Lady Louise.  The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh and Sophie's father, Christopher Rhys Jones, have been informed and are also said to be ""delighted"" with the news.  Sophie Rhys-Jones married Prince Edward at St George's Chapel in Windsor in June 1999. They met at a tennis event in the summer of 1993."
125,"   Ask a little girl what her favourite colour is, and chances are she'll shout ""pink"". Toy aisles and clothing rails are packed with this shade, but is nothing but pink for girls harmful? How different it was in the early 1900s, when blue was for girls and pink for boys. Any colour so long as it's pink The Women's Journal explained it thus: ""That pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl."" DressMaker magazine agreed. ""The preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler, and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger (akin to red)."" What prompted the switch is unclear, but it had been made by the time Adolf Hitler ordered the classification of homosexuals. Those deemed ""curable"" were sent to concentration camps and labelled with a pink triangle. This suggests that by then, pink was associated with femininity. But some commentators now believe pink dominates the upbringing of little girls, and this may be damaging. Sue Palmer, author of Toxic Childhood, says the ""total obsession"" with pink stunts girls' personalities. ""I am very worried about it. You can't find girls over the age of three who aren't obsessed with the colour. It's under their skin from a very early age and severely limits choices, and decisions. The effect of pink is temporary - it is not the profound negative effect that is being argued    ""We have got to get something done about the effect marketeers are having. We are creating little fluffy pink princess, an image of girliness, that is very specific and which some girls don't want to go along with, but due to overwhelming peer pressure, are having to conform to."" So successful have toymakers been in creating a girl's world painted purely pink, that a study by speech therapists in Durham shows children having no problem identifying the colour blue, but saying ""Barbie"" when shown pink. But therapist and researcher Michael Gurian, who is based in the United States, says too much pink doesn't have a profound effect biologically - because it can't. Are girls now less likely to play rough? He says humans are programmed in a certain way and no amount of contact with external influences can change that. ""Everyone is hard-wired with four things - gender, a talent set, personality and differing ability to deal with trauma. ""I agree that if you are saying the environment has no effect on these, you go too far the other way, but the effect is negligible."" Mr Gurian, the author of Nurture The Nature, says the only thing that can profoundly change the way a girl is programmed to develop is a chemical imbalance or some kind of serious trauma. For example, he says images of thin models and actresses do not cause a person to become anorexic - there are more complicated factors at work. It is the same with over-exposure to pink (or any other single colour that might have been assigned to girls). ""Scientists all argue the same thing - you cannot have a biological organism without having an environment for it to exist in, but that environment does not change the very basic make-up of that organism. ""The effect is more temporary. It is not the profound negative effect that is being argued."" Enter any toy store or children's clothing department and it's easy to spot the gender divide - one side is floor-to-ceiling pink, the other camouflage shades with the odd dash of orange and blue. Hence discussion boards on parenting websites bemoan the fact it is ""impossible"" to buy any other colour for girls. My girls love pink - it's their favourite colour, but equally they are happy in the garden wallowing in mud    As girls are more aware of colour than boys - they put more colour in their drawings, for example, and learn colour names more quickly - it is no surprise that toy manufacturers have latched onto a certain shade to pitch at girls. ""It could've been any colour,"" says Mr Gurian. Boys too have their own stereotypes and colour palette to contend with, but feminists argue that these aren't as marginalising. Girls are already fighting inequality, they say. Mr Gurian says those who rail against pink think it means ""girl, girl, girl, which means not smart, which means oppressed"". But girls believed to have been harmed by too much pink are actually either ""traumatised by something, or not given the opportunities to develop their natural talents. That has nothing to do with pink."" Maria Dawes, a mother to two girls aged four and three, says: ""My girls love pink - it's their favourite colour, but equally they are happy in the garden wallowing in mud. Surely this is all just about balanced and sensible parenting? ""Exposure to all things pink does bother me a bit, but in the end, they will make their own decisions as they mature."" Mr Gurian himself has two teenage girls. ""My daughters love pink, but are very successful young women. Their love of pink and of girl stuff has not held them back."" Ms Palmer, too, has a daughter, and when she was little she played with a pastel-pretty My Little Pony. ""I tried hard for her not to have one, but she did. We were rock bottom broke though, so I couldn't give in to the pink pester power too much, thankfully."" Below is a selection of your comments. I agree the colour itself is not dangerous (I'm happily wearing bright pink at the moment), it's more a symptom of how society likes to box girls and women in, by expecting very specific things from them. I agree that stick-thin models don't cause anorexia, but they do cause feelings of inadequacy in a lot of girls and women (myself included).   Harriet R, Bristol, UK I always used to love pink as a child - I was given pink towels, pink fairy dresses and pink toy rabbits while my sister was given the same in blue. I was glad until about eight, when I wanted to grow out of it. Unfortunately my relatives disagreed and I used to die a little inside whenever I opened a present to find a bright pink pair of trousers or another pink fluffy animal. But I don't think I've been damaged by it, except I now loathe pink. I had to get my bedroom carpet changed because it was a particularly bright shade when I moved recently.   Anna, Beaconsfield, England When my daughter was little her favourite colours were pink and shiny. She had red hair and it clashed like crazy. But who cares? She was happy. Now she is grown and over the years her opinions have changed with her mood and occasionally with fashion. She is a strong, confident woman. What has pink got to do with that?   Alix The propensity of pink is not the only issue here as far as I am concerned. Whole aisles are dedicated to pink products, but blue is in scarce supply. My baby son looks really good in blue, however it is really difficult to get hold of blue clothes for him. In any shop you can get a huge amount of pink for girls, but for boys you generally have to go for neutral as there does not seem to be much blue. We wanted to get blue babygrows for him but despite a lot of searching we only got a couple, whereas if I had a girl and required pink I could have picked them up in all shops. More gender equality in baby clothes, please retailers.   Matt, Cheshire The shops only sell pink because that's what we buy based on the demands of little girls. I had no intention of dressing my daughter in pink, but that's all she wanted. I would offer her clothing in all sorts of lovely colours but she only wanted pink. And with each season's new offerings in the shops - usually with other new colours - she still wanted pink. It wasn't until she was 8 that she finally decided that pink was out.   Susan Hunt, Leidschendam, The Netherlands I don't see what the problem is. My daughter likes pink but she also likes all the other colours too. If a child is fixated on something it is not down to manufacturers or marketing, it is an in-built character trait. My daughter's room is pink, she has Barbies but most of her clothing is not pink and most of her toys and room accessories are not pink. Allow your children to be children. They will enter the adult world soon enough.   V Leese, Southampton, England I try desperately to avoid pink clothes for my 21-month-old daughter. But it's difficult to buy girls clothes in any other colour. I cringe when I walk through the ""girls"" section of toy shops because it turns completely pink. When I buy her toys I try to go for gender neutral ones. When I play with her it's with footballs or on my skateboard. But she loves pushing around a toy pram. A friend bought her a Barbie doll (to my horror), and she loved it. Sorry feminists, I tried, I really did.   Alan Holt, Malmesbury My 20 month old daughter is in purple today and my four year is in black and white. They have orange, red, blue, green, white and black clothes, oh and pink and I'm not loaded. There is a lot of pink but there are other colours too. Do not be pressured by your child to buy pink.   Nadine Norton, Shrewsbury My two year old niece seems oblivious to colour, especially when picking her clothes. Instead, the article of clothing is of more importance (shirt and pants v dress). However, whatever piece of clothing selected will invariably be put and worn on her head.    Leila, Canada I struggle to see how a girl's choice in clothing is limited. All the clothing stores I go to consist of four floors of girls clothes and two racks of boys clothes hidden at the back of the top floor.   Owen, London Kids change, thankfully. My daughter used to love the colour, had to have her room painted in a particularly nauseating hue, but now can't stand it. Her change kind of happened about the time she realised she didn't like Barbie anymore.    Iain, Dunfermline When I think about what I'm very worried about on behalf of children today, the consequences of continued and unchecked/uncheckable global human population growth comes more readily to mind. How we have arrived at a point where people can consider the over-representation of pink in little girls' wardrobes to be a crisis is baffling to me. For an intelligent species we have some tiny, tiny minds...   Steve, Winchester, UK I'm female and was born just after the end of WWII. I was often dressed in blue and my younger sister was often dressed in pink. Why? I have no idea, other than I was fair-haired and my sister had dark hair. Perhaps due to the austerities of the war, that was what was available at the time. Now I have the choice of which colours to wear, and I prefer reds and pinks, although I do wear blue as well. I don't think I have been harmed at all. Whatever next! Will someone suggest that we have too much green in nature?   Lesley, Sevenoaks I've always hated pink, it feels for me to have suggestions of fluffy, silly, girliness which doesn't suit my personality. My three-year-old daughter is very similar - her favourite colour is blue and she loves Thomas the Tank Engine, but I have no choice but to dress her in pink clothes, particularly on a restricted budget. Colour is an important expression of personality, and this is being restricted for girls. However, I don't think this ultimately affects their success or career choice, but I could be wrong.   Emma Carter, Bicester Sue Palmer claims that an obsession with Pink stunts a girls' personality. Surely, not allowing a child, whatever sex, the freedom to express their likes and dislikes re colour can only harm them more? I have two daughters (13 & 16) who have been in and out of love with the whole rainbow of colours and I'm happy to report that they are both extremely well-adjusted young ladies, with no personality problems at all.    Samm Dodge, Bishops Stortford, UK This pattern is in nature. When starlings are ready to find a mate, the base of their bill changes colour - males have a blue tinge and females have a pink tinge. Perhaps it's a natural choice? Just to confuse things... my favourite colour has always been aquamarine and I'm female.   Lesley, Hitchin My partner and I have a one-year-old daughter, who we attempt to dress in other colours. When she was born we received lots of clothes, unsurprisingly in pink. We reached our threshold when someone gave us a dozen different outfits for her first Christmas but all in the same sugar pink. After that we consciously dressed her in other colours, only to have people assume she was a boy even though she would be wearing a dress. The public in general assign pink to girls and some people appear to be confused if they do not see a girl baby dressed in that colour.   Marnie, Newport, South Wales Our eldest daugher, five, is all about pink, and has been for years. This is despite our conscious efforts to not force pinkness on her. Conversely our other daughter, three - who is surrounded by her sister's clothes etc - shows no particular interest in pink; she's more likely to go for yellow.   Andy, Brighton, UK Two of my friends have recently given birth to baby girls and whilst I don't have a problem with a bit of pink here and there, I do object to this ""Daddy's little princess"" culture that seems to go hand in hand with the colour. Combine this with the quite sexual nature of some clothes aimed at the under-10s, and the proliferation of Playboy merchandise that is also pink and fluffy, and you can end up with a dangerous message of objectification from an early age.   Laura, London Please! The pink issue is no different to girls just playing with dolls, boys being given cars and guns. Surely the idea is to provide a balance? Small children, given the right opportunities to become familiar with other colours, toys, experiences will have their own ideas as they grow up in society. For goodness sake be concerned about child cruelty and other serious issues for children. Pink obsessionism is rather frivolous.   Sue Sandham, Magor, Caldicot I'm sorry but girls liking pink is genetic. My niece loved the colour pretty much from birth and by no means had it been forced upon her. Little girls are girly, genetically, they are hard-wired to be so. End of story.   Sam Sam, colour preference is not hard-wired, what a silly thing to say, especially based on a sample size of one. I worry that children can't express themselves by wearing whatever colour they like. The large companies keep trying to pigeonhole everyone or ad agencies or even government agencies. We are individuals, adults and children and need to be treated as such.   Louise, Lincoln, UK I wish shops wouldn't always just do stuff in pink. My daughter won't wear ANYTHING pink or even with a bit of pink on it, hasn't in years. This makes buying most things VERY difficult especially as she's young. PLEASE more colours. I think this is her way of saying enough pink.   S Edwards, Bristol My beautiful baby daughter aged three months looks stunning in pink, despite the best efforts of me and my wife to avoid dressing her in the colour.   Christian Ball, London     "

127,"About 150 people voiced their anger at the landing of planes which they believe are carrying bombs for use in the conflict in Lebanon.  Two flights carrying ""hazardous"" material were diverted from Prestwick to the RAF Mildenhall military base in Suffolk on Saturday evening.  There has been no official confirmation of the cargo being carried.  A spokesman for the US air force at RAF Mildenhall said the two the Atlas Air cargo flights arrived late on Saturday night. One departed on Sunday afternoon, with the other expected to follow later.  He could not comment on what was on board the planes, but said they were there to refuel and allow the crew to rest.  Sunday's protest at Prestwick was organised by the Glasgow Stop the War Coalition.  Demonstrators unfurled banners, Lebanese flags and placards before chanting peace slogans and making a series of speeches.  The protest took place outside the main entrance after police ordered demonstrators to leave the terminal building.  The Strathclyde force said this had been for safety reasons, and described it as a ""very orderly protest"".  Glasgow-based human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar claimed that the UK Government was breaching international law by allowing bombs to pass through Prestwick.  He said: ""The munitions that have been allowed to land are weapons of mass destruction being used on innocent people.  ""The Americans have been landing munitions here for several months.""  Dr Rashid Mohammed, who speaks for Glasgow's 100-strong Lebanese community, said: ""Innocent people are getting killed by bombs of mass destruction which are coming through this airport.  ""We are calling for an immediate ceasefire and a stop to what's been going on at Prestwick.  ""What the Israelis are doing is not self-defence, it is the worst sort of war crime.""  Local Conservative MSP John Scott has joined the calls for future flights to be routed away from Prestwick.  ""If the Americans wish to support Israel's policy by providing these armaments they must do so from their own military airbases,"" he said.  ""They should not be doing so from Prestwick, which is Scotland's fastest-growing civilian airport.""  A spokesman for Prestwick said the airport had provided support for military flights - including refuelling aircraft and providing food and water - since World War I.  It was obliged to allow any Civil Aviation Authority-registered country to land its planes there but was not ""entitled or obliged"" to find out what cargo was being carried on flights in transit.  ""The operation of these reported flights is a matter between governments and discussions with regard to their operation takes place at a much higher level than us,"" the spokesman said.  Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said the Irish Government had refused to allow its airports to be used as a stopover for munitions.  ""Meanwhile, Scotland is dragged in as an unwilling accessory before the fact of violence and murder while our puppet executive of Labour and Lib Dem ministers maintains a guilt-ridden silence,"" he said.  ""This is an extraordinary situation, which is completely intolerable and totally unacceptable.""  The Scottish Green Party also congratulated Ireland for its stance.  It said First Minister Jack McConnell should ""pull out all the stops"" to persuade Westminster to say no to any more flights.  A spokesman for the Scottish Executive said it had no power over aviation policy, which was a matter for the Foreign Office."
128,"The BBC News Website examines the main issues behind the border conflict.  How did the border conflict begin?  The border between Ethiopia and Eritrea has been described as a geographer's nightmare.  From 1962 to 1993, Eritrea was ruled as a province of Ethiopia - and any argument over the borders was little more than a squabble between two local authorities.  So when Eritrea and Ethiopia separated amicably in 1993, no one paid too much attention to the details of the divorce settlement - least of all to a few hundred square kilometres of sparsely populated land in a region called Badme which included a small dusty town of the same name.  But when relations between the two neighbours deteriorated, Ethiopia accused Eritrea of invading a piece of land that was under Ethiopian administration.  The Eritreans replied that the land in question was rightfully theirs.  The result was a war fought on three fronts at the cost of tens of thousands of lives.  Who set up the boundary commission?  The commission was set up by the two countries as part of the Algiers peace settlement signed by both parties in 2000.  It followed a model that has been used in other cases around the world, where arbitration tribunals, instead of the International Court of Justice, have been used.  There were five lawyers - including two nominated by each country, who then nominated a president of the commission who has the casting vote.  So what were the Commission's terms of reference?  The commission was asked to interpret colonial treaties as the basis for the boundary.  This frontier was fixed in 1902 by a treaty between the Italian government, which had colonised Eritrea, and the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II - ruler of what was then one of the few independent African states.  The border is approximately 900 km long, and contains some of the driest, hottest and most hostile territory in the world. Part of it is defined by rivers.  Most of the border area under dispute is sparsely inhabited - barren land used as traditional grazing grounds by local people.  In terms of natural resources, the disputed area has virtually no value at all.  Both countries promised the UN that they would accept whatever decision was reached and there was no right of appeal.  What was the ruling and why was it not implemented?  Much of the commission's ruling in May 2002 was not contentious, but Ethiopia objected to the awarding of Badme to Eritrea - although the town was controversially not marked on Eritrea's map.  After seeking clarification and failing to get the commission to reverse its decision, Ethiopia insisted on talks before it would co-operate with the physical demarcation of the border.  Since then the UN has become increasingly frustrated at the cost of maintaining a peacekeeping force along the narrow buffer zone on the border.  Diplomatic attempts to get the two sides talking have faltered - primarily because Eritrea has refused to discuss the issue until Ethiopia accepts the ruling - something which until now Ethiopia has failed to do.  So what happens next?  Maintaining a state of hostility is not in the interests of either Ethiopia or Eritrea, and the closure of their border is deeply damaging to both sides.  In theory, Ethiopia Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's announcement in parliament that his government accepts the ruling ""in principle"" could enable talks to begin if Eritrea agrees.  It also permits diplomats to push ahead with efforts to resolve the Badme issue in a way which allows both sides to claim they have not lost.  One possibility is that Ethiopia could continue to administer Badme, while acknowledging Eritrean sovereignty over the area. It might even be possible, with a little goodwill, to agree to a joint administration of Badme.  The reality is, though, that the physical demarcation of the border placing Badme in Eritrea still looks a long way off - and remains a very bitter pill for Ethiopia to swallow.  The danger is that Eritrean frustration might provoke renewed conflict.  What is the role of the UN peacekeepers ?  Shortly after the peace deal in 2000, the UN Security Council set up Unmee and authorised a force of up to 4,200 military personnel to monitor the ceasefire and ensure the security aspects of peace deal are observed by both sides.  Expected to be there for a short period, UN troops are operating in some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world. They patrol an area some 25km wide and 900km long on the Eritrean side of the border with Ethiopia.  At present there are some 3,300 peacekeepers and military observers from some 40 countries, 191 civilians and 74 UN volunteers working for Unmee. Some 1,500 Indian troops provide the largest contingent in the force which is led by Major-General Rajender Singh.  But their continuing presence five years after a peace deal has become a costly headache for the UN. The bill is now $1bn and rising.  With recent restrictions imposed on their activities by Eritrea the UN forces are being left in an increasingly untenable position and with little prospect of border demarcation, the chances of the force being pulled out must be growing.  However, to leave now would be seen by critics as an expensive UN failure."
129,"A plaque dedicated to writer Mile Budak and a statue honouring Jure Francetic were removed in accordance with laws banning any homage to fascism.  Budak, a minister in the 1941 to 1945 Ustasha government, introduced race laws which led to the execution of thousands of Jews, Serbs and Gypsies.  The monuments were erected recently and some locals objected to their removal.  Following the Nazi invasion in 1941, a ""Greater Croatia"" was formed, also comprising most of Bosnia and western Serbia.  The fascist puppet government under Ante Pavelic acted brutally against Serbs and Jews as it sought to create a Catholic, all-Croat republic.  Francetic was a top military officer, and founder of the infamous Black Legion unit, which served in Bosnia.  The plaque to Budak in Sveti Rok, Lovinac, was put up last week by a group which said it was funded by people who fled the country to Australia and Canada in 1945.  It drew criticism from the government as well as rights groups and the Roman Catholic Church.  The government, which hopes to start European Union membership talks next year, decided to order the removal of the monuments during an emergency session on Thursday.  The cabinet also said it wanted amendments to the penal code to ban the promotion of all totalitarian ideologies, including communism and fascism.  Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the government would ""not allow Croatia to be imprisoned by the past - particularly by negative notions - but will direct all its capacities toward the future"".  ""The monuments are contrary to fundamental elements of the Croatian constitution and damage the reputation and interests of Croatia,"" he added.  Reuters news agency said several villagers in Sveti Rok cried as workers took away the black marble plaque to Budak.  The statue to Francetic, erected a few years ago in Slunj, was also torn down under heavy police security on Friday."
130,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""very alarmed"" after fresh allegations of suspected doping emerged in a leak of test data.  The Sunday Times and German broadcaster ARD/WDR have obtained access to the results of 12,000 blood tests from 5,000 athletes between 2001 and 2012.  According to the newspaper, the evidence - which has been seen by the BBC - reveals the ""extraordinary extent of cheating"" by athletes at the world's biggest events.  Wada's independent commission will investigate the claims in the ARD/WDR documentary Doping - Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics.  Wada president Sir Craig Reedie said his organisation was ""very disturbed by these new allegations... which will, once again, shake the foundation of clean athletes worldwide"".  The files belong to world governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), but have been leaked by a whistle-blower.  In a statement, the IAAF said the data had been obtained ""without consent"" and that it reserved the right to take any follow up action necessary.  The Sunday Times and ARD/WDR used two of the world's ""foremost anti-doping experts"", scientists Robin Parisotto and Michael Ashenden, to review the data.  According to the experts, the database reveals:  Parisotto said: ""Never have I seen such an alarmingly abnormal set of blood values. So many athletes appear to have doped with impunity, and it is damning that the IAAF appears to have idly sat by and let this happen.""  According to Ashenden, the files show that athletics is now in the same ""diabolical position"" as cycling during the Lance Armstrong era. He said it was ""a shameful betrayal of [the IAAF's] primary duty to police their sport and to protect clean athletes"".  The evidence is not proof of doping - but the revelations will raise more serious questions over whether the sport is doing enough to combat cheating ahead of the World Athletics Championships in Beijing later this month.  In its statement the IAAF, which the Sunday Times reported had on Friday dropped a planned injunction against publication of the story, added it was ""aware of serious allegations made against the integrity and competence of its anti-doping programme"".  It said the allegations ""are largely based on analysis of an IAAF database of private and confidential medical data which has been obtained without consent"".  ""The IAAF is now preparing a detailed response to both media outlets and will reserve the right to take any follow-up action necessary to protect the rights of the IAAF and its athletes.""  The federation is due to elect a new president in just over two weeks, with Britain's Lord Coe the favourite to win the election against IAAF vice-president Sergey Bubka. Coe has made independent testing a key part of his manifesto.  Former Olympic pole vault champion Bubka told the BBC: ""We will not stop the fight. We know that in the 21st century doping is the biggest danger and there will be zero tolerance. If we need to strengthen our rules and regulations we will do it.""  The IAAF said that before the introduction in 2009 of the biological passport - which monitors longitudinal blood values - its testers had ""systematically pursued"" all results that were deemed ""atypical"" with immediate urine tests for EPO and then target-tested those athletes in and out of competition.  Since the introduction of the passport, the IAAF says it has ""pursued more cases under the passport system than all other anti-doping organisations together"", and is spending $2m a year on combating cheating. ""As a percentage of overall annual budget this is the highest of any sport,"" it added.  There can be various reasons for abnormal blood samples other than performance-enhancing drugs. Illness, altitude training and pregnancy can all influence values.  The latest claims come after a turbulent few months for athletics.  In December, ARD/WDR alleged systematic doping in Russian athletics and implicated the IAAF in covering up the problem. The Russian Athletics Federation called the allegations lies, and IAAF president Lamine Diack denied any collusion, although he did admit to the BBC that his sport was ""in crisis"". Both the IAAF and Wada are investigating the allegations.  The German documentary-makers also claimed an unnamed member of the IAAF medical commission had a list of 150 suspicious blood samples from 2001 to 2008 that were not investigated. Diack described this as ""ridiculous"".  The IAAF insisted that the whistle-blower would not have known if follow-up tests had been conducted and pointed out that its athlete biological passport scheme was only launched in 2009 and samples before that date did ""not have the same level of reliability and strength as the post-2009 values which were collected under strict and stringent conditions"".  In June, the BBC's Panorama programme alleged that Mo Farah's coach Alberto Salazar violated various anti-doping rules with other athletes. He denies the allegations, and there is no suggestion that double Olympic champion Farah was guilty of any wrongdoing. UK Anti-Doping and the US Anti-Doping Agency are investigating the claims.  Although it was one of the first sports to introduce the biological passport, athletics has a chequered history of drug scandals, from East Germany's years of state-sponsored doping through to the Balco affair in 2002.  These latest claims could lead to renewed calls for countries to be banned from international competition, and there will be more scrutiny of powerhouse athletics nations like Russia and Kenya. In January, marathon champion Rita Jeptoo became the 45th Kenyan to fail a doping test, while 25 Russian walkers have been suspended for doping offences in the past six years.  London 2012's reputation as the cleanest Games in 50 years will also be questioned, as the sport struggles to assert its credibility and reputation."
131,"The death toll from violence in the southern Kyrgyz city of Osh has risen to at least 45, amid fresh fighting.  The clashes between Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbek groups flared late on Thursday - the worst violence in the Central Asian country since ex-President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was overthrown in April.  Dozens of buildings were on fire as fighting spread on Friday. About 600 people have been hurt, officials say.  The interim government has declared a state of emergency and deployed troops.  The situation in southern Kyrgyzstan remains tense. Some buildings in the centre of the city are still on fire. Osh consists of Kyrgyz and Uzbek neighbourhoods. Roadblocks have been installed at the entrance to each residential area. About 100 people, mainly women and children, are stuck at Osh airport, which is being guarded by armed policemen. It appears that many Osh residents, both Kyrgyz and Uzbek, are armed. The interim government of Kyrgyzstan says that the violence in the south was co-ordinated. But it is not clear who was behind it. Some reports suggest that the violence could have been organised by the supporters of Kyrgyzstan's ousted President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who was overthrown in a mass uprising in April.  Osh is home to a large ethnic Uzbek community and was the power base of former President Bakiyev.  The cause of the latest fighting is unclear. According to local reports, the violence broke out between rival gangs and developed into gun battles late on Thursday.  Homes, shops and restaurants were attacked. Cars and a theatre were set alight.  After a night of violence followed by a lull, the shooting continued with renewed force on Friday.  Interim President Roza Otunbayeva said: ""We're clearly talking about a stand-off between two ethnicities. We need (to muster) forces and means to stop and calm these people down, and this is what we are doing right now.""  Soldiers have been posted at routes into the city and at major intersections. A curfew is in force, but violence continued into Friday night in central Osh.  Most of the properties attacked appear to belong to ethnic Uzbeks.  The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie in Osh says she drove through ethnic Uzbek districts where residents had written SOS on their homes.  In another Uzbek neighbourhood, houses were on fire and people were building barricades, the Reuters news agency reported on Friday.  Residents told the BBC they were hoping that Uzbek troops from across the border would come to help if their neighbourhoods were attacked overnight.  They have also said that all their women and children are at the Uzbek border nearby.  The interim government, which came to power after Mr Bakiyev's removal, has been struggling to impose order in the city ever since.  The leaders of Russia and China have appealed for calm.  The political crisis has raised fears of a civil war in the country, where both Russia and the US have military bases.  Our correspondent says Kyrgyzstan a strategically important country that borders China in the east.  The American base near the capital Bishkek is used for US operations in Afghanistan.  Mr Bakiyev fled with his family to Belarus after violent clashes between government forces and protesters on 7 April.  The interim government has promised to hold elections in October, after a constitutional referendum on reducing presidential powers."
132,"The Ivory Coast has rejected allegations that child slavery is widespread on cocoa farms as ""nonsense"" and ""wildly inaccurate"".  The documentary shown on British television station Channel 4 on Thursday made unsubstantiated allegations damaging the Ivory Coast, said Kouadio Adjoumani, the country's ambassador to the UK.  ""The absurdity of the claim that 90% of farms use slave labour is shown up by the simple fact that this would mean that nearly every one of the 700,000 farmers employs slaves, patently nonsense as anyone with any knowledge of our country would know.""  Cocoa producers and international cocoa traders have also criticised the documentary as exaggerating.  Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa - the main ingredient in chocolate.  Ivorian and Malian authorities admit there is a problem, and signed an agreement recently to halt trafficking of child labour.  Mali's government is seeking to raise money to repatriate, rehabilitate and resettle what they estimate to be 15,000 Malian children working without payment on Ivorian cocoa plantations. British chocolate makers have said they plan to investigate the Channel 4 report and insist upon action if such ""abhorrent practices"" were discovered. ""We do not believe that the farms visited by the programme are in the least representative of cocoa farming in Cote d'Ivoire, although the claims cannot be ignored,"" the Biscuit, Cake Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance (BCCCA) said in a statement. Cocoa prices are at a 10 year low, and farmers have burnt small amounts of crop last year to try to boost the prices. The cocoa market has also been deregulated which is making it diffiicult for farmers to get their money. Less scrupulous ones have stopped paying their workers altogether."
133,"There has been a rise in GP prescriptions for alcohol dependency Hospital admissions linked to alcohol use have more than doubled in England since 1995, an NHS report shows. Alcohol was the main or secondary cause of 207,800 NHS admissions in 2006/7, compared to 93,500 in 1995/96. There has also been a 20% rise in the number of GP prescriptions for treating alcohol dependency in the past four years, the NHS Information Centre said. The British Liver Trust warned that the health impact of alcohol would only get worse in years to come. Tim Straughan, chief executive of the NHS Information Centre, agreed that alcohol was placing an ever-increasing burden on the NHS. We are talking about a younger age group, drinking sometimes huge quantities, which can be damaging    ""These rises paint a worrying picture about the relationship between the population and the bottle,"" he added. The figures include hospital admissions for a specific alcohol-related condition - such as liver disease, but also admissions where alcohol is a contributory factor but not the main cause - such as falls due to drunkenness. Of hospital admissions in 2006/7 specifically due to an alcohol-related diagnosis, almost one in 10 were in under 18 year olds. In 2006 there were 6,500 deaths related to alcohol, of which two thirds were men - a 19% rise from 2001 figures. The north west had the highest rate of alcohol-related admissions at 170 per 100,000, while the lowest was the east of England which had 72 per 100,000. Survey results also contained in the report showed more pupils aged 11 to 15 years who say they have never had an alcoholic drink increased from 39% in 2001 to 45% in 2006. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. But those who admit to drinking are drinking more - consuming 11.4 units per week on average, the highest figure ever recorded by the survey. And 30% of 15 year olds said it was fine to get drunk at least once a week, the poll of over 8,000 teens found. Among adults in 2006, 72% of men and 57% of women reported drinking an alcoholic drink on at least one day in the previous week. And 12% of men and 7% of women reported drinking on every day in the previous week. Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader According to the NHS Information Centre alcohol was 69% more affordable in 2007 than in 1980. Dr Varuna Aluvihare, a liver specialist at Kings College Hospital said: ""We are talking about a younger age group, drinking sometimes huge quantities, which can be damaging. ""We are seeing people in their 20s and 30s. When I started practising, we saw people in their 50s."" Frank Soodeen, spokesperson for Alcohol Concern said the figures confirmed what they had heard from frontline NHS staff. ""The government needs to shape a response that meets the challenges thrown up by this bulletin. ""Information campaigns are a great first step, but we also need urgent investment in treatment systems that help steer problem drinkers away from harmful behaviour before they develop chronic conditions."" Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said the government was working harder than ever to reduce alcohol-related hospital admissions. ""The NHS spends £217m a year on specialist alcohol treatment and I have just launched a £6m campaign to make sure people know their units and know how much they're drinking."" Alison Rogers, chief executive of the British Liver Trusts said: ""This is set to hit England hard over the following years because liver disease can take up to 10 years to develop. ""We need action now to protect people's health to stop health harm from alcohol spiralling out of control.""     "
134,"The final word on what really happened on 30 January 1972 - Bloody Sunday - will wait until the long-awaited report on the Saville inquiry is published. But ever since the day when British soldiers opened fire on protesters in Londonderry, killing 14, there have been claims that the Army deliberately misled those investigating the tragedy. These have continued despite firm denials of any attempt to deceive by a senior army officer at the Bloody Sunday inquiry. Yet, as Radio 4's Document programme reports, there have long been claims that elements in the Army and British government were behind a widespread propaganda campaign throughout the early 1970s - mostly aimed at undermining the IRA. Stories they are alleged to have spun to the press ranged from falsely linking the Provisionals to a deadly loyalist pub bombing to others involving Soviet submarines, black magic, Czech snipers and even exploding women's underwear. The introduction of internment in Northern Ireland in August 1971 in response to growing violence from the IRA had backfired. The violence got even worse and British forces found themselves losing the battle for public opinion. Concerned that the IRA was using the policy to further its propaganda war, London decided to fight back. It set up what was known as the Information Policy Unit, or IPU, at the Army's headquarters in Lisburn. Its job was to discredit the IRA wherever possible, often by holding special briefings with journalists. The Provisional IRA launched a series of horrifying bomb attacks in Belfast This was joined soon after by another group, the Information Research Department or IRD, a behind-the-scenes branch of the Foreign Office created in 1948 to counter communism. Both groups were now to engage in a full-blown propaganda war against the IRA and some other paramilitaries. In December 1971, a month before Bloody Sunday, an explosion ripped apart McGurk's Bar, a Catholic pub in Belfast - killing 15 people and wounding 17 more. The Army and police claimed to have found evidence that the bomb that caused the blast had gone off inside the bar. Given that McGurk's was a Catholic bar, this implied that it must have been an IRA device that went off accidentally. Forensic evidence later proved that the bomb had clearly been placed outside the pub. Finally, seven years later, the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force was convicted of the attack. Claims made by the Army directly following the events on Bloody Sunday fuelled suspicions of attempts to mislead investigators here at the BBC. Appearing on Radio 4's Today programme on 31 January 1972, army spokesman Col Maurice Tugwell insisted there was evidence that some of those who died were far from innocent bystanders. ""One of the dead men was found in a car that had been taken out of the town and he had four nail-bombs in his pockets, and of the others who are dead in the hospital preliminary investigations show that four of them at least are on the wanted list,"" Col Tugwell said. Relatives of the Bloody Sunday victims have campaigned for the truth He later admitted to the Bloody Sunday inquiry that some of what he had said contained ""mistakes"" and ""errors"". But this, he claimed, was the result of inaccurate information he had received at the time - and not down to any deliberate attempt to deceive. However, critics have pointed to the fact that he was a leading figure in the propaganda war being waged from the army's Lisburn headquarters. In August 1972, Prime Minister Edward Health gave his backing to the covert war. A letter written by Principal Private Secretary Robert Armstrong to the Home Office stated: ""The discrediting of the IRA will require the immediate injection of a considerable number of additional staff. The prime minister would like to see the place flooded with them, taken from Whitehall, the Central Office of Information or wherever available; and above all we should get hold of those who are experienced in psychological warfare and give them their head."" We used to collect chicken blood from the cook house at the army barracks and put that on the altars so it looked like there had been a sacrifice    From this point on, Britain's propaganda war entered a new phase. Stories spun to journalists became ever more outlandish and even comical. Take the following story which appeared in the News of the World that same year, headlined: ""Russia in IRA plot sensation."" It read: ""Intelligence agents have discovered that the Russian Government is directly involved in the supply of rocket launchers and other arms to the IRA. ""A sinister dossier of evidence includes: MYSTERY landings by men in Eire from a submarine; SIGHTING of a Soviet tanker and submarine close to the coast in suspicious circumstances; An OCTOBER visit to Dublin by a notorious Kremlin agent; ACTIVITIES of a one-eyed American in the city."" A man in the thick of it all was Colin Wallace, an IPU army press officer based at the Lisburn HQ, who admits to having spun - if not entirely created - many of the stories passed to journalists. A highly controversial figure, he remembers spreading ""news"" that both IRA and loyalist paramilitaries had become involved in witchcraft and black magic. He even went as far as planting ""black altars"" in certain areas and going to great lengths to get the ""props"" that went with them. ""We used to collect chicken blood from the cook house at the army barracks and put that on the altars so it looked like there had been a sacrifice or something,"" he says. ""It was made to look really horrible."" The IRA didn't take all this lying down - and came up with its own spin on events. But Sinn Fein's former director of publicity Danny Morrison says some stories were so ridiculous they thought few would believe them anyway. He claims to remember one in particular ""that the IRA had hired in a thousand-pounds-per-shot Czechoslovakian sniper"". Mr Morrison recalls: ""And the way he worked was that if a young soldier was walking through Ballymurphy, a Catholic young woman would open her curtains and bare her breasts. ""The soldier's attention would be distracted and the Czechoslovakian sniper would shoot him dead."" Other propaganda stories passed to the press by Wallace and Tugwell's office included claims that making explosives could give you cancer and that devices hidden in women's clothing might be ignited by friction from their underwear. But in the end it all spun out of control. IRD staff were removed from Northern Ireland in 1973 and their IPU colleagues soon after that. The aim of the exercise had been to defeat terrorism and save lives. Some now argue that all the spinning and lying may actually have had the opposite effect by making it harder than ever for both sides to understand each other.

135,"US singer Stevie Wonder has collected one of France's top cultural honours in Paris, 30 years after he was first named to receive it.  The 59-year-old Motown star was made a Commander of the Arts and Letters by French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand.  Wonder was named a Commander in 1981, but officials said scheduling conflicts had delayed his formal decoration.  ""I receive this honour in memory of my mother and in memory of all of those that have made it possible for me to stand here today,"" Wonder said.  The singer was also in Paris to perform and collect a lifetime achievement prize at France's biggest musical awards show on Saturday.  ""All this in one day, it's almost too much for me. I'm breathless,"" he added.  Mr Mitterrand told Wonder: ""As citizen, administrator and culture minister I just called to say we love you.""  Previous recipients of the honour include actors Roger Moore and Dennis Hopper and punk singer Patti Smith.  The Order of Arts and Letters was established in the 1950s to recognise those who have contributed significantly to the arts in France and throughout the world."
136,"Few were expecting such an announcement about the demise of Hubble.  Just a few weeks ago Steven Beckwith, the director of Hubble's home institution, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland, told BBC News Online that he was looking forward to the next servicing mission and the upgrade Hubble would receive.  Mr Beckwith said that Hubble was working more efficiently than when it was new and could get even better.  With Hubble's replacement - the James Webb Telescope - not due in orbit until 2012 at the earliest, he hoped that Hubble could survive until the handover.  So what happened? Why is the US space agency (Nasa) abandoning one of the most productive scientific instruments of all time?  The main reason is safety. It is said that the decision was made solely by Nasa's chief, Sean O'Keefe, and that it was not related to President George Bush's new space plan for a return to the Moon and missions to Mars. Money was not an issue.  This is so that the shuttle crew have a lifeboat in space if there are any problems.  But Hubble is not in an orbit from which it is possible to get to the ISS. New safety and inspection procedures would have had to be developed just for this one mission and it was deemed unfeasible.  Hubble's next servicing mission was due in 2005. During the flight, two major instruments - the Wide Field Camera 3 and the Cosmic Origins Spectrometer - would have been installed.  They would have been magnificent additions to Hubble, significantly boosting its performance.  Now they are not going the scientists concerned will be devastated and will want to explore other ways to get the instruments into space. Even if they are successful in flying them, it will be on a smaller mission and they will not benefit from Hubble's extraordinary ability to intercept light from the cosmos.  Although abandoning Hubble solves one problem it raises another - a big one.  Left alone, Hubble will fall back to Earth sometime in 2012 and it is big enough not to burn up completely.  ""Its main mirror, and its titanium support ring, will survive and reach the ground,"" Steven Beckwith told BBC News Online.  One estimate says there is a one in 700 chance of human casualties resulting from an uncontrolled Hubble re-entry. That is, everyone agrees, unacceptable.  The plan was that on a follow-on shuttle visit a propulsion module would be attached to Hubble to bring it down in a predictable way, on to an uninhabited region of the Earth. Clearly that plan cannot now happen.  The de-orbit module will still have to be fitted, only by an automatic docking, and currently Nasa does not have the technology to do this. Russia does. So perhaps it may be asked to help out.  But whatever happens Hubble's end will be tricky and expensive. Doing nothing is not an option.  Although some of Hubble's scientists are reported to be preparing job applications at other institutes, there is still a lot of science Hubble can do. But with the announcement that it will not be re-serviced, most of its science is now behind it and it could cease working altogether at any time.  Hubble has six gyroscopes which control its pointing. Only four are working. In normal circumstances it requires three for normal operations (though some science can be done with two). If any more fail, as they are bound to do eventually, that could spell the end its life.  If all goes well, Hubble will continue exploring and will still have a few surprises for us. Abandoned it may have been, but it has not finished yet."
137,"Former international goalkeeper Harry Gregg, 75, will never forget that day 50 years ago when so many of his friends, among them the Busby Babes, died on a snow laden runway.  But he might draw some comfort from the thought of those he pulled from the wreckage.  At 1503 GMT on 6 February 1958, the plane carrying the legendary footballers back from Belgrade crashed in a blizzard after re-fuelling at Munich airport.  Gregg found himself hailed as a hero after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors - the goalkeeper's ""greatest ever save"".  Among those he helped was Vera Lukic, the wife of a Yugoslavian diplomat and her daughter, Vesna.  What he did not know was that Vera was pregnant. And in saving her, he also saved her son, Zoran.  Late last year, he returned to Belgrade and met the man who was not even born when Gregg saved his life.  He sat with Vera Lukic and her family and talked about that day and what it meant to all of them.  Zoran told Gregg: ""I have always wanted this moment, to look into your face and say to you, 'thank you'. I was the third passenger you saved, but, at the time, you were not to know that.""  Gregg replied: ""You've nothing to thank me for. I did what had to be done without thinking about it.  ""I've lived with being called a hero but I'm not really a hero. Heroes are people who do brave things knowing the consequences of their actions. That day, I had no idea what I was doing.""  On the anniversary of the crash, what he would like to remember, he said, are the happy moments before the crash changed everything.  ""The fact there's going to be a minute's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people I played with, but one must remember as well, there were other people on board that aircraft, a lot more people.  ""I want the minute's silence to be over and then I want to remember the happy times, that's what I want the world to remember, that's what I want the families to remember.  ""I want to remember fighting for the best tracksuits on the training ground, fighting for the best pair of socks. I want to remember the Arsenal game (united beat Arsenal 5-4 at Highbury in their last game in England before the crash).  ""And I want to remember the happy, free spirits after the final game (against Red Star Belgrade) and the banquet that night.""  Back in his home on the north coast of Ireland, Harry Gregg has pictures on his wall of the crash scene.  Yet they make up only part of what is a vast gallery of shots from his days as a Manchester United player.  And the most prominent pictures on that wall capture a young team, flush with promise, before a glittering future was cruelly snatched away.  ""I don't want my life to remembered for what happened on a runway,"" he said.  ""I don't need the sheriff's badge and I don't want to play the hero.""  He added: ""The wonderful thing to me about that period of time was the freshness of youth and the free spirit, the manner in which we played.  ""I'm not a poet but I always think 'they laughed, they loved, they played the game together, they played the game and gave it every ounce of life and the crowds - they thronged to see such free, young spirits'.  ""To me that what's I want to remember, that was the wonderful thing.""  Re-United is on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday, February 4 at 10.35pm."
138,"He was speaking after military commanders were said to be worried that the prince might draw enemy fire and put other troops at risk.  Mr Reid, speaking in Afghanistan, said Harry should be allowed to carry out normal duties ""as far as is possible"".  The prince's unit, the Household Cavalry's Blues and Royals, is due to be sent to Iraq next year.  Prince Harry is adamant that, if his soldiers go, he wants to be there too.  Speaking last year, he said: ""If they said 'no, you can't go front line' then I wouldn't drag my sorry ass through Sandhurst and I wouldn't be where I am now.  ""The last thing I want to do is have my soldiers away to Iraq or wherever like that and for me to be held back home.""  But it is understood some military commanders feel a royal presence in this already volatile region could increase the dangers for British troops.  Mr Reid said the prince's profile must be taken into account but that he should be allowed to carry out his duties.  ""It would be my wish to do that as far as is possible, but obviously if there are aspects because of his prominence, that he has not sought, that would lead to a threat dimension that would be taken into account by commanding officers,"" he said.  ""That is for them to judge but my plea would be to let this young man... be treated as what he is and that's a potentially very good young officer.""  A Clarence House spokesman also admitted that, in some circumstances, Prince Harry's presence could pose an increased risk to his regiment but said a ""judgement call"" would have to be made by his commanding officer.  Defence analyst Amyas Godfrey, of the Royal United Services Institute, said he thought the dangers of the prince serving in a battle zone had been overstated.  ""It would be an enormous amount of resources to kidnap one British soldier or to specifically attack that one specific soldier, and in many ways that would be counter-productive for an insurgency,"" he said."

140,"Police spokesman Yatim Suyatmo said this appeared to be the final figure, as there will no longer be an official team on the island working on victim identification.  The announcement came as police presented evidence against the alleged mastermind behind the Bali bombings, Imam Samudra.  The 1,500 page dossier on Mr Samudra - together with evidence on four of his alleged accomplices - was handed over to prosecutors on Wednesday.  Under Indonesian law, prosecutors decide if there is strong enough evidence to take a case to court.  The number of people who died in the 12 October attacks had previously been put at 194.  But Bali police spokesman Yatim Suyatmo said an additional eight people had died in hospitals overseas as a result of their injuries.  Hundreds of body parts have also been collected, and are due to be buried on the island at a future date.  The two bombs, which ripped through a busy nightclub area in the island's popular Kuta district, killed mostly foreign tourists.  Australia suffered the greatest number of casualties, with 88 Australian nationals losing their lives.  Thirty-eight Indonesians, 26 Britons, nine Swedes, seven Americans, six Germans and four Dutch nationals also lost their lives.  In all, citizens from 21 countries were killed in the blasts.  Imam Samudra, 35, will be charged with organising and planning the Bali attacks, Mr Suyatmo said.  ""This is a big step forward for the police,"" he said. ""We want to finish a thorough investigation of those arrested in connection with the Bali bombings.""  Imam Samudra was arrested on 21 November, while about to flee from Indonesia's main island of Java.  Police say he has already confessed to his part in the Bali attack, as well as involvement in a bombing in Batam on Christmas Eve 2000.  Under recently passed anti-terror regulations, he faces the death penalty if found guilty.  Of the four other suspects whose cases were filed on Wednesday, two could face the death penalty, according to Mr Suyatmo.  On Monday, police presented prosecutors with evidence against another key suspect, Ali Gufron, also known as Mukhlas.  Last week they presented evidence against his brother, Amrozi, whom they accuse of buying the minivan and explosives used in the attack.  So far, 29 people have been arrested in connection with the bombings. The first trials are expected to begin next month.  Imam Samudra is one of three suspects accused of being part of Jemaah Islamiah, a pan-Asian network of Muslim extremists which some governments have accused of plotting the attacks."
141,"UK doctors are being told the antibiotic normally used to treat gonorrhoea is no longer effective because the sexually transmitted disease is now largely resistant to it.  The Health Protection Agency says we may be heading to a point when the disease is incurable unless new treatments can be found.  For now, doctors must stop using the usual treatment cefixime and instead use two more powerful antibiotics.  One is a pill and the other a jab.  The HPA say the change is necessary because of increasing resistance.  Tests on samples taken from patients and grown in the laboratory showed reduced susceptibility to the usual antibiotic cefixime in nearly 20% of cases in 2010, compared with just 10% of cases in 2009.  As recently as 2005, no gonorrhoea bacteria with reduced susceptibility to cefixime could be found in the UK.  The bacterium that causes the infection - Neisseria gonorrhoeae - has an unusual ability to adapt itself and has gained resistance, or reduced susceptibility, to a growing list of antibiotics - first penicillin itself, then tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin and now cefixime.  The World Health Organization recommends that the first-line antibiotic used is changed when treatment failure in patients reaches 5%.  But for cefixime, the change is being made pre-emptively, owing to the alarming rise in resistance that is emerging.  Prof Cathy Ison, a gonorrhoea expert at England's HPA, said: ""Our lab tests have shown a dramatic reduction in the sensitivity of the drug we were using as the main treatment for gonorrhoea. This presents the very real threat of untreatable gonorrhoea in the future.  ""We were so worried by the results we were seeing that we recommended that guidelines on the treatment of gonorrhoea were revised in May this year, to recommend a more effective drug.  ""But this won't solve the problem, as history tells us that resistance to this therapy will develop too. In the absence of any new alternative treatments for when this happens, we will face a situation where gonorrhoea cannot be cured.""  She said patients who refuse the jab will be offered oral antibiotics instead.  She added: ""This highlights the importance of practising safe sex, as, if new antibiotic treatments can't be found, this will be only way of controlling this infection in the future.""  After genital chlamydia, gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the UK.  According to HPA figures, there were 16,145 new diagnoses of gonorrhoea in 2010, a 3% increase on 2009 when there were 15,606."
142,"The legislation was passed by the parliament's upper house, having cleared the lower house last month.  The move marks a victory for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has made revising the constitution one of his top priorities, correspondents say.  The current constitution has not been changed since 1947.  Drawn up by the US occupation authorities after WWII, it bans military force in settling international disputes and prohibits maintaining a military for warfare.  But Mr Abe wants Japan to be more assertive on the world stage, with a military able to take part in peacekeeping missions abroad.  Mr Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is working on a draft of a new constitution.  The legislation passed by parliament says that a referendum on the issue cannot take place before 2010, and needs approval from a majority of voters.  ""Since this will take effect in three years, what is important is to deepen the debate among the people even further,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said.  Public opinion in Japan on the issue also appears to be mixed, with many in favour of some changes to the constitution while wanting the country to remain officially pacifist.  Four opposition groups - including the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) - opposed the bill because of divided public sentiment on the issue, Japan's Kyodo news agency said.  Critics of the proposed changes say the pacifist constitution has kept Japan out of war since the 1940s and allowed the country to focus on economic growth instead.  The move may also meet concern from South Korea and China, which remain suspicious of Japan because of its wartime aggressions.  Japan's constitution has been stretched in recent years to allow the country to have a self-defence force.  Under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, this was pushed still further, to allow troops to join peacekeeping missions in Iraq."
143,"Fidel Castro, who has announced he is stepping down as Cuba's president, has run the country for so long that nearly three-quarters of its people have known no other leader.  Although the US has tried hard to get rid of him, President Castro outlasted no fewer than nine American presidents since he took power in 1959.  In July 2006 President Castro underwent emergency intestinal surgery and has not attended any public events since.  Though officials say their leader is recuperating, his prolonged absence has raised questions about his health.  On 19 February 2008 he announced: ""I neither will aspire to nor will I accept, the position of president of the council of state and commander in chief.""  He had hinted as much on 17 December, in a letter read out on Cuban television in which he said he had a duty not to cling on to power or stand in the way of a younger generation.  While his (also elderly) brother Raul has been acting president since last year, the reference to younger leaders suggests Raul may not automatically succeed him.  The question that remains is whether Cuba's Communist Revolution will outlast Fidel Castro.  The Communist leader - known for his long-winded anti-American rhetoric - was born Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz in 1926 to a wealthy, landowning family.  He received a Jesuit education, and graduated from Havana University as a lawyer.  But, shocked by the contrast between his own comfortable lifestyle and the dire poverty of so many others, he became a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary.  In 1953, he took up arms against the regime of President Fulgencio Batista.  Aiming to spark a popular revolt, on 26 July Mr Castro led more than 100 followers in a failed attack on the Moncada military barracks in Santiago de Cuba.  Fidel Castro and his brother Raul survived, but were imprisoned.  Amnestied after two years, Mr Castro continued to campaign against the Batista regime while in exile in Mexico, and established a guerrilla force known as the 26 July Movement.  His revolutionary ideals attracted support in Cuba and in 1959 his forces overthrew Batista, whose regime had become a byword for corruption, decadence and inequality.  Cuba's new rulers - who included the legendary Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara - promised to give the land back to the people and to defend the rights of the poor.  Fidel Castro insisted his ideology was, first and foremost, Cuban. ""There is not Communism or Marxism, but representative democracy and social justice in a well-planned economy,"" he said at the time.  In April 1961, the US attempted to topple the Castro government by recruiting a private army of Cuban exiles to invade the island.  At the Bay of Pigs, Cuban troops repulsed the invaders, killing many and capturing 1,000.  A year later, US reconnaissance planes discovered Soviet missiles on their way to sites in Cuba. The world was suddenly confronted with the possibility of all-out nuclear war.  The superpowers stood eyeball to eyeball, but it was the Soviet leader who gave way, pulling his missiles out of Cuba in return for a secret withdrawal of US weapons from Turkey.  Fidel Castro, though, had become America's enemy number one.  The CIA tried to assassinate him - more than 600 times, according to one Cuban minister.  Getting him to smoke a cigar packed with explosives was one idea.  Other anti-Castro plots were even more bizarre, including one to make his beard fall out and ridicule him.  Despite his reliance on Russian help, President Castro put Cuba at the head of the newly emerging Non-Aligned Movement.  Yet, in Africa especially, he took sides, sending his troops in to support Marxist guerrillas in Angola and Mozambique in the 1970s.  But the 1980s era of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev proved catastrophic for President Castro's revolution.  Moscow in effect pulled the plug on the Cuban economy by refusing to take its sugar any more.  Still under American blockade and with its Soviet lifeline cut off, chronic shortages and empty shelves in Cuba were inevitable. Tempers grew shorter as the food queues grew longer.  By the mid-1990s, many Cubans had had enough. Thousands took to the sea in a waterborne exodus to Florida. Many drowned.  It was a crushing vote of no-confidence in their leader.  Even his own daughter Alina Fernandez prefers a life of exile as a dissident in Miami to rule under her ""despotic"" father.  President Castro has used US hostility as a reason to reject democratic reforms to his one-party state.  But Cuba under his rule has made impressive domestic strides.  Fidel Castro retains his ability to rattle and irritate the US, lately engaging in a diplomatic tussle with the US Interests Section over a propaganda display outside the building.  He has also engineered a rapprochement with oil-rich Venezuela, run by his great friend, Hugo Chavez.  While many Cubans undoubtedly detest Castro, others genuinely love him. He is the David who stood up to the Goliath of America.  Even after nearly 50 years, he remains a divisive figure."
144,"                           In the aftermath of the disaster at Chernobyl, a team of soviet scientists risked their lives by going back into the reactor to investigate the scale of the damage. The investigation, dubbed Complex Expedition, was driven by the fear that there could be a second accident at Chernobyl if the missing nuclear fuel - plutonium, uranium and other extremely radioactive elements - was not located and contained. Radiation emissions were still dangerously high and the scientists were exposed to levels of radiation that would be considered almost suicidal in the West. At the time, they had been worried that the uncontrollable reactor might explode again, and had to assume that a self-sustaining chain reaction was possible. To prevent this, the Red Army initially bombed the reactor with neutron absorbers and other chemicals. The intense radiation killed several pilots. It is now known that, despite those sacrifices, almost no neutron absorbers reached the core. Inexplicably on May 6th, the emissions stopped. Something had happened in the core of the reactor. Engineers began work on the construction of a concrete sarcophagus to surround the failed reactor to stop rain getting in and triggering a second explosion. Forced to build straight on to the damaged, red hot hull of Chernobyl Unit Four, the Russian energy authorities faced the biggest civil engineering task in history. A quarter of a million construction workers on the Chernobyl sarcophagus reached official lifetime limits of radiation. When the problem seemed to be literally buried, scientists working inside the reactor continued their hunt for nuclear fuel. Collected manually, the cold rods of fuel that turned up could not account for the great heat still emanating from the core. The scientists monitored rates of radiation in the building by drilling into the heart of the sarcophagus and inserting long metal detector tubes into the reactor to measure rates of radioactive decay. As well as radiation, they were exposed to high levels of radioactive dust. Meanwhile, volunteers from the military were working on the exterior of the building, pushing nuclear fuel rods that had been spat out in the blast, back into the reactor ruins. The hunt for nuclear fuel went on for six months before there was any result. Lava, glass and crystal flow discovered in the base of the reactor In December 1986, an intensely radioactive mass was discovered in the basement of Unit Four and scientists rigged up a crude wheeled camera to investigate. The mass was more than two metres across and weighed hundreds of tons. Because of its odd wrinkled shape, it was christened, ""the elephant's foot"". To approach it meant certain death. Analysis of the material showed that it was composed of sand, glass and nuclear fuel, and the proportion of sand suggested to scientists that a large amount of fuel had escaped from the reactor in this form. Underneath the reactor, the investigation team found steaming hot concrete and, draining into the basement, lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms - Chernobylite. The findings meant that the risk of a second explosion had receded, but that serious problems remained. The explosion dislodged the 2000 ton lid of the reactor The walls of the sarcophagus are starting to fall down, having been built straight on top of the collapsed and unstable reactor walls. If the walls collapse, the resulting radioactive dust will escape. The explosion also threw the 2000 ton reactor lid into the air. It fell on its edge into the mouth of the core, and rests at a precarious angle half way down. Scientists who worked on the Complex Exploration say that there are likely to be major collapses in the next ten years without further construction work. Russian research into Chernobyl has now been cut back because of safety problems, and the high death rate - caused by radiation and the stress related conditions - of the scientists involved An alliance of European companies has draw up plans to cover the reactor with a concrete structure designed to last longer than the pyramids, and big enough to allow the work of locating and packaging up radioactive material to continue. So far, the money needed to recover the site has not been found but the contents of the Chernobyl tomb will remain radioactive for at least the next 100,000 years.                             The BBC is not responsible for the content of these internet sites.

145,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The government has expressed its ""sincere regret"" and ""deep sympathy"" to the victims of the thalidomide scandal. Health minister Mike O'Brien made the apology in a statement to MPs - it comes after he unveiled a compensation package for survivors in December. Pregnant women were prescribed the drug in the 1950s and 1960s as a treatment for morning sickness or insomnia. It was withdrawn from sale in 1961 after babies were born with limb deformities and other damage. Mr O'Brien said: ""The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected. Developed in Germany in the 1950s Prescribed as a 'wonder drug' for insomnia, coughs, colds, morning sickness and headaches Link with birth defects shown in 1961 leading to the drug being taken off the market Affected babies commonly suffered missing or deformed limbs and severe shortening of arms or legs The drug also caused malformations of the eyes and ears, heart, genitals, kidneys and digestive tract Scientists believe the drug harmed the growth of new blood vessels in the developing embryo ""We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug, and the challenges that many continue to endure often on a daily basis."" His public statement follows the decision by the government to make more money available to the 466 thalidomide survivors in the UK. The drug's UK manufacturer, Distillers Biochemicals, paid around £28m compensation in the 1970s following a legal battle by the families of those affected. This has been subsequently topped up over the years by successor companies, although the average payout to the 466 survivors in the UK remains below £20,000 a year. The government's £20m funding package is on top of this and will be shared out over the next three years. It reflects the fact that survivors are living longer than expected and as a result will have increasing health needs. The UK was the second biggest user of the drug after Germany. About 2,000 babies were born with problems linked to the drug with half of them dying within months of birth. Another 5,000 were born elsewhere in the world. Guy Tweedy, of the Thalidomide Trust, which distributes aid to survivors, described the apology as ""absolutely wonderful"". Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""I'm highly delighted and so glad that it actually came, 50 years too late but never mind. ""It's an apology not just to thalidomide victims but to the parents who lost their children in the early days."" Mr Tweedy added the apology ""means as much in some ways as the money"". Nick Dobrik, a thalidomide victim and campaigner, added the apology was ""very significant"". He said in particular it meant a lot to the parents of children who had died as it was a way of saying it was the ""government's fault, not theirs"". Stephen O'Brien, the Conservative health spokesman, said: ""I welcome the minister's remarks. Many thalidomiders have indeed waited a long time for this.""     "

147,"The location work in London was in the can and filming for Terry Gilliam's latest production had been about to move to Vancouver in Canada. Then came the untimely death of actor Heath Ledger.  Ledger, 28, had been the biggest name on the cast list of Gilliam's work in progress, the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, and, according to co-star Christopher Plummer, the American-born director had been a ""very good friend"" of Ledger's.  As tributes poured in for the actor, the future of the $30m (£15.4m) film lay in doubt. ""'Parnassus' is shut down,"" said the Hollywood Reporter. But while Plummer speculated to the press that Ledger could be digitally recreated to finish the film, Gilliam seems to have been hatching a more creative solution - enlisting three big name actors to play incarnations of Ledger's character.  According to Jude Law's spokeswoman, Law, Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp will play the role of Ledger's character, Tony, in the film, subject to negotiation. It is thought that original footage of Ledger will remain.  The plan lends a new twist to a problem that has dogged filmmakers since the early days of cinema - how to complete a movie when one of the headliners dies before it's a wrap.  While Gilliam's close friendship with Ledger appears to be an important motivator in his wish to complete Parnassus, the bottom line is often a more compelling reason to keep rolling.  As casting director Carol Dudley recalls being on the MGM lot during the aftershock of Natalie Wood's death, while making Brainstorm in 1981.  ""People wanted to get their money back. They had to find a way to make it work.""  The film was completed with a stand-in and clever camera angles designed to obscure the fact that the screen siren in the frame was not the same as the name which graced the posters for the film.  The body double approach to making up for a death in service has been around at least since 1937 when Jean Harlow died, aged 26, during the making of Saratoga. With filming 90% complete, a lookalike and two Harlow sound-a-likes (voice doubles) took up where the star left off.  But in those days before computer-generated imagery (CGI), pulling off the body double trick convincingly was a tall order - never more so than in the notorious B-movie Plan 9 From Outer Space. Director Ed Wood had only bagged about two minutes of footage of lead actor Bela Lugosi for the film when the actor died of a heart attack.  Undeterred, Wood rewrote the script and enlisted chiropractor Tom Mason, who stood a foot taller than Lugosi, for the role. Wood tried to conceal the stark difference in height between the two men by having the stand-in stoop. As for the lack of facial similarity, Mason cloaked his face with a Dracula-like cape.  The film was panned, but Dan Jolin, features editor of Empire magazine, says it was all part of Wood's charm.  ""Ed Wood was a singular filmmaker and wouldn't let anything stop him from making the film he wanted to make. It's so obvious the guy standing in for him is a different height. But in a film with wobbly gravestones and flying saucers hanging from bits of string it actually works.""  The advent of CGI lent a more professional edge to filling in for newly deceased actors. Probably the first film to use computers to this effect, says Jolin, was John Candy's last movie, Wagons East.  ""They finished the film without him and used footage of him that was tweaked but it was weird and uneven and it felt like Candy wasn't really in it.""  By the time of Oliver Reed's death, on the set of Gladiator, in 1999, computer effects had progressed to such an extent that Reed's living, breathing absence was barely noticeable. If there was a crack, says Jolin, it was more in the continuity.  ""The only slightly jarring thing was [Reed] was going to live in the film. There was a line he said to Russell Crowe in the film and that was used as the final line and it felt clunky.""  By comparison, Gilliam's novel solution to Ledger's death is consciously low-tech. But the director's biographer, Bob McCabe, says he believes the solution is a ""brilliant idea"" and characteristic of Gilliam's ""fantastic imagination"".  ""If you are a filmmaker you have a responsibility to try to get the film made, but it has to be true to itself.""  Carol Dudley notes Gilliam's idea would be unthinkable in a ""straight thriller. [But] filmmakers like Terry Gilliam are walking a line between hyper-reality and fantasy and so can get away with this sort of idea.""  ""It's something his films can rise to,"" says Dudley. ""Why not make lemonade from the lemon rather than sweep it under the carpet.""  I have seen Brainstorm countless times and, being unaware of the fact that Wood died during filming, have never noticed her absence.  Nancy Bang, Esbjerg, Denmark  Bruce Lee's last film, Game Of Death, features stand-in doubles, cardboard cutouts, and an actor wearing a paper mask with Bruce's photograph printed on it!  Andy, London  It's worth mentioning the first effective use of CGI to complete a film where one of the leads has ""died in service"" was The Crow. After Brandon Lee's tragic death, the film was completed using digital composites from existing footage of Lee.   Dermot Canniffe, Galway, Ireland  I find it amazing what can be achieved these days. I recall watching The Crow - where Brandon Lee died mid-way through filming - and being totally unable to see what is 'genuine' Brandon and the late fill-ins. I'm sure Gilliams fix will be most effective. I just continue to find it very sad that events have occurred which means he has to do this.   Merson Tuffers, Staffs, UK  The notion that Gilliam's solution is novel though, I find hard to believe. Its seems very similar to the idea of 'I'm Not There' - the film in which Heath Ledger himself was just one of the actors playing the character of Bob Dylan along with the likes of Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett.   Charlie, Cambridge  Gilliam's idea is nothing new - David Lynch did it purposely in 'Lost Highway', when Bill Pullman's character is incarcerated, and the next morning has transformed into Balthazar Getty, playing a completely different character - baffling both the police and the audience in typical Lynch fashion.   Martin Conaghan, Glasgow  It's nice to see the film industry using an idea first introduced in Doctor Who. But I bet they won't acknowledge it!  Mick Clarke, Elland West Yorkshire"
148,"Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr died at his home in Columbus, Ohio, aged 92.  The five-ton ""Little Boy"" bomb was dropped on the morning of 6 August 1945, killing about 140,000 Japanese, with many more dying later.  On the 60th anniversary of the bombing, the three surviving crew members of the Enola Gay - named after Tibbet's mother - said they had ""no regrets"".  A friend of the retired brigadier-general told AP news agency that Paul Tibbets had died after a two-month decline in health.  Gen Tibbets had asked for no funeral nor headstone as he feared opponents of the bombing may use it as a place of protest, the friend, Gerry Newhouse, said.  The bombing of Hiroshima marked the beginning of the end of the war in the Pacific.  Japan surrendered shortly after a second bomb was dropped, on Nagasaki, three days later.  On the 60th anniversary of Hiroshima, the surviving members of the Enola Gay crew - Gen Tibbets, Theodore J ""Dutch"" Van Kirk (the navigator) and Morris R Jeppson (weapon test officer) said: ""The use of the atomic weapon was a necessary moment in history. We have no regrets"".  Gen Tibbets said then: ""Thousands of former soldiers and military family members have expressed a particularly touching and personal gratitude suggesting that they might not be alive today had it been necessary to resort to an invasion of the Japanese home islands to end the fighting.""  Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr was born in Quincy, Illinois, in 1915 and spent most of his youth in Miami.  He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1937 and led bombing operations in Europe before returning to test the Superfortress.  He retired from the forces in 1966.  In a 1975 interview he said: ""I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did... I sleep clearly every night.""  In 1976, Gen Tibbets was criticised for re-enacting the bombing at an air show in Texas.  A mushroom cloud was set off as he over flew in a B-29 Superfortress in a stunt that outraged Japan. Gen Tibbets said it was not meant as an insult but the US government formally apologised.  In 1995, Gen Tibbets denounced as a ""damn big insult"" a planned 50th anniversary exhibition of the Enola Gay at the Smithsonian Institution that put the bombing in context of the suffering it caused.  He and veterans groups said too much attention was being paid to Japan's suffering and not enough to its military brutality."
149,"The BBC's security correspondent, Frank Gardner, can reveal that Arab soldiers have been taking part in dangerous missions alongside US troops in Afghanistan. Troops from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been delivering humanitarian aid to their fellow Muslims and, on occasion, fighting their way out of Taleban ambushes. Though Jordanian forces have been carrying out some base security duties, the UAE's troops are the only Arab soldiers undertaking full-scale operations in the country. Until now, their deployment has been kept so secret that not even their own countrymen knew they were here. In a windowless room, surrounded by sandbags, the Emirati patrol commander briefs his troops for tomorrow's mission: a hearts-and-minds visit to an Afghan village. We try to convince the people about the US, about British. They came here to give you peace.    His troops are dressed in desert fatigues, topped with sand-coloured shemaghs, the traditional wrap-around headdress of the Gulf. When the patrol moves out through the mountain valleys, it looks exactly like any other convoy from the US-led coalition. The Emiratis are on their guard, wary of ambush, alert for roadside bombs. At the last minute, the village they had originally planned to visit was deemed too dangerous: the Americans could not guarantee to provide air cover. So they travel instead to one they have been to before, to hand out gifts and discuss what projects need building. As fellow Muslims, they get a warm reception from the villagers. ""At first I thought these were American soldiers and I wanted them to leave but when they said they were Muslims I knew they were our brothers,"" a young Afghan man says. Hajji Fazlullah, another Afghan villager, says: ""The Arab troops come in our country and our village, we are very happy."" Of course, these are not the only coalition troops giving out aid to Afghans. But what is really winning hearts and minds is the Islamic connection. The Arabs use a shared Islamic faith to bond with the Afghans In a sunlit courtyard, a small boy recites the Koran from memory, watched by his proud father, and by the UAE's Maj Ghanem Al-Mazroui. Unlike most western military officers, he has spent over two years getting to know these villagers, eating and praying with them. But handing out humanitarian aid in Afghanistan is not as easy as it sounds. As the crowd builds up rumour spreads that there is not enough to go round and people surge forward. The Afghan police wade in, pushing and hitting the villagers. More than once, Maj Ghanem has to restrain them. Without sensitive handling, the situation could easily descend into a riot. There is even a scramble for the empty cardboard boxes. But eventually the Arab troops manage to restore order and they leave without a shot being fired. Still, it is going to come as a surprise to most people that for the last five years, an Arab Muslim army has been operating here in Afghanistan, alongside the Americans as part of the coalition. Afghans seem to respond well to UAE troops efforts' to help them So I asked Maj Ghanem whether he was worried about how some people in the Arab world might react to this. ""We have an answer for that. Even if you are asking back in the UAE or in the Gulf, or you asking here, we have the same answer,"" he said. ""We make a contract with the US Army to help the people down here, not to fight"". But I put it to him that in fact his troops have been fighting insurgents as well as handing out aid. ""If we have any types of personal attacks we react with fire. And after that we go to the elders in this area: 'Why are you shooting us? We came here to help you. ""'If you have the same picture of all coalition forces, we are different. We came here to help you.' ""And we try to convince the people about the US, about British. They came here to give you peace."" The man who kick-started the Arab humanitarian effort in Afghanistan five years ago is Hamad al-Shamsi, the UAE's humanitarian aid co-ordinator. A devout Muslim, a father of 10, and a former fighter pilot, he has been travelling all over Afghanistan, often at great personal risk. The UAE troops in convoy look much like the other coalition forces He believes his country's efforts are smoothing a path for the rest of the coalition. ""If we are visiting [somewhere] like this village and we do some service for them, then the coalition will know when they are approaching that there is somebody from their side who is coming here who has done something for us,"" Mr Shamsi says. ""So the relations will be easier than if they come directly with no first approach"". His words are born out by some of the Afghans we meet, including Governor Merajudeen Patan, who was instrumental in getting UAE's money invested in the troubled province of Khost. ""People are not afraid that Emiratis will harm their religion, or disrespect the mosque or burn the mosque, things of this nature,"" Governor Patan says. ""People are very friendly with them. Everybody will drag them in for lunch or for dinner."" These are hearts-and-minds operations at their most effective - drinking tea with Afghans, discussing what help can be provided. The Emirati approach is to meet their fellow Muslims' religious needs first, then build schools and clinics later. But for this to have a wider, lasting, and national effect, the blueprint would need to be repeated and expanded by others, many times over and throughout Afghanistan. And that is not likely to happen in the near future."
150,"The US fast food industry and health campaigners are watching closely a lawsuit filed on behalf of several obese teenagers who claim the fast-food company McDonald's is responsible for making them fat.  The lawsuit, filed by lawyer Samuel Hirsch in a Manhattan federal court, alleges that McDonald's violated New York state's consumer fraud statutes by deliberately misleading consumers into thinking their cheeseburgers and other products were healthy and nutritious.  It says the company did not adequately provide information on the health risks associated with fast food, and the children developed health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity from eating its products.  McDonald's has asked the court to dismiss the case.  Mr Hirsch said the lawsuit raised ""serious issues"".  Mr Hirsch says that, if the case goes to trial, he will seek to turn it into a class action suit, meaning it can represent other children in the state who claim they have developed health problems stemming from McDonald's food.  If successful, fast-food companies fear that it could trigger a rash of further suits and huge payouts to victims - potentially running into billions of dollars - similar to those that have severely damaged the tobacco industry.  The mother of one of the children, who at the age of 15 weighs more than 180 kilograms (400 pounds), said in papers filed before the court that ""[I had] always believed McDonald's was healthy for my son.""  Another teenager ate every meal at McDonald's for three years while living in a homeless shelter, the Associated Press news agency reported.  However McDonald's has asked presiding Judge Robert Sweet to dismiss the suit, describing it as frivolous.  ""People don't go to sleep thin and wake up obese,"" McDonald's lawyer Brad Lerman said.  ""The understanding and comprehension of what hamburgers and French fries do has been with us for a long, long time.""  The action follows an earlier suit filed in July by a group of overweight Americans who sued several US fast food giants accusing them of knowingly serving meals that cause obesity and disease.  The lawsuit - filed in New York State Supreme Court in the Bronx - said that McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken misled customers by enticing them with greasy, salty and sugary food.  A recent assessment of obesity in the US found that more than half of all adult Americans were overweight.  About 54 million adults were classified as obese - that is people who are about 15 kg or more over the healthy norm based on height - and hundreds of thousands of deaths each year are attributed to obesity-related diseases.  The situation is so serious that President George W Bush has urged Americans to follow a fitness regime to assuage the country's spiralling health care costs."

Tim: Yes, I think none of that's true except the bit about my perspiring a lot. I do do that, I have to say. Yes, I'll accept that. I'm very pleased with that. Move on..    Barry, Humph describes you thus: ""The gag man. There are no embarrassing silences thanks to you...    Barry: Embarrassing noises but not silences.  Inteviewer: ...bottomless pit of one-liners, able to come up with gags at a second's notice, provides the bricks and mortar.""  Barry: And they let me appear in it sometimes as well. I bring my wheelbarrow. It's very gracious of him though, particularly about my quick wit.  Tim: Anyway, what would he know?

Tim: Very dry as opposed to the very sweaty me, is that what he's saying?   Barry: Was that Humph who said that?  Interviewer: Yes.  Barry: I detect a very Graeme style in that.  Graeme: I put a stop to the fun basically is what he's saying.  Tim: Yes, but you bide your time about it.    Humph's very modest about his own comic abilities. What do you think his particular gifts are?    Barry: He's very arrogant, overbearing and quite ruthless.  Tim: I've been a fan of his since I was a teenager. I used to go listen to his band which still plays magnificently today. And I still get a thrill out of working with Humph. It's extraordinary, after all these years. He's such an incredibly nice and bright man and he is modest, but he shouldn't be. I think he's quite fantastic.  Barry: I still think 'It's him, it's him!'.    How much of his stuff is written and how much is ad-libbed?    Tim: Well, he is capable of writing everything but Iain Pattinson actually writes his script now. I think Iain would say that the great thing is you're writing for a great man. There's nothing worse for a writer than to write something that is delivered badly. Iain writes some good stuff and Humph makes it even better which is perfect for a writer.  Graeme: And, obviously, the nature of the show is not all scripted. Humph reads his links then we play the games and Humph says injections of his own and very often they're show-stoppers as well. He's an extremely funny man. I don't think he knows how funny he is or how he is funny which is probably a good thing - he just does it.  Barry: He's in a great tradition like Kenneth Horne was in Round the Horne - the obeying man in the middle with all the idiots milling about and he's never quite sure what's going on but he just wants to get it over.  Tim: And the seeming innocence allows him to be absolutely filthy. ""Humph can't have said that, can he?"" And, of course, everything he says is double entendre anyway and he looks really, genuinely surprised if the audience laughs. As Graeme says, he can ad-lib as well. I remember something he said during our recording on Sunday. He said something like ""Your hand writing is so bad, I have to pin it up and run past it to read it."" I don't quite know what it means but it made me laugh enormously.         Back to Interviews...     "
152,"Sheard gained wider fame as Admiral Ozzel in 1980 Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back.  His other films included Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade - one of a string of appearances as Adolf Hitler - and he was a regular guest in Doctor Who.  His agent said he had cancer and died at home on the Isle of Wight.  In Grange Hill, his stern manner and cries of ""You, boy"" as deputy head Maurice Bronson made him one of TV's most memorable figures.  With a series of roles in Doctor Who spanning more than 20 years, he boasted that he starred alongside more Doctors than any other actor.  He was even touted as a potential Doctor himself. ""Things got in the way,"" he told the BBC's Wiltshire website in 2003. ""It would have been fun to do.""  In Star Wars, he was memorably choked by Darth Vader - and said George Lucas told him it was ""the best screen death I've ever seen"".  At the time, Star Wars was ""just another part in a very busy actor's career"", he said, but it has secured him a place in the hearts of Star Wars fans and an Admiral Ozzel action figure came out last year.  He played Hitler five times and Himmler three times - but said playing Goering's double in sitcom 'Allo 'Allo was his worst performance.  Other film appearances included Raiders of the Lost Ark, All Quiet On The Western Front and The Dirty Dozen - Second Assignment.  He appeared alongside Dame Peggy Ashcroft in 1980 TV movie Caught on a Train and said Escape to Athena with Roger Moore was his favourite role.  Moore wrote the foreword to the first of three autobiographies, Yes, Mr Bronson: Memoirs of a Bum Actor, published in 1997.  Sheard once said he ""wouldn't have missed dear old Bronson for anything"".  ""He was scary, but as an actor Mr Bronson was a lovely part to play."""
153,"A record 70 million passengers used Heathrow last year, boosting the airport's revenues by 8% to £2.46bn.  The airport, the UK's busiest, is operating at close to capacity, with 471,341 flights during 2012, just below the legal limit of 480,000 a year.  Passenger numbers fell by 400,000 during the Olympics, as Britons stayed home to enjoy the Games and the number of inward-bound travellers dipped.  The chief executive of Heathrow again warned about a lack of capacity.  Colin Matthews said a decision on new airport capacity was ""urgent"", because of competition from rival airports in Europe and the Middle East.  The results published on Monday include Stansted airport, which was sold to Manchester Airports Group for £1.5bn. Stansted's passenger numbers fell 3.2% to 17.5 million last year.  The company said construction of the new Heathrow Terminal 2 should be completed towards the end of 2013, with operations commencing in mid-2014.  The project accounted for a large slice of the £1.1bn invested in the airport during 2012, an increase of more than 30% on a year earlier."
154,"Although most of the Bloody Sunday Tribunal evidence was heard in Londonderry, the soldiers who were there on 30 January 1972 appeared in London amid security concerns.  Soldiers who were on the ground at the time of the shootings gave evidence anonymously. They were not granted immunity from prosecution; only immunity from self-incrimination.  Colonel Wilford was directly in charge of the soldiers who went into the Bogside to arrest rioters. It was his job to run a successful operation to round up trouble-makers, protect the public and get his troops back to base unharmed.  But Saville concludes that the soldiers only went into the Bogside because the colonel went further than his orders from Brigadier MacLellan. His superior wanted to avoid running battles that would make it impossible to distinguish between rioters and peaceful marchers.  ""Colonel Wilford either deliberately disobeyed Brigadier MacLellan's order or failed for no good reason to appreciate the clear limits of what he had been authorised to do,"" said Saville.  ""Colonel Wilford decided to send Support Company into the Bogside because at the time he gave the order he had concluded (without informing Brigadier MacLellan) that there was now no prospect of making any, or any significant, arrests in the area he had originally suggested, as the rioting was dying down and people were moving away.  ""In addition it appears to us that he wanted to demonstrate that the way to deal with rioters in Londonderry was not for soldiers to shelter behind barricades like (as he put it) ""Aunt Sallies"" while being stoned, as he perceived the local troops had been doing, but instead to go aggressively after rioters, as he and his soldiers had been doing in Belfast.  ""What Colonel Wilford failed to appreciate, or regarded as of little consequence, was that his soldiers… would almost certainly be unable to identify anyone as a rioter.""  Col Wilford was exonerated by the Widgery tribunal and six months after the event he was awarded the Order of the British Empire by the Queen.  The Saville inquiry found that one soldier, Lance Corporal F killed Patrick Doherty, Michael Kelly, Bernard McGuigan and possibly also William McKinney and James Wray.  The report says: ""Lance Corporal F did not fire in a state of fear or panic. We are sure that he fired either in the belief that no-one in the area into which he fired was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or not caring whether or not anyone there was posing such a threat.""  Other soldiers who definitely killed were R, G, U. In other cases it is too difficult to work out who exactly was responsible.  ""With the exception of Private T [and another soldier in one specific incident], none of the firing by the soldiers of Support Company was aimed at people posing a threat of causing death or serious injury.""  ""We have concluded, for the reasons we give, that apart from Private T many of these soldiers have knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing.""  In early 1972, the general was commander of land forces and increasingly concerned that the army had no control over a large part of Derry. He wanted to see rioters dealt with swifty.  The inquiry learnt of the existence of a memo, written by Sir Robert in January 1972, in which he suggested shooting (but not killing) some of the ringleaders of the rioting, known as the ""Derry Young Hooligans"". In the general's mind the army was ""virtually incapable"" against these gangs, because they operated under the cover of snipers.  Lord Saville's report said the panel were ""surprised"" that the general should have seriously considered such a plan and did not believe it had been adopted.  But the inquiry said he could not be criticised for deploying soldiers to arrest rioters, although he had probably sent the wrong unit.  ""In our view his decision to use 1 PARA as the arrest force is open to criticism, on the ground that 1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists in Londonderry.  ""However, there is to our minds a significant difference between the risk of soldiers using excessive physical violence when dispersing crowds or trying to arrest rioters and the risk that they would use lethal weapons without justification.""  The inquiry concluded the general had no reason to expect the tragedy that then unfolded. It accepted his denial in evidence that he sent 1 Para in to provoke republican gunmen to confront them in the street.  Brigadier MacLellan had the power to launch arrest operations against rioters during the day - and the inquiry accepted that he delayed launching that plan until he believed there was sufficient separation between their targets and the marchers.  Saville concluded he had no reason to believe that lives were at stake if the team led by Colonel Wilford went in. The inquiry said that his proposed arrest operation did not include storming the Bogside.  ""We have concluded that Brigadier MacLellan does not bear any responsibility for the deaths and injuries from the unjustifiable firing by soldiers on Bloody Sunday.""  Saville exonerates Major Ted Loden, the commander in charge of soldiers following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Families said the major could have stopped the soldiers from firing.  The report says that events moved so fast ""after the soldiers disembarked in the Bogside that Major Loden had no idea what was actually going on; he assumed that his soldiers had come under attack from republican paramilitaries and were responding.  ""At the time the casualties were being sustained, Major Loden neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat.""  General Sir Mike Jackson, the former head of the British Army, was a Parachute Regiment captain on the day and the second in command of 1 Para.  In the aftermath of the shootings, he wrote up what became known as the ""Loden List of Engagements"".  This was a brief account of what soldiers had told Major Loden about why they had fired. Sir Mike told the inquiry that the list was simply an operational record of shots fired - not an investigative document. He had simply transcribed what he had been told.  Families said that the document was an attempt to conceal the truth by presenting each victim as a bomber or gunman. The list was referred to by senior officers in press briefings in the hours after the killings.  Saville said that the circumstances under which the list was compiled were ""far from ideal"".  But the report added: ""We accept Captain Jackson's evidence of the purpose for which the list was initially prepared; and find nothing sinister in the fact that it did not include details such as the names of the soldiers and the number of rounds fired.  ""However, the list did play a role in the Army's explanations of what occurred on the day."""
155,"Although most of the Bloody Sunday Tribunal evidence was heard in Londonderry, the soldiers who were there on 30 January 1972 appeared in London amid security concerns.  Soldiers who were on the ground at the time of the shootings gave evidence anonymously. They were not granted immunity from prosecution; only immunity from self-incrimination.  Colonel Wilford was directly in charge of the soldiers who went into the Bogside to arrest rioters. It was his job to run a successful operation to round up trouble-makers, protect the public and get his troops back to base unharmed.  But Saville concludes that the soldiers only went into the Bogside because the colonel went further than his orders from Brigadier MacLellan. His superior wanted to avoid running battles that would make it impossible to distinguish between rioters and peaceful marchers.  ""Colonel Wilford either deliberately disobeyed Brigadier MacLellan's order or failed for no good reason to appreciate the clear limits of what he had been authorised to do,"" said Saville.  ""Colonel Wilford decided to send Support Company into the Bogside because at the time he gave the order he had concluded (without informing Brigadier MacLellan) that there was now no prospect of making any, or any significant, arrests in the area he had originally suggested, as the rioting was dying down and people were moving away.  ""In addition it appears to us that he wanted to demonstrate that the way to deal with rioters in Londonderry was not for soldiers to shelter behind barricades like (as he put it) ""Aunt Sallies"" while being stoned, as he perceived the local troops had been doing, but instead to go aggressively after rioters, as he and his soldiers had been doing in Belfast.  ""What Colonel Wilford failed to appreciate, or regarded as of little consequence, was that his soldiers… would almost certainly be unable to identify anyone as a rioter.""  Col Wilford was exonerated by the Widgery tribunal and six months after the event he was awarded the Order of the British Empire by the Queen.  The Saville inquiry found that one soldier, Lance Corporal F killed Patrick Doherty, Michael Kelly, Bernard McGuigan and possibly also William McKinney and James Wray.  The report says: ""Lance Corporal F did not fire in a state of fear or panic. We are sure that he fired either in the belief that no-one in the area into which he fired was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or not caring whether or not anyone there was posing such a threat.""  Other soldiers who definitely killed were R, G, U. In other cases it is too difficult to work out who exactly was responsible.  ""With the exception of Private T [and another soldier in one specific incident], none of the firing by the soldiers of Support Company was aimed at people posing a threat of causing death or serious injury.""  ""We have concluded, for the reasons we give, that apart from Private T many of these soldiers have knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing.""  In early 1972, the general was commander of land forces and increasingly concerned that the army had no control over a large part of Derry. He wanted to see rioters dealt with swifty.  The inquiry learnt of the existence of a memo, written by Sir Robert in January 1972, in which he suggested shooting (but not killing) some of the ringleaders of the rioting, known as the ""Derry Young Hooligans"". In the general's mind the army was ""virtually incapable"" against these gangs, because they operated under the cover of snipers.  Lord Saville's report said the panel were ""surprised"" that the general should have seriously considered such a plan and did not believe it had been adopted.  But the inquiry said he could not be criticised for deploying soldiers to arrest rioters, although he had probably sent the wrong unit.  ""In our view his decision to use 1 PARA as the arrest force is open to criticism, on the ground that 1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists in Londonderry.  ""However, there is to our minds a significant difference between the risk of soldiers using excessive physical violence when dispersing crowds or trying to arrest rioters and the risk that they would use lethal weapons without justification.""  The inquiry concluded the general had no reason to expect the tragedy that then unfolded. It accepted his denial in evidence that he sent 1 Para in to provoke republican gunmen to confront them in the street.  Brigadier MacLellan had the power to launch arrest operations against rioters during the day - and the inquiry accepted that he delayed launching that plan until he believed there was sufficient separation between their targets and the marchers.  Saville concluded he had no reason to believe that lives were at stake if the team led by Colonel Wilford went in. The inquiry said that his proposed arrest operation did not include storming the Bogside.  ""We have concluded that Brigadier MacLellan does not bear any responsibility for the deaths and injuries from the unjustifiable firing by soldiers on Bloody Sunday.""  Saville exonerates Major Ted Loden, the commander in charge of soldiers following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Families said the major could have stopped the soldiers from firing.

156,"The spinner, 35, bowled England's Paul Collingwood in the first Test in Kandy to claim his 709th Test victim.  Muralitharan reached the mark in his 116th Test - 29 fewer than Warne - and has conceded only 21.77 runs per wicket compared to the Australian's 25.41.  He was four behind Warne before the series began but took his fifth wicket of the match to claim the record.  England kept Muralitharan at bay during his first spell of the third morning but he struck immediately in his second, bowling Collingwood from around the wicket.  It was in front of his home crowd and they went wild as firecrackers were set off to mark the moment of history.  Muralitharan was hugged by his team-mates, with his proud wife and son watching from the stands.  It was a huge moment in cricket, and a vivid contrast from Sri Lanka's November Test tour of Australia, where Muralitharan took 4-400 in a 2-0 series defeat.  He said: ""It's my hometown, my parents are here, my wife is here... all the relatives are here and all my schoolfriends.  ""Everybody is here. It's a bigger moment than if I had taken it in Australia, it's the right time I think. It's not easy to take six wickets in an innings, I managed to let my pressure off now.""  And he admitted his record-taking ball had not spun as he had wanted it too.  ""I tried to spin the ball and it went the other way, but that's a special wicket,"" Muralitharan said.  He ended the first innings with 6-55 - 710 Test wickets.  The feat marked a new high in the 15-year career of one of the most celebrated bowlers of the modern game, whose controversial bent-arm action has been questioned in the past by umpires.  Muralitharan had held the record before when he surpassed West Indies' Courtney Walsh's 519 wickets in 2004.  But he suffered a shoulder injury later that year and was then overtaken by Warne.  Muralitharan holds several other records in Test cricket including the most five-wicket hauls (61) and 10-wicket hauls (20).  He said his 1998 performance at The Oval against England, when he took 16 wickets, was his career highlight.  ""Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn't look back from there.  ""I like to be a bowler because I can't bat properly. After 17 years of cricket I have got the opportunities and made the wickets fall."""
157,"The money will come out of BT's cash resources.  Cellnet is the UK's second largest mobile telephone operator with over five million customers. Vodafone is the market leader, with Orange and One-2-One the runner-ups.  BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield said: ""Following the success of our partnership with Securicor, BT is pleased to have the opportunity to increase its investment in the UK mobile telephony market at this exciting time.""  He said the acquisition would leave BT ""well-placed to capitalise on the opportunities presented by Second and Third Generation Mobile technology in the highly competitive UK mobile market.""  Securicor shareholders can now expect a direct payment, while the deal effectively creates a new Securicor group whose shares will be distributed to the company's existing shareholders.  BT has long wanted to fully own its mobile service, as it has watched rivals grab market share and launch innovative marketing schemes.  But it has previously been inhibited by the fear of regulatory disapproval. In April the government lifted the ban.  It is rebranding the service BT Cellnet, and will offer combined wire telephone and mobile service accounts.  Although Securicor was not able to gain as much as it might have from a sale on the open market, the sale gives the company a massive return on its original investment of just £4m in Cellnet in 1983.  The UK mobile phone industry is expanding rapidly, with the introduction of pay-as-you-talk schemes adding customers.  Over 1 million customers acquired mobile phones in the last three months alone, and 17m are now in use in the UK, representing one-quarter of the population.  But Cellnet has lagged behind its rival Vodafone in expanding internationally. Vodafone became the world's biggest mobile phone company when it acquired Airtouch earlier in the year.  The announcement of a new generation of mobile phone licences, which will allow data and Internet transmission, is a crucial stage in the future development of the sector.  The price of mobile calls has also fallen sharply, and continuing investigations by the regulator Oftel is likely to ensure that trend continues."
158,"Early morning planes arriving at Heathrow are being directed to more defined flight paths, in a trial aimed at giving residents respite from noise.  The aim is to protect people in dedicated areas from unpredictable aircraft noise between 04:30 and 06:00.  Normally the flight paths into the airport are spread across London.  The scheme is a partnership between Heathrow, British Airways, the National Air Traffic Service and HACAN, which campaigns against aircraft noise.  On average about 17 flights arrive at Heathrow each morning between 04:30 and 06:00.  Air traffic controllers normally direct these aircraft to achieve the safest and most efficient arrival routes, spreading out their flight paths.  The Early Morning Noise Respite Trial will look at whether the flights, in particular those at the beginning of their approach into Heathrow, can be routed in a more defined way.  The trial will work by defining two zones over each trial area. Each zone will take turns to be active on a weekly basis.  Pilots will be directed by air traffic control to avoid flying through whichever zone is active for that particular week.  Matt Gorman, Heathrow's sustainability director, said: ""A relatively small adjustment in terms of the flight path can have a big impact on those living underneath it.""  HACAN chairman John Stewart said: ""Periods of respite are very important for residents under the flight paths. We welcome this initiative.""  Whether the aircraft land from the east or west depends on the wind direction, so there will be four trial areas, two to the east of the airport and two to the west.  These areas cover places such as Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Battersea, Clapham Common, Westminster, Bermondsey and Streatham to the east of the airport, and Binfield, Reading, Purley-on-Thames and Winnersh to the west of the airport.  The trial will run for five months."
159,"Bolivia's lithium reserves could bring wealth to the country High in the Andes, in a remote corner of Bolivia, lies more than half the world's reserves of a mineral that could radically reduce our reliance on dwindling fossil fuels. Lithium carries a great promise. It could help power the fuel efficient electric or petrol-electric hybrid vehicles of the future. But, as is the case with fossil fuels, it is a limited resource. Lithium carbonate is already in the batteries of laptop computers and mobile phones. It is used because it allows more energy to be stored in a lighter, smaller space than most alternatives. And as the auto industry rushes to produce new fuel efficient and electric cars, it too is turning to lithium batteries as its first choice to boost the power of their new models. GM has one in its new hybrid Volt, Toyota is testing one in its next generation hybrid Prius. Mercedes is testing an electric version of its Smart, while BMW is doing the same with its Mini. And Nissan-Renault, Mitsubishi and VW are all rushing to buy or produce enough of the batteries to power their future models. The best of the pure electric cars can reach ranges of more than 150 kilometres per charge. Mitsubishi, which plans to release its own electric car soon, estimates that the demand for lithium will outstrip supply in less than 10 years unless new sources are found. And they have ended up in Bolivia. ""The demand for lithium won't double but increase by five times,"" according to Eichi Maeyama Mitsubishi's general manager in La Paz. ""We will need more lithium sources - and 50% of the world's reserves of lithium exist in Bolivia, in the Salar de Uyuni,"" he adds, pointing out that without new production, the price of lithium will rise prohibitively. Lithium is found in rocks and sea water. Locals fear the benefits will not be passed on But almost all the commercially exploitable reserves are found in the brine under salt flats. The world's largest reserves lie in Bolivia at the Salar de Uyuni - in the remote southern Andean plane. But Bolivia is not a country known to be friendly to foreign industry. Its socialist president, Evo Morales, is keen to expand state control over its natural resources, a task carried out by Bolivia's minister for mining, Luis Alberto Echazu. ""We want to send a message to the industrialized countries and their companies,"" Mr Echazu says. ""We will not repeat the historical experience since the fifteenth century: raw materials exported for the industrialisation of the west that has left us poor."" Gold, silver, tin, oil and gas have all been found and exported from here whilst the country remains the poorest in the region. They probably don't have a lot of experience of doing this sort of thing themselves so they'll have to bring in expertise and technology    For President Morales' supporters, that is reason enough not to allow in foreign mining companies to extract the lithium. Across the flats, freelance miners work to break up the surface salt selling it to passing trucks for just a few dollars. Indigenous and poor, they are core supporters of the president. A grizzled old miner, giving his name only as Alfredo, says he does not believe that lithium will ever be extracted. ""We don't want to see foreign companies here,"" he says. ""It would be very bad, as the government says."" Alfredo's hopes for the future are modest. ""I just want to work until I die"" he says, a smile across his face. It is not an uncommon sentiment here. In spite of the grinding poverty here, attempts in the 1980's and 1990's by foreign companies to extract the lithium met with resistance from the community. Bolivia is concerned about damage to the environment They say the money would go elsewhere. Francisco Quisbert is a local activist with President Morales' party who took part in the resistance. Now he is working with the president to hammer out a new plan for a state-owned pilot plant on the flats. ""We don't want international involvement,"" he says. ""This plan has raised the hopes of the region. ""Before our grandparents lived on the salt. They arrived from the valleys in caravans of llamas, but the market forced them to leave. ""We want to return to live on the salar [and] improve our living conditions and to participate in the project."" To begin with the pilot plant will produce no more than 1.2 kilotonnes a year. If an industrial plant is then built it may increase to around 30 kilotonnes by 2012, - thats just under a third of current production. But most lithium now goes to small batteries for electronic goods. Car batteries are far larger and Mitsubishi estimates the world will need 500 kilotonnes a year just to service a niche market. For electric cars to become the norm, it could need far more. Mitsubishi predicts that there will be a supply shortage by 2015. Analysts suspect that Bolivia's government can produce this much. ""Governments in South America have had a very successful history of mining,"" explains Charles Kernot, a mining analyst at Evolution Securities. But the question is how fast. ""They probably don't have a lot of experience of doing this sort of thing themselves so they'll have to bring in expertise and technology,"" Mr Kernot adds. ""That whole process may take a lot longer than people are anticipating."" Consequently, he continues, ""the car manufacturers will have to strike a balance between how quickly they manufacture with the supply of metal because they don't want to drive the price up to such an extent that the cars get priced out of the market"". Long-term, Bolivia's government is wary of the environmental damage mass extraction could cause. The mining minister, Mr Eschazu, has a stark message for Western firms. ""The capitalist leaders have to change,"" he says. ""If all the world had consumers like North America, everyone with a car, it would grind to a halt. ""It is also going to generate pollution, not just from fossil fuels but also from lithium plants, which produce sulphur dioxide. This isn't a magic solution."" It is not a view likely to go down well in the offices of Toyota and General Motors.     "
160,"Original advice suggested that foods such as butter, meat, cheese and eggs could be eaten ""liberally"".  Now, however, Atkins Nutritionals suggests that intake of saturated fats should be limited to 20% of total calories.  The change of tack will come as a relief to nutrition experts who say that a high-fat diet poses a health risk to some.  In the UK, the website of the Food Standards Agency expressed concern about the makeup of the diet, which heavily restricts certain food groups such as carbohydrates - for example bread and pasta.  High levels of protein intake might also pose a threat to patients with certain medical conditions, it is claimed.  However, millions in the UK have tried the diet, and many say it has helped them lose weight with minimal or no unpleasant side-effects.  They say that the emphasis on fresh food - and bans on high-sugar processed food - has in itself led to healthier eating.  She said: ""The media and opponents of Atkins often sensationalise and simplify the diet as the all-the-steak-you-can-eat diet. This has never been true.""  A spokesman for the UK arm of the company said: ""The whole idea is to reduce your carbohydrate, but it is not all about red meat.  ""Not all fats are bad for you, but like anything, they should be taken in moderation.""  However, a spokesman for the US arm of the company said that the advice did not represent a change of tack.  She said: ""Saturated fat remains a valuable part of the Atkins nutritional approach.  ""And there is absolutely no science to support any claims that eating red meat and saturated fat as part of your Atkins programme is anything other then beneficial.""  ""That means fruit and veg and bread and cereals, and less fats, salt and sugar.""  The agency recommends that 11% of calorie intake should come from fats."
161,"Ministers have agreed that public buildings should fly Scotland's Saltire flag on St Andrew's Day.  The Scottish Executive announced a review of an order which called for the Union Flag to be flown in preference to the country's national flag.  Scottish National Party MSP Mike Russell welcomed what he described as ""a rapid climbdown"".  But said the situation should never have arisen in the first place.  The row broke out after it emerged that Historic Scotland, which cares for 330 castles and historic properties, could not fly the Saltire on ""special"" days because of rules giving priority to the Union Flag.  Historic Scotland would normally fly its own flag - with the Saltire being preferred if there were two poles available.  However on days earmarked by the government, the Union Flag must be flown - effectively meaning that the Saltire could be displayed.  These dates include St Andrew's Day - 30 November - the Queen's birthday and her official birthday, Commonwealth Day and even the Queen's wedding anniversary.  Mr Russell said it was ""bizarre"" that the Saltire could not be flown on Scotland's national day.  He tabled parliamentary questions about the matter, saying that he hoped ""this forelock tugging madness"" would be quickly overturned.  He warned: ""If not Scotland will become the laughing stock of the world - the only nation in which our government is too ashamed of its own country to allow its own flag to fly.""  But the executive insisted that the ""guidance"" was being changed as part of a review that was already taking place even before Monday's disclosure.  A spokesman said: ""The first minister and deputy first minister believe that public buildings should fly the Saltire on St Andrew's Day, and they will make it clear in the review.""  ""The executive will also actively encourage the flying of the Saltire on public buildings on St Andrew's Day.""  The ban arose from guidance issued by the government's Department of Culture, Media and Sport.  Historic Scotland said: ""We are required, in common with all other government buildings in Scotland, and in line with Scottish ministers' policy, to fly the Union flag on 'special' days.  ""Where there is one flagpole, the union flag is flown.  ""Where there are two flagpoles, the Union Flag and the house flag are flown."""
162,"Hanukkah or Chanukah is the Jewish Festival of Lights.  It dates back to two centuries before the beginning of Christianity.  In the western calendar Hanukkah is celebrated in November or December.  The word Hanukkah means rededication and celebrates one of the greatest miracles in Jewish history.  The festival reminds Jews of a time over 2500 years ago when Antiochus, a Syrian king, tried to make the Jewish people worship Greek gods. A statue of Antiochus was erected in the Jewish temple and the Jews were ordered to bow down before him. The Ten Commandments forbid Jews to worship statues or idols and so they refused.  A small group of Jews called Maccabees rebelled, and after a three year war they recaptured Jerusalem from the Syrians. But the temple was all but destroyed.  The Jews had to clean and repair the Temple, and when they were finished they rededicated it to God. They did this by lighting the lamp (Menorah) - which was a symbol of God's presence. Only one small jar of oil was found, enough for one day, but miraculously the lamp stayed alight for eight days.  Hanukkah is celebrated by lighting one candle on the Hanukiah (an eight-stemmed candelabrum) each day.  The Hanukiah symbolises how God looked after the Jewish people at this difficult time.  Games are often played at Hanukkah. The most common game uses a dreidel and is a popular way of helping children to remember the great miracle."
163,"I've lived in Brixton for five years and it's really changed in the past 10 months.  My road used to be a crack area and then got cleaned up. I could walk around even at 3am with never any trouble.  But in the past year I've been mugged, my friends have been mugged and two of the shops I go to have been held up.  The guy who runs my local off-licence got done over by eight guys with guns; and the owner of the organic foods shop has spent about £1,000 on extra security since he was robbed.  I would tie this in with the relaxation of the law on possession. The papers go on about crime falling but that's just ridiculous.  Some days there's up to three dealers on each street corner; while some are quite sweet, others can be heavy handed. One guy threatened to cut me up if I didn't buy off him.  People have always smoked cannabis in Brixton - everyone knows that, people have walked down the street smoking spliffs for years.  But now the word has spread around that it's legal in Lambeth - even though it's not - we get people new to London coming here looking to score.  If I walk down Landor Rd or Coldharbour Lane, every 200 yards I'll be asked if I want dope, if I want skunk. I say: 'Sorry, I've gone off that stuff,' but still they hassle me. I'm fed up with being approached and hassled all the time. That's why I organised a petition of local residents, calling for CCTV and more police on the beat. Click here to see what others have to say  I e-mailed it to my local MP, and all of sudden we were organising an emergency meeting to discuss the rising crime in the area.  People from all walks of life were there, representing the mix of people who live in Brixton: housewives, people with really good jobs, artists, music types, local shop owners, a couple of people from the housing estate.  We've since handed the petition in, having collected more than 600 signatures, but not much has changed yet.  I was happy when Brian Paddick went [the police commander who introduced the ""softly softly"" scheme and was later moved from his post while allegations about his private life were investigated].  He meant well but the police should have just kept shut about their plans to stop arresting people with small amounts of cannabis. They wanted to cut the amount of time filling in forms - so just do it, don't tell the whole world so that people start thinking it's legal.  I think they should have either legalised cannabis or left the law alone.  I used to really like the vibe in Brixton but now I can't wait to get out. My wife and I could put our flat on the market, but with house prices shooting up we could only afford to buy a house in another dodgy area.  Real Time gives people a chance to tell their own stories in their own words. If you've got something to say, click here. Some of your comments so far: I am 15 years old and I am so angry at what is going on in Lambeth. You can't expect to just downgrade cannabis, it's making things easier for other dealers. The majority of teenagers accept cannabis as just another social drug, like alcohol. This is why it should be legalised, before a whole bunch of teenagers start getting onto heavier drugs because these are thrown in our faces on the streets, when we only want to get hold of a bit of dope.   Craig, England The people that come to Lambeth for cannabis are very different to the crack dealers, addicts and pimps behind the current rise in often violent crime. We had a crack house on the road I used to live on. That was shut down, but there are now three more and residents are often too scared to go outside as the dealers openly prowl the street. Brixton is a wonderful community so lets not make things worse by missing the real issue.   Sophie, UK This is the problem of trying to do this as a pilot in such a small area: you get an influx from areas where the laws are more strictly enforced. Presumably we will now be told that this policy has failed, and real discussion of the drug laws will yet again be waved off.   John, UK Why do we talk about the legalities when we should really be talking about attitude to drugs and the unknown dangers of them? Come on, we are endorsing a nation to start frying its brains.   Jason Christie, UK Giving warnings then confiscating cannabis frees up the police to concentrate on serious issues like crack dealing and robbery. A few more drug tourists buying (mainly bogus drugs) is a small price to pay for better policing.   Christian Evans, England I've lived in Brixton since the late '80s when it was a more dangerous and rundown area. People have always hassled passers-by to sell them dope (more likely oregano) and there has been no discernable increase since the softly softly approach on cannabis. I'd rather put up with a few misinformed dope tourists than a greater incidence of crack dealing, which would be the effect of returning to the waste in police resources represented by targeting a few harmless potheads.   Ade, UK Selling drugs to ""a few harmless potheads"" is innocuous enough. But there are two forms of crime that always accompany it: competition between those selling it, which leads to violent ""turf wars""; and the thieving that SOME of the user community undertake to fund their habit.   Tony Armour, UK I was brought up in the Easterhouse during the late 70s and early 80s when heroin was rampant. Mothers tried all they could to help their kids, but had minimal support from the government or police. These days there is so much information to help you tackle the problem. I'm not sure if today's government is on the right track with the softly softly approach. But I am sure that we should shift our focus to crack cocaine - how many pot-heads do you know with a gun?  David Watson, Scotland I don't think the relaxed approach to cannabis has been implemented the right way. Coldharbour Lane and Loughborough Junction attract more dodgy characters and I feel uncomfortable walking around there. The changes should have been more drastic, regulating the sale of cannabis through licensed shops so dealers with other drugs to sell are not attracted to the area.   Yolanda, UK I used to think that the UK should decriminalise cannabis, but now I have changed my mind. There are parts of Amsterdam where you can't walk down the street without people hassling you to buy crack/coke/E/whatever. The only sensible way forward is to legalise it, to have it regulated and taxed by the government and sold in shops, thereby taking the dealers of other substances out of the cannabis market.   Phil, UK These things take time to show their real effects - the relaxing of laws in Holland, coupled with real education about drugs, has led from the average age of a heroin addict [rising] from 14 to the age of 40.

164,"Timing and tone have never been Al Gore's forte.  Remember the lingering kiss of the 2000 race?  His wife Tipper looked less like the adored First Lady-in-waiting and more like the unfortunate victim of an alien suction attack.  The kiss, which displayed all the spontaneous passion of the campaign focus group that had ordained it, failed to tip Tennessee and Florida in Mr Gore's favour.  Then there were his ructions at the presidential debates.  Yes, the irascible vice-president had a firm grasp of every wonky policy detail, but George W Bush had the charm. The rest is history.  Compare the glutinous Mr Gore of seven years ago to the slick Al who melted the hearts of Hollywood at Sunday's Oscar ceremony.  For those who missed it, the former vice-president mounted the stage with Leonardo DiCaprio to present an award.  Green Oscars? Are the famous statuettes now made of alfalfa and wheat germ?  But then Al and Leo got down to their double act.  ""Now"", Leo said, ""are you sure, are you positive that all this hard work hasn't inspired you to make another kind of major, major announcement to the world here tonight?""  ""Well, I do appreciate that, Leo,"" the former vice-president replied dead-pan, pulling a sheet of paper out of his breast pocket with perfect timing.  ""And I'm kind of surprised at the feelings welling up here... and I guess with a billion people watching it's as good a time as any - so, my fellow Americans, I'm going to take this opportunity right here and now to formally announce my intention...""  At that precise point the Oscar anthem - whose volume is always yanked up when a winner has droned on for more than the allotted 30 seconds - drowned out Al Gore.  Timing and tone were pitch-perfect. The audience erupted in laughter.  It was Al Gore's most high-profile funny moment since 2000, but not his first.  By all accounts it hasn't all been one long joke since the Florida recount.  First came the depression. Then came the full beard. Then the snacks.  He may be a few pounds heavier than he was in 2000 but he seems much lighter on his feet.  Here is clearly a man who has been liberated by failure.  And America loves a tale of redemption told by a famous person.  By the way the fact that George W Bush used to be an alcoholic never bothered even his most puritanical supporters.  In fact throwing out Johnny Walker and embracing Jesus Christ has always spoken for him. It shows strength of character.  And so does Al Gore's resurrection.  The writer Gore Vidal, who says he is related to the former vice-president, once told me that the young Al was funny, sensitive and had a passion - and talent - for painting.  It was his ambitious father, the late Senator Albert Gore Sr, who pushed young Al into politics and forced him to forsake a more frivolous and creative calling.  Well, the combination of former statesman and stand-up comedian suits him perfectly.  The big question still bouncing round the Beltway is whether Al meant what he said.  If he did eventually decide to run in 2008, he would certainly not need to remind people who he was.  Half the audience in LA's Kodak theatre would surely reach into their pockets to support the presidential bid of a man who has taken Hollywood's fears about climate change to a higher level.  And although the greening of Al will not sway Texas or even Tennessee, it could certainly impress storm-ravaged Florida.  A combination of high petrol prices, instability in the Middle East and the devastation of a Hurricane called Katrina have made millions of Americans think more carefully about the planet they inhabit and the resources they pillage.  Moreover, Al Gore doesn't need to get in a twist about the Iraq war.  He was publicly against it when almost everyone else was still for it.  He may be less exciting than Barack Obama, but he has a lot more experience.  He may not possess the Hillary Clinton machine but, curiously, he appears a lot fresher than the senator from New York.  A race between the two of them for the Democratic nomination really would turn the 2008 election into the Antiques Roadshow - the former First Lady versus the former vice-president!  You really couldn't make it up.  But while Hollywood may love sequels, the audience tires easily of them. That too is an inconvenient truth!

165,"Parents of pupils at a London school have called for an investigation into claims that their children have been restrained without their knowledge.  Footage filmed inside the Harris Primary Academy Coleraine Park, in Tottenham, shows pupils being restrained by staff.  Haringey Council said it was investigating the incidents.  An academy spokesperson said the use of restraint was ""very rare, but sometimes necessary"".  Footage, which was filmed in July by a former staff member, appears to show a pupil being restrained in the playground by three members of staff and on another occasion a child being led along a corridor by two people.  Sofia, the mother of one of the boys restrained in the footage, has called for the schools watchdog Ofsted to intervene.  ""This happened last year... and I have only just recently found out about it and I am angry,"" she said.  ""I've got tears in my eyes because it pains me to see someone manhandling my child like that. It's not right.""  A Haringey Council spokesperson said: ""As would be expected, once we received and reviewed the footage we acted in line with best practice by making Ofsted and the police aware of it.  ""We are now conducting our own investigation and will work with the academy, as we would with any Haringey school, to ensure that the welfare of pupils is being managed appropriately.""  A spokesperson for the Harris Primary Academy Coleraine Park said: ""The use of restraint is very rare, but sometimes necessary for pupils with serious behavioural issues. It is only ever used if they are posing an immediate physical danger to themselves or to other children.  ""All staff involved had been trained in how to safely restrain pupils in line with government guidelines. Just as a parent would want to be reassured that restraint is only used when necessary, they would equally want to know that their child would be kept safe from another pupil's violent outburst.  ""We believe all young children can learn to behave well so it is our policy not to permanently exclude primary school pupils. Therefore, as was the case with these incidents, preventing them from hurting other children means they have a second chance to stay in mainstream education and thrive.""  The Department of Education advises that reasonable force can be used to prevent pupils from hurting themselves or others, and it is good practice for schools to speak to parents and to consider how to record serious incidents.  Ofsted said it was not currently conducting an investigation into the academy.  In a statement, the watchdog said: ""As a new academy, the school will be inspected in due course in accordance with our inspection selection policy, which is available on our website.  ""It would be inappropriate to comment about any specific complaints as the outcomes of complaints investigations can be taken forward to the school's next inspection."""
166,"     For the first time, the key players in the tense confrontation between Nato and Russian troops talk about the stand-off which jeopardised the entire peacekeeping mission.      The Russians, who played a crucial role in persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the war, had expected to police their own sector of Kosovo, independent of Nato.      When they did not get it, they felt double-crossed.      As Nato's K-For peacekeepers prepared to enter the province on 12 June, they discovered the Russians had got there first.      A contingent of 200 troops, stationed in Bosnia, was already rolling towards Pristina airport.      'Third World War'      General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, immediately ordered 500 British and French paratroopers to be put on standby to occupy the airport.      ''I called the [Nato] Secretary General [Javier Solana] and told him what the circumstances were,'' General Clark tells the BBC programme Moral Combat: Nato at War.      ''He talked about what the risks were and what might happen if the Russian's got there first, and he said: 'Of course you have to get to the airport'.    ''I said: 'Do you consider I have the authority to do so?' He said: 'Of course you do, you have transfer of authority'.''      But General Clark's plan was blocked by General Sir Mike Jackson, K-For's British commander.      ""I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,"" he reportedly told General Clark during one heated exchange.      General Jackson tells the BBC: ''We were [looking at] a possibility....of confrontation with the Russian contingent which seemed to me probably not the right way to start off a relationship with Russians who were going to become part of my command.''      Russian plans      The Russian advance party took the airport unopposed. The world watched nervously.      A senior Russian officer, General Leonid Ivashev, tells the BBC how the Russians had plans to fly in thousands of troops.      ''Let's just say that we had several airbases ready. We had battalions of paratroopers ready to leave within two hours,'' he said.      Amid fears that Russian aircraft were heading for Pristina, General Clark planned to order British tanks and armoured cars to block the runways to prevent any transport planes from landing.      General Clark said he believed it was ''an appropriate course of action''. But the plan was again vetoed by Britain.      Partition fears      Instead, he asked neighbouring countries, including Hungary and Romania not to allow Russian aircraft to overfly their territory.    During the stand-off, Moscow insisted its troops would be answerable only to its own commanders.      Nato refused to accept this, predicting it would lead to the partition of Kosovo into an ethnic Albanian south and a Serbian north.      A deal on the deployment of Russian peacekeepers was reached in early July.      The Russians now operate as part of K-For in sectors controlled by Nato states, but are not directly under Nato's command.      Moral Combat: Nato at War will be broadcast at 9pm this Sunday on BBC2 Details of Russia's surprise occupation of Pristina airport at the end of the Kosovo war are revealed in a new BBC documentary on the conflict.For the first time, the key players in the tense confrontation between Nato and Russian troops talk about the stand-off which jeopardised the entire peacekeeping mission.The Russians, who played a crucial role in persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the war, had expected to police their own sector of Kosovo, independent of Nato.When they did not get it, they felt double-crossed.As Nato's K-For peacekeepers prepared to enter the province on 12 June, they discovered the Russians had got there first.A contingent of 200 troops, stationed in Bosnia, was already rolling towards Pristina airport.General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, immediately ordered 500 British and French paratroopers to be put on standby to occupy the airport.''I called the [Nato] Secretary General [Javier Solana] and told him what the circumstances were,'' General Clark tells the BBC programme Moral Combat: Nato at War.''He talked about what the risks were and what might happen if the Russian's got there first, and he said: 'Of course you have to get to the airport'."
167,"Failing that, you might be a False-start Florence. Or just a Zebedee.  Whatever your behaviour when you drive round a British roundabout, a group of roundabout enthusiasts have a name for you, culled from the characters of the classic Magic Roundabout TV series.  The secretive Roundabout Appreciation Society meets in and around Poole in Dorset. Members get together to discuss roundabout architecture, design, safety features and wildlife.  ""At roundabouts, you have to watch out for different kinds of drivers,"" he says.  ""You've got the False-Start Florences, who inch forward a bit but don't make the decision to pull out completely. The person behind them assumes they are going to go further, so accelerates and goes straight into the back of them.  ""Roundabouts are designed by engineers so that there's a clear view of the traffic coming from the right. It should be easy to see if there's enough time to pull out, or not.""  But the Florences are by no means the only bad characters on our nation's roundabouts. Members of the society have come up with more nicknames.  ""Also there's the Dillons, who drive straight into the middle of a roundabout because they didn't see it coming.""  It all sounds terribly flippant, but Clive and his roundabout-obsessed friends have some serious points to make about the UK's 10,000 roundabouts.  Roundabout-style junctions were first used in France in the 1870s, but Clive says the first recognisable modern roundabout was New York's Columbus Circle, opened in 1905.  There were problems from the start, because people went round it any way they liked. But it remains in place to this day, as Manhattan's only roundabout (""traffic circle"" to our US cousins).  The first roundabout in the UK appeared in the Garden City of Letchworth five years later. It was intended to help pedestrians more than motorists - with cars getting faster and more numerous, too many people were getting stuck in the middle of the road as they tried to cross. Twenty years later, it was decided to make all traffic navigate roundabouts in the same direction.  Traffic circles were considered a disastrous failure in the US, but roundabouts continued to be popular in Europe, especially Britain.  Clive believes this is hardly surprising, because overall, they are safer junctions.  The growth of mini-roundabouts has caused some problems, though, with some drivers ignoring the road markings and driving straight across. The society has something to say about that, too.  ""At our last meeting, some members thought that a small trench should be dug around mini roundabouts to stop people driving over them. People need to slow down and go round roundabouts, even the mini ones,"" Clive says.  Ultimately, all the Roundabout Appreciation Society wants to do is promote safe and considerate driving.  ""We want drivers to be more tolerant when they see visitors and foreign drivers getting in the wrong lane at roundabouts, or pulling out on the wrong side of the road,"" says Clive.  So how does an enthusiast tell the difference between a good roundabout and a bad one?  The secret lies in how well it's maintained. A shabby roundabout is a poor reflection on local people and local pride, according to Clive.  ""There are some beautiful roundabouts with sculptures, flower beds or interesting plants. Anything that makes the drivers slow down at junctions is a good thing.  ""Some roundabouts are very cleverly designed. There's foliage in the centre but it has gaps in it so that drivers can see through to the other side. Their eyes take in the plants, but also the oncoming traffic. Drivers don't realise it, but they can be controlled in this way by the roundabout designers.""  The society members take their roundabouts very seriously, but their thoughts have recently turned to other aspects of road safety, especially that of pedestrians.  ""These days, roundabouts have put the motorist at the top of the tree. Pedestrians don't seem to be so important anymore. We're thinking of starting up the Zebra Crossing Protection Society, because they seem to be disappearing too."""
168,"The BBC's David Willis said her performance would ""go down in the history books as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards"".  Her ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake and R&B star Rihanna were the big winners.  Timberlake took four awards, including top male artist, while Rihanna scooped video of the year for Umbrella.  Spears, who was not nominated for any awards, opened the show dressed in a sequinned bikini and knee-high boots, performing her new single Gimme More.  Our correspondent said the performance would hit the headlines ""for all the wrong reasons"".  The singer looked ""really out of sorts"" and ""looked as though she completely lost the art of lip-synching"", he said.  Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton said: ""She blew it. Everybody knows Britney lip-synchs, but that's because she dances so much.  ""She barely even danced in this. It was so bad. It was painful. It was embarrassing. And I loved it!""  ""She seemed nervous... you could tell by the expression on her face,"" he said.  ""Instead of just blocking everybody out and doing her thing, you could tell she was thinking about it.""  The performance comes after a year when Spears publicly shaved her head, went into rehab and fought husband Kevin Federline for custody of their two sons.  Rihanna's Umbrella, which spent 10 weeks at number one in the UK, took MTV's single of the year award, beating Beyonce, Timberlake, Kanye West and Amy Winehouse.  Timberlake, who was named best male artist, said: ""It's just exciting to see a new generation of artists really doing it, and doing it well.  ""I think music is in a great place right now because we're all doing what we want to do. So thank you for this award, MTV.""  Fergie was named best female artist, while Beyonce and Shakira took the award for most earth-shattering collaboration for Beautiful Liar.  The best new artist gong went to Gym Class Heroes, and Fall Out Boy were named best group.  Rapper Kanye West threw a tantrum in front of media after missing out on the five awards he was nominated for.  West, who gatecrashed the stage at the MTV Europe Awards after failing to win the prize for best video, said he would never return to MTV.  And there was more drama off-stage when Kid Rock and Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee tussled in the audience.  Both are former husbands of actress and model Pamela Anderson, who was a presenter at the show.  Security officials allowed rapper Kid Rock to stay for the rest of the ceremony while Lee was dragged out.  The incident inspired plenty of mock rebukes from those in the crowd.  ""They say it's only rappers,"" said MTV VJ Sway. ""I told you, rockers fight too."""
169,"Iran Brown, now aged 14, told a court in Virginia Beach how he was shot in the chest on his way to school on 7 October, 2002.  John Allen Muhammad, 42, is accused of shooting the boy and killing 10 people during a three-week sniping spree last year in Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC.  He is on trial for the murder of 53-year-old Dean Meyers at a petrol station in Manassas, Virginia, on 9 October.  Mr Muhammad's alleged accomplice, 18-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, goes on trial separately next month.  Jurors heard how Iran Brown was dropped off by his aunt, Tanya Brown, at Benjamin Tasker Middle School in Bowie, Maryland, on the morning he was shot.  ""I walked out [of the car] and I put my bookbag down and I got shot,"" he said, in a calm, clear voice.  His aunt rushed him to hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery.  The boy suffered injuries to many of his major organs and was in hospital for several weeks.  Iran Brown told the court the shooting had ""brought me closer to God"".  Tanya Brown, a nurse, said she heard a loud noise followed by Iran calling for help.  ""He told me, 'I've been shot.' I didn't believe him at first,"" she said.  She said she saw a hole in his shorts and what appeared to be a blood stain.  Mr Muhammad has pleaded not guilty to the four charges he faces over Meyers' death - which include two counts of capital murder, one charge of conspiracy and a weapons charge.  His lawyers have argued Mr Malvo did the actual shooting.  But Mr Malvo's lawyers contend that their young client was brainwashed by Mr Muhammad and say he will plead insanity."
170,"For many years, Myra Hindley was depicted by the tabloid press as ""the most hated woman in Britain"".  The crimes committed by Hindley and her lover, Ian Brady, shocked the nation and became the benchmark by which other acts of evil came to be measured.  On 6 May 1966, at Chester Assizes, Hindley and Brady were jailed for life after a 15-day trial.  They were convicted of the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, aged 10, in 1964, and Edward Evans, aged 17, in 1965.  Brady was also convicted of the murder of 12-year-old John Kilbride, and Hindley was found guilty of being an accessory.  Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride were both strangled. Edward Evans was attacked with a hatchet and strangled.  The case was made even more notorious by the tape-recording played to the trial of Lesley Ann Downey pleading for her life.  The killings soon became known as the ""Moors murders"" because the bodies had been buried on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester.  In 1987, Brady and Hindley confessed to two further murders - those of Pauline Reade, aged 16, and 12-year-old Keith Bennett.  Searches conducted on Saddleworth Moor led to the discovery of Pauline Reade's body, but Keith Bennett's body was never found.  The director of public prosecutions decided a prosecution of the two cases would not be in the public interest.  Hindley was born in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, in 1942.  Years later she spoke of the tyrannical violence of her father, Bob, a building labourer.  She left school at 15, learned how to type and within three years went to work at a small chemical firm.  There she met Brady, who was working as a stock clerk.  He had a minor criminal record with stretches in borstals and Strangeways Prison in Manchester.  While inside, he began his fixation with Hitler and the writings of the Marquis de Sade.  Until then, Hindley had been, by all accounts, a perfectly normal girl, with strong religious feelings.  She loved children and animals, and was much in demand as a babysitter.  She was, like most teenage girls, highly romantic, and became infatuated with Brady.  She wrote in her diary: ""I hope he loves me, and will marry me some day.""  When they became lovers, Hindley was prepared to do anything Brady asked.  So in July 1963, he persuaded her to lure 16-year-old Pauline Reade up to the moors.  Pauline was killed, and Hindley helped Brady to bury her body.  In October 1963, the couple drove to the market at Ashton-under-Lyne, where 12-year-old John Kilbride did odd jobs for stallholders.  As it became dark and foggy, Hindley asked him if he wanted a lift. It was the last time he was seen alive.  Brady and Hindley tried to involve other people in their activities, but one of these, Myra's brother-in-law David Smith, eventually caused their capture.  He called the police after he witnessed the murder of Edward Evans.  Ian Brady, now 64, was moved from prison to a high security hospital in 1985.  He has recently called for a public hearing to determine whether he should still be detained in a mental institution.  But he has repeatedly told the BBC he has no desire to be freed, and will never seek parole.  Hindley, however, pursued a long campaign for parole, with the support of the late Lord Longford, who visited her frequently in prison.  In 1998, Appeal Court judges upheld the decision by the former Home Secretary Jack Straw that Hindley should stay in prison until she died, unless there were ""exceptional"" reasons to review the tariff.  They dismissed arguments by her lawyers that Mr Straw and his predecessors had acted unlawfully when they imposed a ""full life tariff"".  At the Appeal Court, Lord Justice Judge said Hindley's 1987 confession had revealed a ""much greater level of involvement"" with Brady than she had previously admitted.  Hindley's supporters argued that she had shown remorse since going to prison, where she became a devout Roman Catholic.  She had obtained an Open University degree in humanities and had become a ""good woman"", they said.  Hindley took her case to the House of Lords in 2000, but again failed, when five law lords ruled unanimously that Mr Straw's decision had been lawful and justified.  Just two days after the original trial, the judge who sentenced Hindley said: ""Though I believe Brady is wicked beyond belief without hope of redemption, I cannot feel that the same is necessarily true of Hindley once she is removed from his influence.""  But in 1994, Hindley wrote that she was ""wicked and evil"" and had behaved ""monstrously"".  She said: ""Without me, those crimes could probably not have been committed.""  Much of the debate about the fate of Myra Hindley focused on her relationship with Brady.  At her trial, evidence was produced that she had been subjected to threats, violence and intimidation by him.  Though Brady and Hindley exchanged love letters in their first years in custody, later he said she was a manipulative liar who was as committed to murder as he had been."
171,"Why TV is the key to Real success  Why do Real Madrid and Barcelona have higher revenues than any English club? The answer lies in the way they sell television rights to their domestic fixtures. Ronaldo's club earn an average of 150m euros a year from TV rights The Spanish system allows them to negotiate their own broadcasting deals. In many other countries the TV deals are negotiated by the league they play in, and the money is distributed according to an agreed formula. As winners of the English Premier League, Manchester United received £52m from the distribution of TV rights in 2008/9. Real Madrid - second in La Liga - earned more than double that amount from its broadcasting contract with Mediapro. According to the sports unit at consultants Deloitte, both Real Madrid and Barcelona have deals with Mediapro until at least 2012/13 which will contribute broadcasting revenues of, on average, approximately 150m euros ($203m; £136m) each year. In England the distribution of TV money is unequal. But it is a lot less unequal than in Spain. The Business of Sport - Football in the Red. It will be broadcast live on Tuesday 2 March (all times GMT) For example, Manchester City, who came tenth in the 2008/9 season received £40m - only £12m less than winners United. And this way of distributing money has helped seven English clubs into Deloitte's list of the 20 highest-earning clubs in the world. Spain has the top two, but no other Spanish club makes the top 20. The attraction of more equal distribution is that it should help produce a more competitive domestic league. So far this season, both Real Madrid and Barcelona have won 19 out of 23 games in La Liga. In England, Chelsea and Manchester United have both won 19 out of 28. So watching an English Premier League game has offered viewers a better chance of watching something other than the routine destruction of less well resourced clubs. With international TV rights becoming an increasingly important source of income and leagues competing for attention around the world, the Spanish model has clear dangers. In the long run, re-distribution of revenues to help the less well supported clubs should produce a more competitive and watchable league. The merits of a more re-distributive system are about to be put to the test. In Italy the clubs are about to move from a system where clubs sell TV rights individually to a more collective arrangement. As the Deloitte Sports Unit warns in its annual report on football finance, that may pose problems for clubs like Juventus. Its 28,000-seat stadium is a third of the size of some of the other big European clubs. And with that limit on ticket sales, Juve gets almost two thirds of its total revenue from its lucrative domestic television deal. A more even distribution of Italian TV revenues is an obvious threat. But the argument is that making collective arrangements will increase total revenues and make Serie A into a stronger league. As most football fans now know, it is the business arrangements behind the scenes which often drive what happens on the field. And very often, TV is the key.     "
172,"Flights have resumed at London's Heathrow Airport after a fire on a parked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet.  All runways were closed for nearly 90 minutes after the fire at 16:30 BST. No passengers were aboard the plane at the time, a Heathrow spokesman said.  Fifty Dreamliners worldwide were grounded in January after malfunctions with the plane's lithium-ion batteries.  Boeing modified the jets with new batteries and flights resumed in April.  The Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the Department for Transport has despatched a team to the scene.  The Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner in the Heathrow incident - named the Queen of Sheba - flew from Addis Ababa to Nairobi on the first commercial flight since the grounding.  Pictures of the Heathrow fire showed the Queen of Sheba close to a building and surrounded by fire vehicles. London Fire Brigade said its crews assisted Heathrow staff.  Fire-retardant foam was sprayed at the airliner, and an area on top of the fuselage in front of the tail appeared to be scorched.  Ethiopian Airlines said smoke was detected from the aircraft after it had been parked at Heathrow for more than eight hours.  A Heathrow spokesman said: ""Heathrow's runways are now fully open following an earlier fire on board an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft which the airport's emergency services attended.  ""The aircraft was parked on a remote parking stand and there were no passengers on board. Arrivals and departures were temporarily suspended while airport fire crews attended to this incident.  ""This is a standard procedure if fire crews are occupied with an incident.""  Heathrow reopened shortly before 18:00 BST but was advising passengers to check the status of their flights with the airlines.  Gatwick Airport said it experienced minor delays on departing flights as it assisted Heathrow with flights that were diverted.  Meanwhile, Thomson Airways said one of its Dreamliners travelling to Florida returned to Manchester Airport as a precautionary measure, not connected to the Heathrow fire.  Thomson, which became the first British carrier to operate the aircraft earlier this week, and is taking delivery of eight of the planes, said the plane had ""experienced a technical issue"".  British Airways is taking delivery of the first two of its 24 Dreamliners.  Virgin Atlantic said it ""remains committed"" to taking on the first of its 16 Dreamliners in September 2014.  The British pilots' union Balpa said: ""The Boeing 787 Dreamliner forms an important part of many of our airlines' future plans, and it is vital that the cause of this fire is established as quickly as possible.  ""All parties in the industry need a full and transparent explanation as to what has been identified as the root causes in this series of events.""  The battery problems followed production difficulties for the Dreamliner, marketed as a quiet, fuel-efficient aircraft carrying between 201 and 290 passengers on medium-range routes.  It was due to enter passenger service in 2008 but it was not until October 2011 that the first commercial flight was operated by Japan's All Nippon Airways.  The groundings of all Dreamliners in service in January followed two major incidents concerning the plane's two lithium-ion batteries.  On 7 January, a battery overheated and started a fire on a Japan Airlines 787 at Boston's Logan International Airport. Nine days later, an All Nippon Airways 787 had to make an emergency landing in Japan after a battery started to give off smoke.  The two batteries are not used when the 787 is in flight.  They are operational when the plane is on the ground and its engines are not turned on, and are used to power the aircraft's brakes and lights.  The new versions of the batteries, which run at a much cooler temperature, are now enclosed in stainless steel boxes.  Boeing shares fell on the New York Stock Exchange on news of the fire.  A Boeing spokesman said: ""We're aware of the event. We have Boeing personnel on the ground at Heathrow and are working to fully understand and address this."""
173,"By Daniel Schweimler in Madrid Spain is still celebrating the victory of Pedro Almodovar's film ""All About My Mother"" at the Oscar awards. But during those festivities there was another significant development in Spanish cinema with the release across the country of the film, Yoyes. Yoyes was the codename of Dolores Gonzalez Catarain - one of the most senior women in the Basque separatist movement ETA. Who are the Basques? The film covers Yoyes' early days with the separatist movement, how she took over leadership of its political wing in France and then - disillusioned after a particularly bloody attack on a Madrid cafe - left ETA and went into exile in Mexico. While there she underwent a change. She studied, had a child and radically altered her political views. She went back to Spain in the early 1980s after the country had returned to democracy but in 1986 was killed in a crowded marketplace by a former ETA colleague who saw her as a traitor. The subject of ETA has always been a sensitive one in Spain, but never more so than now, following the breakdown of the movement's 14-month ceasefire and its recent return to violence.       Most Spanish film directors have previously skirted around the issue of ETA and its violent 30-year campaign for an independent homeland in which more than 800 people have been killed. But the director of Yoyes, Helena Taberna, has tackled the issue full on and so far won glowing praise from many Spanish film critics. One says that the human side of an ETA member has been tackled for the first time. Another that all those who value freedom should value Ms Taberna's film. Ms Taberna herself says Yoyes is not a documentary but a fictional film based on true events. She calls it a contemporary tragedy - one woman's story based on her right to change and on the times she lived in. Ms Taberna is from the northern city of Pamplona in the region of Navarra, which neighbours the Basque region and has often been involved in the conflict. She said at first it was difficult to get funding for her work, an Italian, French and Spanish co-production, but did eventually receive help from the Basque regional government. The film was made during ETA's ceasefire when there was widespread optimism that a permanent end to the Basque conflict could be negotiated. Those hopes were dashed with two bomb attacks, which left three people dead, earlier this year. These events mean that many ordinary Spaniards will now view Yoyes very differently to how they might have done just a few months ago."
174,"Police forces around the UK could benefit from a system that can detect accidental 999 calls from mobile phones.  The system, called Silent Solutions, has been used by the Metropolitan Police for almost a year to screen out such calls made in London.  More than two million silent calls have been successfully dealt with and £3 million saved thanks to the new system.  Nearly half of all emergency calls made from mobiles are accidental and it has caused a huge headache for police and other emergency services.  All silent calls, where the caller does not specify the emergency service they require, are automatically forwarded to local police forces.  Under the Silent Solutions system, all silent calls received by the 999 switchboard are automatically forwarded to an automated service.  The service plays a recorded message informing the caller that they have been connected to the police at New Scotland Yard.  The message informs the caller that if they require either the police, ambulance, fire brigade or another emergency service they must press the number five on their keypad twice.  If this action is taken the call will be reconnected as a priority to an operator but in the vast majority of cases there is no response and the line is disconnected.  All of the calls are recorded.  ""It's a very important facility to have especially at the Met which has to deal with an enormous number of calls and needs something sophisticated,"" said a spokesperson for ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers).  ""So many false calls are made without the user knowing,"" he added.  The growth of mobile phone use has had a dramatic impact on call handling.  In order to cope with the increase in calls, the Metropolitan Police is receiving £140m of government money to overhaul its 999 call centres, reports Computing magazine.  The aim of the project is to improve the processes behind the 999 service as the number of calls increases.  The central communications information room at New Scotland Yard receives an average of 8,500 emergency calls each day.  Silent Solutions has intercepted around 2,000 calls a day, freeing up valuable police resources to deal with real emergencies.  Since introducing the system, the number of calls answered within 15 seconds has risen from 53% to over 88%.  The majority of accidental emergency calls are made through the knocking of the mobile phone keypad when it is in a bag or pocket.  A European Union directive makes it mandatory for owners to still be able to dial an emergency service even when the keypad on a mobile phone is locked."
175,"It is not surprising that Malad, in the US state of Idaho, lays claim to having more people of Welsh descent per capita than anywhere outside of Wales.  Renewed interest in ancestry led the town to stage its first Welsh festival since World War One in early July.  Links with Carmarthen are also being made with a view to twinning the towns.  The aim is to develop the Malad Welsh Festival, which revived a once annual event, into a major cultural celebration in the American mid-west, possibly even an eisteddfod.  Lions clubs from both towns are behind the links, which it is hoped will one day lead to official twinning.  Founded in 1865, Malad was a popular destination for Mormon emigrants from Wales seeking a new life for themselves on the other side of the Atlantic.  The early pioneers would have moved west in wagon trains and handcart companies to the Malad Valley, which locals say would have been similar in look and climate to Wales.  President of the Carmarthen club, Roger Love, said ties were formed earlier this year when American Joe Thomas travelled to Wales on business and met some of the members.  He said it was fascinating that there were so many people of Welsh descent all in one small community.  ""He wanted to talk to us not just as a Lions club but as a country,"" he said.  ""The hope is that we will now twin - hopefully as a town but if not as Lions clubs.  ""The idea is to liaise back and fore - even possibly send out representatives to next year's festival.""  Jean Thomas, a member of the Malad Valley Welsh Society which organised the event, said it was a link they were keen to build on.  She said this year's two-day festival included Welsh language workshops, music, dance and talent competitions along with crafts, food and family history displays.  ""We estimated that over 800 people from all over southern Idaho and northern Utah attended,"" she said.  ""This year's success confirms out thoughts that there is a deep interest in Wales and all things Welsh, especially among us who claim a Welsh heritage.""  Malad was founded in 1865 and today has a population of just over 2,000.  Like Carmarthen, agriculture is important to the local economy.  ""The valley is surrounded by mountains, which may have reminded the early Welsh settlers of their native land,"" added Mrs Thomas.  ""I know a lot of people in Malad are anxious to visit Wales.  ""Eventually we want to award tickets to Wales as a top prize for our eisteddfod."""
176,"Network Rail has been fined £1m after admitting health and safety breaches over the deaths of two girls at an Essex level crossing.  Friends Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, were hit by a train in December 2005 as they crossed the railway line at Elsenham station and died instantly.  The company pleaded guilty to three offences at Chelmsford Crown Court.  A series of risk assessments had been carried out at the site, which highlighted the dangers of the crossing. A Network Rail report from 2002 had recommended new gates that locked automatically as trains approached but they had not been fitted.  Olivia's father Chris Bazlinton said: ""The process of justice has been done and they have been fined £1m - it is nothing more than symbolic.  ""I still think we have got to go on and ask who knew what and when? I want something to be done about it.  ""I believe there was a cover up. Why did the three most important documents (in the case) only turn up in the last 12 months?""  Hilary Thompson, Charlotte's mother, said: ""They took our daughters from us and they broke our hearts.""  Charlotte's father, Reg Thompson, added: ""What Network Rail have promised to do today in court, which is to spend £130m on improving safety on level crossings, and the changes that they have already made, have come about because of the terrible thing that happened to our daughters.""  Judge Turner accused Network Rail of ""corporate blindness"". He said: ""The company unreservedly apologises for its failures which contributed to the deaths of these young girls.  ""Network Rail, in part by itself and in part through its predecessor Railtrack, failed to ensure that the risks were properly assessed, controlled or managed.  ""The company concedes that the procedures or standards in place for conducting level crossing risk assessments before 2005 were deficient.""  Following the sentence Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins said: ""On behalf of Network Rail I apologise for the mistakes made by us in this tragic case that contributed to the deaths of Olivia and Charlotte.  ""Nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by Olivia and Charlotte's families but I have promised the families that we will make level crossings safer, and we will deliver on that promise.  ""Fundamental changes to the way we manage and look after the country's 6,500 level crossings have, and are being made.  ""In recent years we have reassessed all of our crossings and closed over 500. There is still much to do and we are committed to doing what is necessary to improve our level crossings.""  The mothers of the girls sat next to each other in court cradling old teddy bears.  They listened as prosecutor Jonathan Ashley-Norman described the moments leading up to the incident on 3 December 2005.  Mr Ashley-Norman said: ""This is as tragic a case as any to reach the criminal courts.""  The court was told the girls were looking forward to a day out together in Cambridge when tragedy struck.  Mr Ashley-Norman said: ""While the lights were still flashing, but plainly believing themselves safe to cross, they stepped across the track and directly into the path of the train heading in the opposite direction.  The girls died as they crossed the footpath leading to Elsenham station platform. The crossing was fitted with warning lights and yodel alarms.  A London to Cambridge train passed over the crossing with the red lights and yodel sounding - a warning for foot passengers not to cross.  After the train passed, the lights remained on and the alarms continued to sound as another train, travelling from Birmingham to Stansted Airport in Essex, was going to pass through the station.  The girls opened the unlocked wicket gates and walked on to the crossing. They were both struck by the Stansted train and killed.  In January, Network Rail, the authority responsible for the UK's railway network, admitted breaching health and safety laws at the level crossing.  Mr Ashley-Norman told the court the lateness of the prosecution came as a result of ""serious flaws in the disclosure process"" from Network Rail.  Key risk assessment documents did not come to light until the bereaved families pursued civil action against the authority, he said.  ""Once the full chronology was revealed, serious failures in the approach to the assessment of risk at Elsenham were exposed,"" he said.  Mr Ashley-Norman told the court about a series of risk assessments that were performed by the company in the years leading up to the accident.  One which was conducted in May 2001 called the wicket-gate pedestrian crossing ""undesirably risky"".  The assessment, conducted by John Hudd, East Anglia level crossings manager for Network Rail, reads: ""I have quite serious reservations about the arrangements which are in place for pedestrians.  ""The combination of free pedestrian wickets adjacent to locked vehicular gates with a crossing keeper on hand is not very comprehensible to the layman (or me!).  ""What makes the whole thing I believe undesirable risky is the large numbers of users (which includes a lot of schoolchildren)."""
177,"A row over sexually explicit content on the web encyclopaedia Wikipedia and related sites has escalated.  Co-founder Jimmy Wales has given up some of his site privileges following protests by contributors angered that he deleted images without consultation.  Mr Wales had previously urged the removal of ""pornographic"" content from the user-generated site.  This followed a complaint about ""child pornography"" to the FBI from another Wikipedia co-founder.  In early April, the estranged co-founder, Larry Sanger, reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI, alleging that the organisation was ""knowingly distributing child pornography"".  He later clarified that his concern was not about photographs of children, but ""obscene visual representations of the abuse of children"", which can include drawings and sculpture.  Last week, administrators of Wikimedia Commons, a media file store widely used for Wikipedia articles, deleted hundreds of images.  Some images deemed by the Wikipedia community to have educational merit have since been reinstated.  Mr Wales had earlier posted his support for the removal of ""images that are of little or no educational value but which appeal solely to prurient interests"", deleting many pictures himself.  Pressure on the organisation had increased after Fox News reported the story, contacting a number of high-profile corporate donors to the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and related sites.  It asked whether the donors were aware of ""the extent of sexually explicit content"" on Wikimedia Commons.  It is not clear whether Mr Wales's support for the removal of explicit content was in response to Mr Sanger's concerns, pressure from Fox News, or something else.  But Michael Peel, Chair of Wikimedia UK, told BBC News that a continuous debate over explicit content has recently ""come to a head"". The central issue at the moment, he says, is ""whether the content is educational"".  ""Anyone can come to Wikimedia Commons and upload media. Illegal stuff is deleted, and copyright stuff is deleted.""  Mr Wales has faced criticism from the band of volunteers who help to maintain the site, some of whom argued that the decision to delete was undemocratic and taken too quickly. They also expressed concerns that valid material might be deleted accidentally.  On Sunday, in response, Jimmy Wales voluntarily revoked many of the ""permissions"" given to him as Wikipedia's founder, to delete and edit ""protected"" content on Wikimedia Commons.  In a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing list he said this was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".  A more detailed policy statement from the Wikimedia Foundation is expected in the coming days."
178,"""I can't have you leaving here hungry,"" she says. ""Here, just have this bowl of soup, and maybe later you'll feel like having a sandwich, or a cup of tea and a piece of cake.""  The hospitable 87-year-old cannot bear the thought of her guest being less than full, but then she has a horror of going hungry.  Seventy-five years ago, Ekaterina saw seven members of her family and almost all of her neighbours starve to death, in a man-made famine that killed millions of people in Ukraine.  The ""Holodomor"" or ""famine plague"" as it is known in Ukraine, was part of Joseph Stalin's programme to crush the resistance of the peasantry to the collectivisation of farming.  When in 1932 the grain harvest did not meet the Kremlin's targets, activists were sent to the villages where they confiscated not just grain and bread, but all the food they could find.  The confiscations continued into 1933, and the results were devastating. No-one is sure how many people died, but historians say that in under a year at least three million and possibly up to 10 million starved to death.  The horrors Ekaterina saw live with her still.  ""We didn't have any funerals - whole families died,"" she tells me.  ""Of our neighbours I remember all the Solveiki family died, all of the Kapshuks, all the Rahachenkos too - and the Yeremo family - three of them, still alive, were thrown into the mass grave.""  Ekaterina, her mother and brother, survived by eating tree bark, roots and whatever they could find - but she says starvation drove others to terrible deeds.  ""One day mother said to us, 'children, you can't take your usual shortcut through the village anymore because the grandpa in the house nearby killed his grandson and ate him - and now he's been killed by his son...  And don't go near the priest's house either - because the neighbours there have killed and eaten their children.'""  Though some, like Ekaterina, can never forget what happened, many Ukrainians had never heard of the famine until the country's independence - such was the secrecy about it during Soviet times.  But every year since independence, events to commemorate the famine get larger, and momentum is growing behind a campaign to raise international awareness of what happened.  This weekend marks the 75th anniversary of the start of the Holodomor, and Ukraine is starting a year of commemorations.  Events are being held across the country. And around the world members of the Ukrainian diaspora are also marking the anniversary.  Ukraine has officially declared the Holodomor a genocide - it says the famine was part of a campaign to crush Ukrainian nationalism.  Ukraine's borders were sealed during the famine, say scholars, to ensure the subjugation of the whole country.  It is a message Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko wants to take to the world.  This anniversary is being used to boost a campaign for other countries, and the United Nations, to officially declare the Holodomor a genocide, too.  But Russia objects. The Russians are accusing Ukraine of using the tragedy of the past to gain political advantage.  The famine could not be genocide, they say, because there was starvation in many parts of the Soviet Union at the time and, they add, for the Ukrainians to claim it was aimed at them is an insult to those of other nationalities who died.  Within Ukraine there is division too.  The head of the country's Communist Party, Pyotr Simonenko, does not believe there was any deliberate starvation at all, and he accuses President Yushchenko of using the famine to stir up hatred.  ""He draws people's attention to history so as not to answer questions about the problems of today - he speaks of the dead, not thinking of the living,"" he says.  ""His insistence that this be recognised as a genocide - which is by the way, an idea with no foundation - will only lead to someone using it in the future to ignite inter-ethnic conflict.""  Though few in Ukraine share Mr Simonenko's interpretation of history, there is some sympathy with his view that the commemoration has been politicised, and that the campaign could damage relations with Russia.  None of this, however, is deterring President Yushchenko. He says he wants a new law criminalising Holodomor denial - and to see new monuments to the famine built in Ukraine before the end of the year's commemorations.  It remains to be seen whether those monuments will bring Ukrainians together in remembrance, or divide them along political lines."

181,"The Periodic Table will be one element longer Discovered 13 years ago, and officially added to the periodic table just weeks ago, element 112 finally has a name. It will be called ""copernicium"", with the symbol Cn, in honour of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus deduced that the planets revolved around the Sun, and finally refuted the belief that the Earth was the centre of the Universe. The team of scientists who discovered the element chose the name to honour the man who ""changed our world view"". The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) will officially endorse the new element's name in six months' time in order to give the scientific community ""time to discuss the suggestion"". Scientists from the Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany, led by Professor Sigurd Hofmann, discovered copernicium in fusion experiments in 1996. ""After IUPAC officially recognised our discovery, we agreed on proposing the name (because) we would like to honour an outstanding scientist,"" said Professor Hofmann. Copernicus was born 1473 in Torun, Poland. His finding that the planets circle the sun underpins much of modern science. It was pivotal for the discovery of gravity, and led to the conclusion that the stars are incredibly far away and that the Universe is inconceivably large. Under IUPAC rules, the team were not allowed to name the element after a living person. But when asked if, rules aside, he would have liked to have ""hofmanium"" added to the periodic table, Professor Hofmann told BBC News: ""No, I think copernicium sounds much better.""     "
182,"US publishing giant Time Warner and UK music group EMI have ditched their $20bn merger plans, after last minute concessions failed to meet watchdogs' concerns.  The two companies on Thursday withdrew their application to the European Commission for permission to merge their music arms, stating they wanted more time to tackle objections to the tie-up.  EC competition officials were concerned that the tie-up between EMI and Time Warner's Warner Music subsidiary would have placed 80% of Europe's recorded music business in the hands of just four global giants.  The companies proposed selling record labels, music catalogues and distribution networks to meet the commission's concerns, and even considered selling off Virgin Records and Chappell Music, in an effort to meet the concerns.  But the EC said on Thursday that the concessions represented a ""substantial"" improvement, it ""still had doubts, and in view of the late stage of the procedures, could not properly evaluate the undertakings"".  Eric Nicoli, EMI chairman, said: ""The withdrawal allows additional time to reassess regulators' concerns and to pursue solutions simultaneously in Europe and the US.  ""We have been and will continue to be flexible in responding to the EC's concerns. But a special meeting of EC competition experts, who were to have discussed the tie-up, is still being held on Thursday to debate separate plans to merge Time Warner with the world's largest internet service provider, America Online. A final ruling on the $135bn AOL and Time Warner merger, which would create the world's biggest combined internet and media company, is expected in about two weeks' time. Richard Parsons, Time Warner's president, said the music tie-up would have united ""two of the most creative and complementary organisations in the worldwide music industry"". The agreement would have set up a 50:50 joint venture, named Warner EMI Music, representing 2,500 artists including Madonna and the Rolling Stones, and producing around 2,000 albums a year. EMI would have remained an independent company, with its own stock market listing. But the commission was concerned that the deal, by leaving just four major record labels in Europe, would allow the remaining players to exercise ""collective dominance"" over the market.  Universal Music, Bertelsmann and Sony Music are the three other main players. Mr Parsons on Thursday said Time Warner would pursue the EMI tie-up because of its potential ""to deliver extraordinary dividends to our artists, employees, shareholders and music lovers around the world"". Mr Nicoli said the merger would provide ""the opportunity to generate considerable cost savings and to build a unique, Anglo-American owned music company"". City analysts speculated that the firms might still pull off a tie-up, even a limited deal involving perhaps distribution and internet developments. Other observers sought alternative partners for EMI, proposing Disney, Sony and Microsoft as potential bidders. EMI shares stood 33p, or 6%, lower at 525.6p in lunchtime trading in London. The Time Warner-AOL merger, even if allowed by European officials, will still require approval from US competition authorities if it is to go ahead. The Federal Trade Commission has said it wants to see AOL and Time Warner agree to share their high-speed cable networks. In Washington, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) - also looking at the merger - has begun looking at possible regulations for the internet. The FCC is considering whether it should order cable companies to allow competing internet service providers on their networks."

They were convicted in May 1966 for the murders of the 10-year-old and Edward Evans, 17.  Both were jailed for life, and the judge recommended that they serve ""a very long time"".  Both later confessed to the further killings of Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12, burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor on the edge of the Peak District.  The fresh confessions counted against Hindley and contributed to the home secretary's decision never to release her.  Myra Hindley is determined that she has atoned for the Moors murders, and that after 31 years, she should be released from prison.  Ann West fought tirelessly against Hindley's release, and was determined that her struggle with liver cancer would not weaken her campaign.

Vowing to haunt Hindley from beyond the grave, she said: ""I will still be a thorn in her side after I pass on, I will haunt that woman for the rest of her life.  ""She's told so many lies over 30 years that she'd go on lying and lying and lying, just to get her freedom.  ""That's all she wants out of life, her freedom.""  Lesley Anne Downey was stripped, gagged, sexually assaulted and strangled before being buried in a shallow grave on Lancashire's bleak Saddleworth Moor.

She always believed that Lesley Ann died at Hindley's own hands.  But she said in 1997 she would be able to ""rest in peace"" if she knew that Hindley would never be released.  Her wish was granted that year when the High Court agreed with successive home secretaries who had prevented the killer's release.  In the interview, Mrs West, who died at her home in Fallowfield, Manchester, told Sky she drew comfort from the belief she would be reunited with her daughter in death.  She said: ""I speak to Lesley, I have done from the night she went missing, and I can't wait to join her, but I didn't want it to happen this way, I wanted Hindley to go before me, actually."""

185,"One of Africa's major oil producers, Angola is striving to tackle the physical, social and political legacy of a 27-year civil war that ravaged the country after independence.  Following the withdrawal of the Portuguese colonial masters in 1975, the rival former independence movements competed for power until 2002.  Much of Angola's oil wealth lies in Cabinda province, where a decades-long separatist conflict simmers.  The government has sent thousands of troops to subdue the rebellion in the enclave, which has no border with the rest of Angola. Human rights groups have alleged abuses against civilians.  Jose Eduardo dos Santos, of the ruling MPLA, has been in power since 1979, and is Africa's second-longest serving head of state after Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang. He keeps tight control over all aspects of Angola's political life.  Many Angolans credit the president for leading the country to recovery after the end of its 27-year civil war in 2002, and for turning the country's formerly socialist economy into one of the world's fastest-growing - mainly on the back of Angola's prodigious oil wealth.  Some, however, accuse him of authoritarianism, staying in office for too long and failing to distribute the proceeds from the oil boom more widely.  In 2008, his party won the country's first parliamentary elections for 16 years. A new constitution approved in 2010 substituted direct election of the president with a system under which the top candidate of the largest party in parliament becomes president.  It also strengthened the presidency's powers, prompting the Unita opposition to accuse the government of ""destroying democracy"".  He appointed his daughter Isabel as chief executive of the state-run oil firm Sonangol in 2016, prompting suspicions that he is establishing a dynasty at a time he is winding down his own career. In early 2017 she acquired a controlling stake in the country's largest bank, BFA.  Isabel has been ranked by Forbes magazine as the richest woman on the continent with a fortune of around $3 billion.  Social media appeared to be under threat at the end of 2015 when President dos Santos called for their stricter regulation, at a time when the government was cracking down on political dissident and activism.  For many urban Angolans, the internet has become the primary medium for expression of political anger because of the dangers of protesting on the streets.  The state controls all media with nationwide reach, including radio, the most influential medium outside the capital.  17th and 18th centuries - Angola becomes a major Portuguese trading arena for slaves.

186,"In 1997 Labour ended 18 years in the political wilderness in spectacular style.  The party returned to power with a parliamentary landslide, winning the biggest majority held by any government since 1935.  Tony Blair's New Labour had gained a staggering 179-seat overall majority in the Commons as the Conservatives were tossed aside by the voters.  The election also saw the Liberal Democrats put in a remarkable performance, more than doubling their number of MPs despite taking a reduced share of the vote compared with 1992.  In the election's aftermath, commentators speculated whether it was at all possible for the Conservatives to overturn such a huge majority in a single election.  John Major had virtually no honeymoon period after his election victory in 1992.  Within months of the Tories' fourth election win on the trot, events were to take place that went a long way to losing them the next contest before it was even on the political horizon.  The whole of the parliament was dominated by open Tory feuding on Europe and this bickering was responsible for the government's defeat on the Maastricht Bill in 1993 as well as for John Redwood's 1995 leadership challenge.  Sleaze, as well as splits, also hit the party with 12 resignations from office taking place over allegations of personal impropriety, among the most famous being Jonathan Aitken and Neil Hamilton.  Labour also had an eventful parliament. John Smith replaced Neil Kinnock as leader, but died of a heart attack in May 1994.  He was replaced by the shadow home secretary, Tony Blair.  Under Blair the ""modernisation"" process set in train by Neil Kinnock stepped up several gears, as the party ditched the commitment to nationalisation set out in Clause IV of its constitution and took to referring to itself as New Labour.  With Blair at the helm the polls briefly registered a Labour lead over the Tories' of above 30%. After the best part of 20 years in opposition, Labour's return to power at the next election looked a sure thing.  John Major left it until the last possible minute before calling the 1997 election, in the hope that the ""feel-good factor"" that accompanies economic prosperity would turn around Tory fortunes in the polls.  Unluckily for him, it never did.  Left with little alternative, Major hoped a long campaign - six weeks, from 17 March to polling day on 1 May - would expose New Labour's policies to scrutiny and see the party's relatively inexperienced leadership crack under pressure.  But in the face of a professional, super-disciplined and highly cautious campaign by a Labour Party fearful of losing an election it was overwhelmingly expected to win, the Tory strategy had little impact.  Labour had adopted campaigning techniques from the US, including a rapid rebuttal unit designed to ensure a swift and sure response to any Conservative attacks on the party.  The party's campaigners were kept ruthlessly on-message for the duration by fax, bleeper and mobile phone.  Throughout the campaign the Tories experienced nothing but bad news. The Sun newspaper turned traitor on the party it had energetically championed at the previous four elections, now coming out for New Labour.  Sleaze blew the Tory campaign off course. An MP was revealed to be having an affair with a night-club hostess.  And as the long weeks passed the Tories failed to land any punches on New Labour. Even the old bogey of Labour's relations with the unions failed to chime with many voters - many of whom had never lived under a Labour government.  One of the few memorable episodes came when Labour and the Liberal Democrats agreed not to field candidates in Tatton after they had persuaded BBC journalist Martin Bell to stand on a independent ticket against Neil Hamilton.  The Tory MP strongly denied the sleaze allegations against him, and with his formidable wife confronted the war correspondent on Knutsford Heath in full view of the media.  Tony Blair was by no means alone in creating what was to become New Labour, but he more than anyone else came to personify it.  It was under his leadership that the ""modernisation"" of the party was escalated to a degree not previously thought possible. The priority remained to strip away policies that he believed had lost the party the crucial support of the middle classes in 1992.  Blair - a public school, Oxford-educated barrister - was no son of the left or the Labour movement, although he was a onetime supporter of CND.  Before becoming leader in 1994 he was shadow home secretary, but having entered Parliament in the Thatcher years he had no experience of government.  After gaining the support of his powerful colleague and potential rival Gordon Brown for his leadership bid after John Smith's death, Blair won hands down in the contest between himself, John Prescott and Margaret Beckett.  The dramatic changes - in the face of disquiet - Blair oversaw to his own party allowed him to cast himself in the role of a strong, commanding leader, taunting John Major: ""l lead my party, he follows his"".  For John Major the 1992-1997 parliament had been a bruising ride.  The Tories lost their way as feuding over European policy and sleaze both pointed to a party tired after having spent nearly 20 years in office.  But despite the Tories' problems, by 1997 Major could point to a strong economy - and campaigned on the theme ""Britain's booming, don't let Labour ruin it"".  However, since the Tories had denied responsibility for the recession of the early 1990s, the voters did not give them credit for the subsequent recovery.  For Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown - the oldest but perhaps most energetic of the main party leaders - the campaign was particularly demanding, as he was the key nationally recognised figure in his party.  His strong personality - and his ability to speak with authority on foreign affairs, particularly Bosnia - as well as a forthright style impressed many voters, even though his party seemed to be polling a lower share of the vote than in 1992.  New Labour fought this election with its policies already clearly hammered out.  In the summer of 1996 it released a draft manifesto, and a few days later released its pledge card.  The five pledges - used throughout the campaign - with their promise not to raise income tax, to cut class sizes and reduce NHS waiting lists, were designed to defuse still further any Tory attacks on Labour as a tax and spend party.  This strategy was built on in January 1997 when shadow chancellor Gordon Brown accepted Tory spending plans for Labour's first two years in office - should the party be elected.  The manifesto proper, released during the campaign - New Labour Because Britain Deserves Better - fleshed out the five pledges, again underlining that there would be no increase in income tax.  It also made clear in a 10-point contract with the people that education would be the government's top priority.  The Tory manifesto, released a day ahead of Labour, was entitled - You Can Only Be Sure With the Conservatives - and kept the party's options open on whether to join the single currency, but firmly rejected a federal Europe.  It made pledges to privatise the London Underground as well as imagining a state were the State Earnings Related Pension was phased out - neither commitments were solid vote winners.  Like Labour the Liberal Democrats put education at the top of their agenda.  They promised £2bn would be pumped into the schools system, while they also offered to restore fee eye and dental checks.  To make good his commitments Paddy Ashdown told the voters that the party would need an extra 1p on income tax if elected.  Also standing at this election was the Referendum Party, founded and funded by millionaire businessman Sir James Goldsmith.  The party had the simple aim - opposed as it was to the creation of a European super-state - of ensuring a referendum was held on the future of the UK's relationship with the EU."
187,"It is Africa's largest country. It has more pyramids than Egypt. But Sudan is not in the headlines for its heritage.  A new exhibit of ancient Sudanese artefacts at the British Museum in London is hoping to go some way to change this.  ""Sudan is not well known in the West, and unfortunately if it is known, it's only for very bad things. Now is an opportunity to show another face of the Sudan - one of civilisation.""  As director of fieldwork for the national museum in Khartoum, Dr Saleh Mohammed Ahmed is familiar with the treasures loaned to the British Museum.  When the show was first mooted five years ago, it was hoped it might mark the signing of a peace treaty ending the civil war.  Instead, the news is full of the crisis in Darfur, while some of the country's most exciting archaeological sites are about to disappear under a dam project.  And a few months ago, the Khartoum museum was robbed of dozens of major pieces.  In various ways, the show at the British Museum sheds light on each of these issues.  Curator Derek Welsby points out a big white bone at the entrance to the gallery.  It is a fossil giraffe bone, next to a picture of where it was found in the arid moonscape of the Sudanese desert.  ""What this shows us is that once upon a time, what is now one of the most arid places on the planet had a population of big game with people fishing and hunting,"" he says.  ""You can see how fluid the climate is, and how this causes all sorts of problems to present-day populations as it did to people in the past.""  This lends a sobering historical perspective to the struggles over land occupation in Darfur, but elsewhere in the gallery there is more hopeful evidence of a history of mutual tolerance between Sudan's ethnic and religious groups.  By the 10th Century, there were three Christian kingdoms in the area, and on display is a jeweller's mould found in a Christian site and used for casting Koranic inscriptions.  ""We've got Christian sites where there are clearly Muslims living as part of the resident population. We have Muslim tombstones found adjacent to ones inscribed in Greek, old Nubian and Coptic, for example.""  One of the least-known areas of Sudan is the inhospitable region round the fourth cataract of the Nile.  This area is about to flooded by a 160km-long (100 mile) lake for a hydroelectric dam.  Just as 40 years ago when the temples at Abu Simbel in Egypt were threatened by the Aswan dam, rescue archaeologists are hard at work.  And they are finding astonishing riches in the dry, termite-free area they thought was empty of artefacts.  ""We are rewriting the history of Sudan, finding materials from all periods,"" says Dr Saleh.  They have discovered fortresses, cities, cemeteries and even a pyramid where they thought there was nothing.  And its all about to be obliterated.  Neil Macgregor, director of the British Museum, hopes the exhibition will alert the world to this archaeological race against time, but he is mindful of other priorities, too.  The British Museum is waiving its entry fee in place of a suggested donation to relief charities in Darfur.  ""Whatever happens politically, it's going to be more important than ever to understand what this country is about. That's what this exhibition is for.""  As in the cases of Iraq and Iran, the international community of archaeologists and scholars is working to keep lines of communication open during politically difficult times.  And the pieces stolen from Khartoum?  Fifty-seven of them were recovered two weeks ago in Omdurman, just outside Khartoum, safe and intact.  Some good news at least from Sudan, at a time when it is in short supply."
188,"Luke Rhinehart is the pen name of the author George Cockcroft. Or should that be that George is the legal name of the diceperson Luke? Whoever he is, he's written some fine works of fiction, each of which give tantalising glimpses of a philosophy known among his followers as 'the dicelife'.  Luke's writing style for his dice-based books is as ingenious as it is twisted. Whereas most books are written from a single static perspective, Luke switches between a first and third person view, and intersperses that narrative flow with excerpts from journals, minutes of meetings, and many others - which really gives the impression that this is a huge story, of which just a glimpse is being seen. Especially clever is his habit of quoting from other books, both real, fictional, and in one case, yet to be written.  Similarly, the moods of the book change rapidly too. A single book might have sections of porn, thriller, comedy, psychology, romance, philosophy, and detective in it - not mixed together, but standing side by side with only a chapter number, if that, between them. Some find that this makes the books drag, but no two people agree on what sections should be cut.  The best parts of the stories from a casual reader's perspective are the sections of sheer hilarity, which come in brief ten page bursts. Luke is a master of carefully timed comic relief, just when you thought the story was starting to become serious. Whether it's a sex scene in the middle of a river, the dice parties, the beating down of authority, the hallucinogenic tomato plant, or some of the dice games, there will be moments when you have to tear your eyes from the text to control your laughter.  On the other hand, Long Voyage Back, and Matari show that he is entirely comfortable writing somewhat more traditional fiction, and Book of Est shows he's perfectly capable of writing wholly factual accounts too.  Whichever book he writes, he tends to focus strongly on just a few characters, perhaps five that are important. Other protagonists come and go, but are generally shallow characters that Luke uses to bounce concepts off. Through that, the books get to be compelling, and hard to put down.  Luke's first book, The Dice Man was published in 1971 with the confidant subheader, 'This book can change your life'. It quickly became a cult classic, as people read it and passed it around. Some in authority saw it as subversive, reflecting the mood of the early 1970s in permissiveness, and anti-psychiatry sentiment, and it was banned in several countries.  It went through a number of republishings - in the USA it got the even more confident subheader 'Few novels can change your life. This one will', but was cut somewhat from the original. Perhaps because of this, and despite the author and the character both being American, it was slightly less successful than in the UK and Scandinavia.  The book tells the story (there is a persistent rumour that the book is based on a true story) of a psychologist named Luke who, feeling bored and unfulfilled in life, starts making decisions about what to do based on a roll of a dice. Along the way, there is sex, rape, murder, 'dice parties', breakouts by psychiatric patients, and various corporate and governmental machines being put into a spin. There is also a description of the cult that starts to develop around the man, and the psychological research he initiates, such as the 'F**k without Fear for Fun and Profit' programme.  Published in 1975, this novel is currently out-of-print and very hard to find. The story is set in 18th Century Japan, and features a conflict between four very different characters - Oboko, a poet of the wind and Buddhist monk; Izzi, court poet and extrovert; Lord Arishi, samurai, and lord of the realm; and finally Matari, beautiful, intelligent, and on the run for her life.  The story might be described as a love story - all three of the men are, in their own way, in love with Matari. Yet they each have their own outlook on life, and their own sense of honour and morality - while individually we might applaud them as good men and true, the meeting of the three results in tragedy.  This is a classic work of fiction; the story runs in a linear fashion, and the plot is such as you might find in any other book. Rhinehart uses his knowledge of Zen well, though, and the book gives an insight into the thinking of both Buddhist and Samurai thinking that feels full and well-rounded - unlike the superficial treatment of these topics in a lot of Western writing.  Erhard Seminars Training, or Est, described itself as a psychological and philosophical tool, supposedly based on the works of the philosopher Heidegger, and was started by Werner Erhard, a former Scientologist, who left to start Est. The idea of Est is meant to be to break down an individual's personality and rebuild it as part of the group, giving people a new and better perspective on life. It's now out of print, and has been omitted from recent 'also written by' lists in the books, implying, perhaps, that the author is a little ashamed of having written it in the first place.  The book was published in 1976 and purports to represent the experience of the original Est seminars, written by one who went through them. It shows them in a positive light, and describes how the ideas and the training affected the author as he went through the course. A section towards the end of the book discusses the background to some of the ideas in it.  Est, or The Landmark Forum as it is now known, has endured some criticism during its time, both from anti-cult groups, and from various Christian populists. An independent and moderately favourable view might be obtained from The Skeptics's Dictionary.  Long Voyage Back was published in 1983, at the height of the cold war, and shows that influence. The author sides with the nuclear disarmament side of the debate and the only character in the book with vociferous views on the subject, the daughter of the lead character, probably represents Rhinehart's own views.  The story concerns a forthcoming nuclear war between the USSR and the USA, and graphically depicts the ensuing carnage. One family and some friends try to run away in a sailboat, and the story describes their battles with nuclear winter, fallout, the army, enlistment, farmers, getting supplies and pirates, among other things.  It's an horrific story, made worse by its 'believability'. One memorable pre-war statement was that, 'In a nuclear war, the USSR will win. This is because the average Russian doesn't have a gun, so they can't all shoot each other and the army for food'. Ouch.  Adventures of Wim was published in 1986, and was sold as 'The sequel, well almost, to The Dice Man'. Unfortunately, it's no longer in print, though it's reasonably easy to find in libraries and second-hand bookshops in the UK. It is possibly the best of Luke's books, and is well worth the effort to find it.  It takes Luke's style to its logical conclusion, as the entire book is made up of sections taken from other, fictional books. It seems that an entire industry has grown up publishing books about a Montauk named Wim - later books refer to him as Whim - including The Gospel According to Luke (Luke Forth, not Luke Rhinehart)and the screenplay of a movie. The screenplay is possibly in there as a result of Luke Rhinehart's continuing frustration in trying to get The Dice Man turned into a good movie. Adventures, then, is an effort to create a new interpretation of the story of Wim, drawing on the many previous efforts, and so providing a multi-faceted and whimsical account of 'one of the greatest figures in the 20th and 21st Century'.  A boy is born of a virgin mother and is named 'Wim', Montauk for 'Wave Rider'. He is pronounced to be the saviour of the Montauk nation by his tribe's navigator, and educated in their ways. Sadly, the humans steal him away and attempt to educate him in more useful skills, such as American Football.  Wim, also known as 'He of Many Chances', proves to be an inefficient saviour, as God sends him on a quest for Ultimate Truth. This does not seem to be something that will benefit his tribe terribly, but the navigator isn't one to stare down the barrel of a lightning gun, and sends him on his way. After a long and arduous search, Wim finds ultimate truth, and with it the cure for the sickness of the human condition. Hurrah!  There's a lot of philosophy in this book, and it's a more open view than in previous books. It would spoil the shock value to give away the ideas, but suffice it to say that it ties in with the views of The Dice Man, but in a softer and more accepting way, and with more paths to enlightenment. It's also the funniest book Luke has written to date. If that's not enough, then you should definitely read this book to learn how to do that perfect basketball hook shot.  This is the official sequel to The Dice Man, and was published in 1993. It is set 20 years after the end of The Dice Man, and Luke's dicechild, Larry, has grown up to become a hotshot investor on the stock market. He has totally rejected his father's reverence for chance: he sees it as an adversary to be overcome, and has managed to create a stable, normal life for himself, in spite of his early abandonment. Indeed, he is due to wed the daughter of his boss, and live wealthily ever after.  This state of affairs would make a dull story and soon his father's ghostly presence intervenes. He gets approached by the FBI, who are trying to trace his father's location, and find out whether he's alive or dead, and though he naturally refuses to have anything to do with them, he soon starts to pursue his own investigations. He is financed in this by his fiancée's father, who wants to put the whole dice business to rest, and is accompanied by his fiancée's sister, an unreformed hippy.  Well, it takes a long time - a whole book in fact, but Larry eventually does complete his quest. Along the way, what he's seen and heard have changed him somewhat and the ending has a delightful twist. However, written by Larry rather than Luke, and by an author who's perhaps mellowed with age, the general opinion seems to be that it's just not quite as good as the original. Or maybe it just doesn't appeal in the same way...  The Book of the Die is mentioned as a fictional book in many of Luke's earlier works, and he chose the year 2000 to make it a reality. The book is a collection of thoughts and ideas about dicing - its purpose, the meaning of life, and so forth - much in the style that might be expected from Luke. Interspersed with this are frequent parables, poems, stories. Some are from his earlier books, some from the new ones, some stolen and rewritten from various well-known sayings and writings, some from his followers (both real and imaginary), and some which purport to be from his own life.  The whole thing is broken into 21 chapters, plus an introduction and explanation of the whole thing. The idea is meant to be that you roll two dice to decide which chapter to read, or look for answers in, or perhaps flick through to pick one which seems appropriate, or maybe read in order like any other book. As long as people are aware of their options, eh?  Also, roughly at the end of each chapter are six dice options, with the standard instructions:  The dice options, and the book in general, aim to be intriguing and thought-provoking, and certainly succeed in that. It's in some sense a book with all the answers - written by someone who has thought about such things for most of his life. Yet it's also a book of no answers, as Luke consistently tries to ensure that the reader is aware that the book is just another illusion. 'Dice living is a load of shit', he says at one point. And it contains large sections of hilarity and absurdity.  There is a forthcoming book planned for release next year entitled Whim, about the complete life of Wim, including parts not covered by Adventures of Wim.  There are also continuing plans to release the story of either Luke, Larry, or Wim as a movie. Currently the rights to Search for the Diceman rest with New Line Cinema, and Brian Evans has written a screenplay for it but nothing has happened to it so far. The rights to The Diceman rest with Paramount Pictures.  Luke has written a number of screenplays himself, including one on The Dice Man, and Adventures of Wim, in an effort to accelerate the process, but with no success. Luke Rhinehart would seem not to be a Hollywood-style hero.  Companies being companies, have often attempted to profit from the ideas of the Dice Man, and a few such ventures are noted below. Also, a number of musicians, writers, artists, and other people have been influenced by the ideas. A wide influence for a small paperback book sold for less than a fiver.  Dice have always been colloquially referred to as rocks, and the makers of Rolling Rock lager knew a good tie-in when they saw one. They launched a series of adverts based around the diceman theme, and even a Diceliving website, and have since been strongly associated with Luke's books.  Indeed, the rise from the dead of Rolling Rock in the late 1990s has partially been attributed to the rise of dicing at around the same time, fueled, perhaps, by Internet chatrooms where role-playing is common.  The Discovery Channel recently hired a pair of part-time dicers to do a Diceman Travel Programme based on the dice. Where they go, what they see, and what they do, all are based on the roll of a dice. Apparently it's been popular, though the tendency of the dice to steer the couple off in strange directions has caused problems for the producers and editors.  Also on film, there have been at least three documentaries on diceliving and the philosophy of the dice, including one 50-minute short film called Dice World by Paul Wilmshurst, and published by Channel Four in the USA.  Luke sprinkles a liberal variety of new words and phrases into his books, none of which have entered popular language. A few choice examples are 'dicesciple' and 'I'll be diced'.  It's even inspired a computer font - 'Living by Numbers' by Ray Larabie.  Johan Neilson created a definitive dicing resource in his Six Sided Homepage back in 1997 in response to a lack of such sites on the web in general. To date it's still running well, though it does suffer from a Y2K bug. But why would a dice care about the date?  The diceman has turned up in several songs - here's a quick list:  Jock's Image Gallery shows six 'chance and decision' paintings, which were drawn using a method inspired by The Dice Man.  Ben Marshall, of Loaded magazine, has spent the past two years experimenting with being a diceman, and writing up his experiences in the magazine. This seems to have been a big hit with the readers, and Loaded subsequently named Luke Rhinehart as writer of the century. Praise indeed.  Most authors have nice biographies which show a place of birth, current location, and preferably a few nice pictures. Not this one. Those few facts and figures which are out in the public domain are uncertain. In any case, one would expect a diceperson to be free and loose with the truth. This is certainly the impression he gives when writing:  One wonders if celebrities should try and catch on to this model for privacy - creating so much inaccurate and contradictory information that nobody knows who they are. This elusiveness is helped by his followers, who are always at their most unreliable when answering questions about him. This is no doubt inspired by The Search for the Dice Man, where his fictional followers are equally creative in their answers.  The same process holds good for questions on the real life existence of dice centres and similar concepts from the book. It has been claimed that 'Barter Books' in Alnwick, England is a dice centre, for example. Maybe it is. Maybe it's a brilliant marketing scheme.  The books claim copyrights by either Luke Rhinehart or George Cockcroft. There are the following hints in their cover notes, but this is all there is...  George Cockcroft was born on 15 November, 1932 , son of an engineer and a civil servant. He got his BA at Cornell University, and his MA at Columbia University, where he married on 30 June, 1956. Subsequently he got a PhD in psychology, also at Columbia, and had three children, in no particular order.  He subsequently went into teaching, teaching English at a number of places, until 1970 when he became a full-time writer and leader of the dice cult.  His religion is Zen Buddhist (from the stories, Luke was a Zen Buddhist before he found the dice, though the book does rather ridicule the religion) and he is a member of, amongst others, The Authors Guild, the Hudson Valley Writers Guild, Phi Beta Kappa, and Phi Kappa Phi. He is also a sailing enthusiast.  Luke Rhinehart was a psychology professor who, bored with his lot, moved himself, his wife, and his three kids, to a Spanish island and wrote The Dice Man. Since then he has made only occasional stealthy contact to sell new books, and is still wanted by his government for unpaid taxes.  Luke started experimenting with dice a long time before writing The Dice Man, but this made progress on the novel rather slow. When he actually finished it, he was 37, and lived in Majorca teaching English to the hippies (or maybe teaching the English to be hippies - the text is ambiguous). It was only by chance that he ran into a publisher, and the rest of the world could share his dream.  Later on he spent some time in a sailboat in the Mediterranean, and from there moved to a former surfer retreat on the edge of a lake. He's not quite as evangelical as the Luke who wrote The Dice Man, and has settled down a whole lot.  They proceeded to link David Bowie's success to reading the book, though they did admit that they have no evidence. Good story, though.  There are those who suspect that George Cockroft and HF Keating - author of Memoirs of an Invisible Man - are one and the same person. This is based on the fact that the two authors in these books share the following techniques and similarities:  It has also been rumoured that a different person wrote Search for the Diceman than the one that wrote The Dice Man, which is certainly possible. Maybe a son, or relation, or someone else just trying to cash in on the name. Can you figure it out?  Good question. His last known mailing address was Luke Hill in Canaan, New York. Further research reveals that he is on the Advisory Committee Board of the International Writers' Colony at Ledig House. But essentially, you don't find the Dice Man - he finds you."
189,"The instrument, made in 1707, broke the previous record of $2.03m (£1.07m) paid for a Stradivarius in 2003.  The buyer has not been revealed but Christie's in New York said he was a ""benefactor and patron of the arts"" who loves classical music.  It had been privately owned but was loaned to world-renowned orchestras.  The auction was tense, with gasps punctuating the bidding. A round of applause broke out when the price reached $3m (£1.5m).  ""I have to admit it took my breath away,"" said Kerry Keane, head of the musical instrument department for the auction house.  He said the violin is likely to be heard in performances around the world following the purchase.  He crafted over 1,000 violins, violas and violoncellos, and was commissioned by King James II of England and King Charles III of Spain.  Stradivari's later works are said to be some of his most powerful sounding instruments and the most coveted by musicians.  ""These violins produce a sound, a tonal quality, that is unrivalled by any other maker,"" said Mr Keane.  ""When they're played you can hear it at the front of the hall, and you can hear it all the way up at the back in the cheap seats.""  The instrument sold at Christie's is known as The Hammer, and is named after Christian Hammer, a 19th Century Swedish collector.  It was made during Stradivari's ""golden period"" of 1700-1720, and was brought to the United States in 1911.  Before the auction, Christies had valued the violin between $1.5m (£800,000) and $2.5m (£1.3m)."
190,"The body of a top Italian banker has been found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London.  Known as God's banker for his links with the Vatican, 62-year-old Roberto Calvi was the chairman of Banco Ambrosiano in Milan and a central figure in a complex web of international fraud and intrigue.  He had been missing for the last nine days before his body was discovered by a passer-by hanging from scaffolding on a riverside walk under the bridge.  Police are treating the death as suicide.  Mr Calvi became chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, now Italy's largest private bank, in 1975 and built up a vast financial empire.  In 1978, a report by the Bank of Italy on Ambrosiano concluded that several billion lire had been illegally exported.  In May 1981, Mr Calvi was arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to four years' imprisonment, but released pending an appeal. During his short spell in jail he attempted suicide.  Mr Calvi was due to appear in an Italian court next week to appeal against this conviction.  Later this month he was to be tried for alleged fraud involving property deals with Sicilian banker Michele Sindona, who is himself serving 25 years in America over the collapse of the Franklin National Bank in New York in 1974.  The Vatican is directly linked to Mr Calvi by Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, the Pope's bodyguard, a governor of the Vatican and head of the Vatican bank which has a shareholding in Ambrosiano.  Now Ambrosiano is on the verge of collapse amid press reports that investigators found a £400m ""hole"" in its accounts. Last week the bank's executive board decided to strip Mr Calvi of his authority.  The Italian Treasury dissolved the bank's administration and the Bank of Italy is now a temporary commissioner.  Mr Calvi fled to Venice nine days ago after shaving his moustache to avoid being recognised.  From there it seems he hired a private plane to take him to London.  The day before he was found dead, his secretary committed suicide in Milan by jumping off the fourth floor of the bank's headquarters.  Teresa Corrocher, aged 55, left an angry suicide note condemning her boss for the damage she said he had done to Ambrosiano and its employees."
191,"Four years ago in Beijing, the velodrome was paved with gold for Great Britain's cyclists - and expectations will be high for a repeat performance in London.  Riders such as Victoria Pendleton and Sir Chris Hoy have emerged as household names on the back of their exploits charging around the banked oval track at speeds approaching 50mph.  A lot has changed in the interim, with new restraints being imposed on the use of technology, including the banning of the plasticised skinsuits worn so successfully by Team GB.  Each nation has been limited to one participant in individual events - Great Britain multi-medalled in four of the 10 events in Beijing - and five of the 10 disciplines on show have been changed to give parity to the men and women competing.  The cyclists at the velodrome in the Olympic Park will now compete in the sprint, team sprint, keirin (where riders follow a motorcycle and build up to a sprint finish), team pursuit and omnium (a six-discipline event which is like the decathlon in athletics).  Track racing is an exciting and physically demanding sport, with an hour-long session likely to burn approximately 782 calories per hour.  The strain of keeping the bike in motion at speed increases the heart rate, lowers blood pressure and improves endurance.  As the thigh, calf and hip muscles are in constant use, it is an effective way to help build lower-body strength.  Unlike other high-energy sports, bike riding has a much lower risk of injury as there is none of the physical contact between athletes found in football or rugby, while it is much gentler on the knee and ankle joints than long-distance running.  Biking does not only have to be done as a sport. A study by the International Bicycle Fund found commuters who begin to ride their bicycles to and from work instead of driving lose an average of 13 pounds during their first year of biking.  As training for track racing is often team-based pursuit, it is an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people.  Clubs also offer a variety of social events beyond just riding.  Approximately two million people in Britain cycle at least once a week, and there are more than 80,000 members of cycling clubs.  Before taking to the course, it is essential to wear safety equipment such as a helmet, cycling gloves and elbow and knee pads. If you are riding on public roads, it is important to wear high visibility gear.  It is further recommended that a long sleeved top be worn for added protection.  Some clubs allow members to hire bikes and helmets. A decent starter track bike costs around £300, and it is important to buy a track bike as mountain, road and hybrid BMX bikes are ill-suited to ride on velodrome circuits.  Training days and taster schemes are run for people of all ages and abilities throughout the year. Visit the British Cycling,Cycling Ireland,Scottish Cycling and Welsh Cycling websites for more information.  For regional and national events, membership of British Cycling or Cycling Ireland is required. There are a number of bands related to how regularly you wish to compete.  Small fees are often required to take part in the 3,000+ cycling meets held annually throughout the country.  For parents looking to get their children started in competitive racing, British Cycling are running a number of events for under-16s throughout the United Kingdom this year. Visit the 'Go-Ride Racing' website for more details.  Sky Ride are offering free cycling events across the country throughout the summer. Their website also contains information about where you can find your nearest cycling route.  Fun, free and informal bike rides just for women are also available through Sky Ride's Breeze scheme.  'Join In Local Sport' aims to get as many people as possible to turn up and take part in activities at their local sports facilities on 18/19 August, 2012 - the first weekend between the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The aim of the initiative is for every sports club and community group in the UK to put on a special event in a bid to encourage more people to get involved as members, supporters or volunteers.  More than 4,000 local sports clubs will be opening their doors to host events and show people just how they can get involved.  As well as tips on playing sport there will be information on coaching, supporting and how to help out.  Find an event near you.  More on the London 2012 website  In both team events, the teams start on opposing sides of the track and, in case of a tie, the team with the fastest time over the last lap (or a previous lap if the last lap time is the same) will be declared the winner.  In the team pursuit, the winner is whichever team catches the other team, or records the fastest time over the full distance of the race.  The men's race takes place over 4km and the women's race takes place over 3km.  In the team sprint, each rider in a team must lead for a lap. The first rider leads for the first lap, then leaves the track, allowing the second-placed rider to lead.  In the men's race, this happens again in the third lap. At the end of the race, just one rider from each team is left on the track.  In the individual sprint, two riders go head-to-head over three laps with the fastest progressing to the next round.  The competition starts with a 200m flying start (a time trial beginning with 2½ build-up laps), which establishes the seeding for the event.  Thereafter, riders go head-to-head in a knockout format. Up to the quarter-finals, losing riders get another chance to progress through a repechage.  From the quarter-finals onwards, races are the best-of-three.  The keirin is an eight-lap event, in which riders follow a moped which gradually increases in speed from 30kph to 50kph for the men and 25kph to 45kph for the women, which it reaches with four laps of the track to go. The moped leaves the track with 2½ laps to go, leaving the riders to battle it out over a sprint finish.  The flying lap event in the omnium sees the athletes steadily gain pace for 2½ laps before the final 250m lap is timed. In the points race, final placings are decided according to accumulated points won by riders during mid-race sprints.  In the elimination race, sprints are held on every other lap and the last sprinter to cross the finishing line is eliminated until one rider remains.  In the scratch race a straight race is held over 15km for men, and 10km for women. In the time trial, two riders compete against each to register the fastest time over over 1km for the men and 500m for the women.  In all events, times are measured to 1/1,000th of a second.  More on the UCI website  Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton are the king and queen of British track cycling, while Laura Trott seems destined to be one of the faces of these Games.  Australian darling - and Pendleton's arch-rival - Anna Meares and French powerhouse Gregory Bauge will be hard to beat in the sprints.  Jack Bobridge will spearhead Australia's men's team pursuit team, who are still smarting from their defeat to GB at the World Championships earlier this year.  Track cycling was first established in Great Britain in the 1870s when wooden indoor tracks, consisting of two straights and slightly banked turns, were laid.  The sport proved a popular attraction and early races at venues in Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester and London attracted crowds of up to 2,000 people.  Track cycling events have been organised at all the editions of the Olympics since 1896, with the only exception being the 1912 Games in Stockholm, when only the road race was staged.  Between 1924 and 1992, the range of events at the Olympics were usually a sprint, time trial over one kilometre, tandem and team pursuit. The individual pursuit was added in the 1964 Olympic in Tokyo, and the tandem was dropped after the 1972 Games in Munich.  Women first competed in a sprint track event in 1988, and the individual pursuit was added in Barcelona four years later.  In February 2011, the Velodrome became the first competition venue in the Olympic Park to be completed.  More on the IOC website"
192,"                           In the aftermath of the disaster at Chernobyl, a team of soviet scientists risked their lives by going back into the reactor to investigate the scale of the damage. The investigation, dubbed Complex Expedition, was driven by the fear that there could be a second accident at Chernobyl if the missing nuclear fuel - plutonium, uranium and other extremely radioactive elements - was not located and contained. Radiation emissions were still dangerously high and the scientists were exposed to levels of radiation that would be considered almost suicidal in the West. At the time, they had been worried that the uncontrollable reactor might explode again, and had to assume that a self-sustaining chain reaction was possible. To prevent this, the Red Army initially bombed the reactor with neutron absorbers and other chemicals. The intense radiation killed several pilots. It is now known that, despite those sacrifices, almost no neutron absorbers reached the core. Inexplicably on May 6th, the emissions stopped. Something had happened in the core of the reactor. Engineers began work on the construction of a concrete sarcophagus to surround the failed reactor to stop rain getting in and triggering a second explosion. Forced to build straight on to the damaged, red hot hull of Chernobyl Unit Four, the Russian energy authorities faced the biggest civil engineering task in history. A quarter of a million construction workers on the Chernobyl sarcophagus reached official lifetime limits of radiation. When the problem seemed to be literally buried, scientists working inside the reactor continued their hunt for nuclear fuel. Collected manually, the cold rods of fuel that turned up could not account for the great heat still emanating from the core. The scientists monitored rates of radiation in the building by drilling into the heart of the sarcophagus and inserting long metal detector tubes into the reactor to measure rates of radioactive decay. As well as radiation, they were exposed to high levels of radioactive dust. Meanwhile, volunteers from the military were working on the exterior of the building, pushing nuclear fuel rods that had been spat out in the blast, back into the reactor ruins. The hunt for nuclear fuel went on for six months before there was any result. Lava, glass and crystal flow discovered in the base of the reactor In December 1986, an intensely radioactive mass was discovered in the basement of Unit Four and scientists rigged up a crude wheeled camera to investigate. The mass was more than two metres across and weighed hundreds of tons. Because of its odd wrinkled shape, it was christened, ""the elephant's foot"". To approach it meant certain death. Analysis of the material showed that it was composed of sand, glass and nuclear fuel, and the proportion of sand suggested to scientists that a large amount of fuel had escaped from the reactor in this form. Underneath the reactor, the investigation team found steaming hot concrete and, draining into the basement, lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms - Chernobylite. The findings meant that the risk of a second explosion had receded, but that serious problems remained. The explosion dislodged the 2000 ton lid of the reactor The walls of the sarcophagus are starting to fall down, having been built straight on top of the collapsed and unstable reactor walls. If the walls collapse, the resulting radioactive dust will escape. The explosion also threw the 2000 ton reactor lid into the air. It fell on its edge into the mouth of the core, and rests at a precarious angle half way down. Scientists who worked on the Complex Exploration say that there are likely to be major collapses in the next ten years without further construction work. Russian research into Chernobyl has now been cut back because of safety problems, and the high death rate - caused by radiation and the stress related conditions - of the scientists involved An alliance of European companies has draw up plans to cover the reactor with a concrete structure designed to last longer than the pyramids, and big enough to allow the work of locating and packaging up radioactive material to continue. So far, the money needed to recover the site has not been found but the contents of the Chernobyl tomb will remain radioactive for at least the next 100,000 years.                             The BBC is not responsible for the content of these internet sites.

193,"The border area between the two countries remains heavily fortified Communist North Korea has said it is scrapping all military and political agreements signed with the South, accusing Seoul of hostile intent. South Korea's government had pushed relations ""to the brink of a war"", the North's cross-border relations body said on state media. Seoul expressed regret at the move, while the US called it ""unhelpful"". Relations have deteriorated since South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak took a harder line approach to the North. One agreement the North said it was to scrap covers the maritime border in the Yellow Sea. The two countries' navies fought bloody skirmishes in the area of the de facto border in 2002 and 1999. ""All the agreed points concerning the issue of putting an end to the political and military confrontation between the North and the South will be nullified,"" the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said. Position in Yellow Sea declared by UN in 1953 Deadly naval skirmishes along the line in 1999 and 2002 It said that the situation on the Korean peninsula had reached a point where there was ""neither way to improve [relations] nor hope to bring them on track"". The North has stepped up rhetorical attacks on the administration of South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who has promised to stop the free flow of aid to the North unless it moves to end its nuclear weapons programme. Earlier this week, North Korea criticised the appointment of a new South Korean unification minister, describing the choice of Hyun In-taek as evidence that the South wanted to intensify confrontation between the two Korean states. The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says some analysts believe that Pyongyang is trying to build up tensions with the South in order to give itself more negotiating power with the new US administration. HAVE YOUR SAY North Korea is an isolated state and when it isn't getting enough attention acts like a petulant child. A more pessimistic analysis suggests that the rising tension does raise the possibility of small-scale military clashes, says our correspondent. ""Our government expresses deep regret,"" said Kim Ho-nyoun, spokesman for South Korea's unification ministry, which handles cross-border affairs. ""We urge North Korea to accept our call for dialogue as soon as possible,"" he said.

The two Korean states are still technically at war because their three-year conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, in 1953. The peninsula remains divided by a heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone, with thousands of troops stationed on both sides of the border. Relations improved in the past decade, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il meeting with then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in a historic summit in 2000. But tensions have been high since Mr Lee took office in Seoul nearly a year ago pledging to get tough with Pyongyang. He began rolling back his predecessors' ""sunshine policy"" of unconditional aid to the North. The North responded by cutting off talks, suspending key joint projects and stepping up criticism of Mr Lee whom it calls a ""traitor"". ""Never to be condoned are the crimes the Lee group has committed against the nation and reunification by bedevilling overnight the inter-Korean relations that had favourably developed amidst the support and encouragement of all the Koreans and ruthlessly scrapping the inter-Korean agreements,"" the North said on Friday.

195,"The original Harry Ramsden's fish and chip shop at Guiseley near Leeds has been saved from permanent closure after being taken over by a competitor.  The Wetherby Whaler group is planning a £500,000 refurbishment of the site to add it to its chain of outlets.  The closure of the first Harry Ramsden restaurant was announced in November by former owner Boparan Ventures.  The Whaler group is to rename the business but hopes to keep the original fish and chip shop shed at the site.  Harry Ramsden's said when the closure was announced the brand was strong nationally, but was not immune to challenging economic conditions.  At the time, Harry Ramsden's chief executive Joe Teixeira said the Guiseley branch was making a loss and would need ""considerable investment"" before it could become profitable again.  Harry Ramsden's was bought by Birmingham businessman Ranjit Boparan, of Boparan Ventures Ltd, in January 2010.  There are currently 35 Harry Ramsden's restaurants in the UK, including the branch in Guiseley.  Phillip Murphy, one of the founders of the Wetherby Whaler group said: ""The famous fish and chip restaurant in Guiseley is the spiritual home of fish and chips in England.  ""It would be a national scandal if it were to close at this time of economic uncertainly.  ""Our investment has saved a Yorkshire landmark and will ensure the tradition of fine fish and chips continues at this important location.  ""The new Wetherby Whaler in Guiseley will be our flagship restaurant.  ""We expect it to recapture the atmosphere and flavours of Harry Ramsden's best years."""
196,"Hundreds of people had been taking part in a May Day protest over alleged corruption and illegal labour.  Police fired shots into the air and used dogs to try to disperse the marchers, as they veered off the route.  Protesters were complaining about the lack of local jobs due to an influx of cheap foreign labour caused by a recent boom in Macau's lucrative casino trade.  They accuse the government of turning a blind eye to the situation.  Some protesters carried signs saying, ""Severely punish employers of black market workers"", while others called for Macau's political leaders to stand down.  ""We are displeased with the labour crisis and the government's lack of action in dealing with it,"" said Ho Hen Kuok, president of the Macau Labour Union.  ""We don't want to see illegal labour being given jobs.""  ""The government is rich, the casinos are rich, but nobody is looking out for the Macau people,"" one marcher told the AFP news agency.  The protest turned violent as demonstrators tried to break through the police cordons lining their route.  Protesters surrounded one police vehicle and threw water bottles and placards at officers, who had boosted their lines with water cannons, the AFP reports.  Police also fired shots into the air, but it was not immediately clear if they had used blank or live rounds to disperse the crowds.  There were no reports of injuries, but several protesters were seen being led away by police.  Unlike nearby Hong Kong - another former European colony which was returned to China in the 1990s - such protests in Macau are uncommon.  Macau's population of 500,000 has a history of co-operation with the Beijing government.  The tiny territory has seen a surge in investment in recent years, with foreign gambling firms - mainly from the US - moving in to build new casino resorts.  Macau workers say that a resulting labour shortage in the territory has led many employers to hire cheap illegal labourers from mainland China."
197,"It is 200 years since Napoleon backtracked on his grand scheme to make his empire metric, but today the British remain unique in Europe by holding onto imperial weights and measures. With the UK's relationship with its neighbours under scrutiny, can it ever adopt the metric mindset?  It's an existential question that reveals much about how you make sense of the world. Is your ballpoint pen 6in long or 15cm?  Do you buy petrol by the gallon or the litre? Cheese by the ounce or the gram? And just how far is Dover from Calais - 21 miles or 34km?  Call it a proud expression of national identity or a stubborn refusal to engage with the neighbours. Either way, the persistent British preference for imperial over metric is particularly noteworthy at a time when its links with Europe are under greater scrutiny than ever.  Supporters of traditional weights and measures may have rejoiced in 2007 when the European Commission announced it was dropping its attempts to bring the UK into line with the rest of the EU.  But a looming anniversary is a reminder to decimal sceptics and enthusiasts alike that successful resistance to metrication is not always permanent.  In February 1812, some 17 years after France first went metric, Napoleon I introduced a system for small businesses called mesures usuelles - French for customary measurements. These were based on the old, pre-revolutionary system, in response to the unpopularity of the new decimal codes.  Only after Napoleon's departure did France go fully metric in 1840, using the law to enforce metrication.  But if the French eventually learned to think in units of 10, the UK, so far, has not. All the evidence suggests that, despite more than decade-and-a-half of goods being labelled in both metric and imperial, the British remain defiantly out of step with their counterparts across the channel.  In May 2011, a survey by supermarket chain Asda suggested 70% of customers found metric labelling confusing and wanted products labelled in imperial instead. In response, the company reverted to selling strawberries by the pound for the first time in over a decade.  According to social historian Joe Moran, author of Queuing For Beginners, the notion that imperial measures embody tradition and reassurance accounts for much of their appeal to the British.  ""It may also have something to do with the poetic, concrete names used in the old imperial system, particularly for coins - tanner, half a crown, guinea, etc, that just seem more familiar, friendly and native than metrics.""  Nonetheless, the legal requirement to display measurements for most products in both systems means many Britons have become adept at making the mental switch from ounces to grams and back again.  Nowhere is this duality more apparent than in relation to alcohol. Imperial measurements for spirits were phased out in 1988. Yet it remains illegal to sell beer and cider in any other units than pints.  It is a discrepancy that is reportedly mirrored in the illegal drugs market, with cannabis typically sold in ounces while cocaine is packaged in grams.  However, support for traditional measurements has gone beyond shoppers merely expressing a consumer preference.  In 2001, grocer Steve Thoburn became a cause celebre - if French terms are not inappropriate in this context - after being convicted for using scales showing only imperial weights. The Metric Martyr group's appeals against conviction were rejected all the way up to the House of Lords and, in February 2004, by the European Court of Human Rights.  Given the widespread association in the UK between the metric system and the European Union, it's tempting to view the battle simply as an expression of hostility towards political integration.  For one of the Metric Martyrs, Neil Herron, however, it was primarily concerned with how we understand the world around us.  ""It's about the language and vernacular with which we relate to each other,"" he says. ""Even with kids who have been educated in metric for the past 30 years, watching a football match talk about a penalty kick being 12 yards or the striker being six foot tall.  ""It goes to the core of who we are. If we are going to change we will do it organically, with the consent of the people. We won't have it imposed.""  Despite its popular identification with European bureaucracy, British attempts to scrap imperial measurements stretch back long before the UK came under the jurisdiction of Brussels.  In 1863 the House of Commons voted to mandate the metric system throughout the Empire, and in 1897 a parliamentary select committee recommended compulsory metrication within two years. In 1965 the Confederation of British Industry threw its weight behind the cause and the government set up the UK metrication board in 1969, four years before the UK joined the European Common Market.  Joining the community meant signing up to directives on standardised measurements, although the deadline for implementation was repeatedly pushed back. Since 1995, goods sold in Europe have had to be weighed or measured in metric, but the UK was temporarily allowed to continue using the imperial system.  This opt-out was due to expire in 2009, with only pints of beer, milk and cider and miles and supposed to survive beyond the cut-off. But ahead of the deadline, the European Commission admitted that persuading the British to accept grams over ounces was a lost cause, and shops could continue to label products in both systems.  To supporters of metric measures, it is a source of frustration that what they regard as a more logical mechanism has never achieved predominance.  Robin Paice of the UK Metric Association insists there is nothing intrinsically British about miles and pints and, for that matter, nothing inescapably foreign about kilometres and litres.  ""I don't believe things are hard-wired into the national mentality,"" he says.  ""The government has done very little to explain why it would be to the benefit of the UK to use the world's system. If people are asked to change the habits of a lifetime without explanation they are naturally quite reluctant. It's very much a failure of leadership.""  The UK may have the failure of Napoleon's armies to cross the channel to thank or blame for the resistance of imperial. But it is not the only country to fail to enthusiastically embrace metrication.  Japan's traditional shakkanho system was supposed to have been replaced by metric in 1924, but remained popular. It was forbidden in 1966 but is still used in agriculture.  And of course the US continues to weigh and measure in customary units, a system derived from imperial. According to Moran, the similarities between the two codes has served to reinforce UK Atlanticism.  ""Our residual attachment to imperial weights and measures is really to do with a resilient fact about our geo-political position: we are an island with one eye on America and an ambivalent attitude to the continent,"" he says.  ""In Britain the metric system has been associated with mainland Europe and also, since Napoleon, with European imperialism. The Americans used a set of weights and measures that was a variant on the imperial - and Americans coming over here in the war probably strengthened the sense that we had this in common.""  Switching between imperial and metric, the UK's approach to the issue may mirror the debate about its place in the world. But whichever way you measure it, the Channel isn't getting any larger or smaller."
198,"A bill which allows same-sex weddings to take place in Scotland has been passed by MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.  MSPs voted by 105 to 18 in favour of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill.  The Scottish government said the move was the right thing to do but Scotland's two main churches were opposed to it.  The first gay and lesbian weddings could take place this autumn.  Religious and belief bodies can ""opt in"" to perform same-sex marriages.  Ministers said no part of the religious community would be forced to hold such ceremonies in churches.  During a debate at Holyrood, MSPs rejected amendments which were said to provide ""protection"" for groups and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage.  The SNP's John Mason tabled an amendment stating that no-one could be ""compelled by any means"" to solemnise gay marriage, including by a contract or a legal requirement.  Gay and lesbian couples are allowed to marry in sixteen countries around the world. That includes England & Wales where the first same-sex weddings are due to take place at the end of March. In Scotland, the government says it wants ceremonies to become available ""as soon as possible"". The BBC understands that it will be October - at the earliest - before this happens. By the end of 2014, Northern Ireland is expected to be the only part of the UK that does not allow same-sex marriage. Critics fear the Scottish legislation could lead to those with a traditional view of marriage facing discrimination. But the Scottish government insists that freedom of expression is fully protected. It has yet to decide whether or not to open civil partnerships to mixed sex couples.  Mr Mason said that this was similar to a measure included in the bill passed by the UK Parliament allowing same-sex marriage in England and Wales.  Health Secretary Alex Neil insisted there were ""robust protections for religious bodies and celebrants"" in the bill and the amendment was unnecessary.  Mr Mason tabled further amendments, including one calling for recognition that ""a belief in marriage as a voluntary union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others for life is a belief worthy of respect in a democratic society"".  He said: ""This has been the prevailing view in Scotland for centuries, and may now be considered a minority view or even old fashioned, but it is an integral tenet of faith for many Christians, Muslims and others as well as the belief of many of no faith position at all.""  Mr Mason added: ""We have seen volunteers in the third sector removed from the board for publicly supporting traditional marriage.""  The first same-sex weddings in England and Wales will take place from 29 March, in the wake of legislation already passed by the Westminster parliament.  In Scotland, same-sex couples currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, but SNP ministers brought forward their Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill, saying the move was an important step for equality.  MSPs were allowed a free vote, rather than along party lines.  Mr Neil said passing the bill meant ""a historic day in the history of the Scottish Parliament"", which received the front-bench backing of Labour's Jackie Baillie and Conservative Jackson Carlaw.  Gay rights organisations, including the Equality Network and Stonewall Scotland, and a range of other groups, have supported the legislation.  But the Scottish Catholic Church and Church of Scotland oppose the move, and have said they have no plans to conduct same-sex marriages.  And the campaign group Scotland for Marriage said the safeguards in the bill did not go far enough.  Quakers have campaigned in favour of same-sex marriage and have said they would allow ceremonies to take place on their premises.  Other religious groups which back change include Buddhists and the Pagan Federation.  The Church of Scotland - whose ruling General Assembly last year voted to allow actively gay men and women to become ministers - has said the institution stood against homophobia, but added that the ""wide spread of opinion"" on gay marriage was reflected among members of congregations across the country.  As well as the main bill, Scottish ministers have also reached an agreement with the UK government for an amendment to the 2010 Equality Act.  The move aims to protect individual religious celebrants, who do not wish to conduct same-sex marriages, from the threat of court action claiming discrimination.  Westminster's Marriage Act which became law last July, will allow religious organisations to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales banned in law from doing so.  The Church of England, the Church in Wales and other faith groups have stated their opposition to gay marriage.  A report commissioned by the Church of England has recommended that members of the clergy should be allowed to offer blessings to same-sex couples.  The Northern Ireland Assembly is not currently considering any legislation to allow same-sex marriage.  The Scottish government's marriage bill was brought forward after a government consultation, which produced a record 77,508 responses."
199,"It will offer a ""basic shift manager"" course, training staff in skills such as human resources and marketing.  The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority said the company had been approved to develop courses up to the equivalent of A-level standard.  The QCA will also allow Network Rail and Flybe to award qualifications based on their workplace training schemes.  David Fairhurst, senior vice-president and chief people officer from McDonald's, said it was ""an important and exciting step"" for the company.  ""We want to ensure that our approach to recruitment, training, and development continues to create real opportunities for social mobility,"" he said.  Last year the company launched a campaign against the dictionary definition of a ""McJob"".

It has been given permission to develop courses equivalent to GCSEs and A-levels.  Airline Flybe will develop its ""airline trainer programme"" later this year and courses will cover everything from engineering to cabin crew training.  Skills Secretary John Denham said: ""It is right that we recognise and accredit employers that have shown a commitment to training and developing their staff.  ""This is an important step towards ending the old divisions between company training schemes and national qualifications, something that will benefit employees, employers and the country as a whole.""  Ken Boston, chief executive of the QCA, said the move recognised ""employers' commitment to training"".  He said: ""We look forward to considering further applications from employers to have their valuable work-related learning programmes validated."""
200,"Welsh clubs Swansea City and Cardiff City have been told by Uefa the only way they can qualify for Europe is by representing the English league.  Swansea and Cardiff are among six Welsh clubs in the English system and there had been uncertainty they could qualify for Europe via the English pyramid.  But both have been given assurances by European football's governing body.  Uefa's executive committee have ruled Welsh clubs in an English league cannot qualify for Europe via the Welsh Cup.  This means Swansea can play in Europe if they finish in the Premier League's Europa League places.  Uefa, though, did reject the Football Association of Wales' request to give their six exiled clubs a promise of European football through the Welsh Cup.  Uefa's two-day executive committee meeting in Istanbul has finally clarified that Swansea, Cardiff or any of the Welsh clubs would qualify for Europe should they finish high enough in the English top flight or by winning the FA or League Cups.  ""Welsh clubs, like Swansea and Cardiff, will be able to qualify for European competition through the English system,"" confirmed a Uefa spokesman.  The Swans are eighth in their first Premier League season, just 10 points behind fifth-placed Chelsea, while Cardiff were FA Cup finalists in 2008 as well as 2012 League Cup finalists.  Clubs that finish fifth in the Premier League will definitely qualify for the Europa League but if the FA Cup final is between two clubs in the top five, a sixth-place top-flight finish will then earn a Europa League spot.  Swansea could also earn Europa League qualification through the Fair Play League but only if the English league is in the top three national associations in the Uefa Fair Play ranking.  Tottenham Hotspur currently lead the Premier League's fair play table but if Spurs, who are third in the Premier League, qualify for the Champions League, a possible Europa League place would go to the team second in that table which is currently Swansea.  However, the Premier League seems unlikely to earn a Fair Play European place this season.  Uefa's ruling is a blow to the Welsh FA who wanted to offer Welsh clubs competing in the English league pyramid, also including Wrexham, Newport County, Colwyn Bay and Merthyr Town, the carrot of Europa League qualification to persuade them to play in the Welsh Cup.  but their participation in future Welsh Cups may now be in some doubt without the lure of European qualification.  Wrexham, winners of the Welsh Cup a record 23 times, beat Cardiff 2-1 in 1995 in the last Welsh Cup final involving Wales' English league clubs.  Wales' exiled clubs had been barred from entering the competition since 1995 when Uefa initially insisted only clubs from the Welsh league system were eligible to represent Wales in Europe.  ""We accept the decision and as an association we'll move on to strengthen the profile of the competition as it exists at the moment,"" said FAW spokesman Ian Gwyn Hughes.  ""I think everybody would accept since the likes of Cardiff and Swansea ceased playing in the Welsh Cup the profile has dropped.  ""But it's up to us as an association working with those clubs to improve the strength and the profile of the competition within the clubs that play in it."""
201,"Abdul Bacar Soihir told the BBC the aircraft had come from the archipelago's French island of Mayotte.  He accused the French government of not supporting the Comorian bid to remove Mohamed Bacar from power in Anjouan.  His comments came as African Union troops joined Comoran troops on Moheli for a proposed invasion of Anjouan.  Each of the Comoros federation's three islands has its own president, but Mr Bacar's re-election last July was declared illegal by the central authorities.  Observers say that a divided Comoros would benefit the French because it would weaken any claim for Mayotte, the fourth island in the archipelago, which is under French rule.  The BBC's Jonny Hogg in the federation's capital, Moroni, says the French embassy there has refused to respond to the accusations.  The helicopter, with three passengers aboard, crashed a few hundred yards offshore from Anjouan's capital, Moulsamoudou, on Wednesday.  The French government has only said that the helicopter was not a military aircraft and had been on mission to track illegal fishing in between Anjouan and Mayotte.  They say it crashed because of mechanical failure although there have been reports it was shot down by fighters loyal to Mr Bacar.  ""The helicopter came from Mayotte. Of course it was there to take Mohamed Bacar into exile,"" Mr Soihir, the cabinet chief, said.  ""The reason Mr Bacar has resisted for so long against the government and the AU is that he has French supporters who are protecting him.""  He said that Mr Bacar was being backed by unnamed private individuals on Mayotte.  ""Verbally they support us but the French, the South Africans and the Americans are false friends to the Comoros,"" he said.  South Africa has been pushing for a diplomatic solution and fresh elections to end the crisis, but Mr Soihir insisted an operation to capture the island would go ahead.  ""It is too late for dialogue. We've tried for a long time and it did not work, the only way now is to use force,"" he said."
202,"He has survived political correctness and the PlayStation generation. Now Mr Punch is about to celebrate his 350th birthday. What's the reason for his longevity?  With his familiar cry of ""That's the way to do it!"", Mr Punch has come a long way since his first mention in the diary of Samuel Pepys.  Next week, the squawking red-nosed prince of slapstick turns 350, with a big party in London's Covent Garden piazza.  It was here that Pepys recorded, on 9 May 1662, that he enjoyed ""an Italian puppet play that is within the rayles there, which is very pretty, the best that ever I saw...""  In Pepys' day, Mr Punch was a stringed marionette called Pulcinella, but he has evolved over the decades into the stick-wielding hand puppet now so familiar at summer fayres and seaside resorts.  ""Mr Punch is often misunderstood and misrepresented,"" says Glyn Edwards, the master puppeteer who is organising the birthday celebrations. ""He is a lord of misrule, he's not Jack the Ripper with a red nose.""  With a £240,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund , Mr Edwards' performing arts charity PuppetLink Ltd is organising The Big Grin - a nationwide celebration of Punch and Judy's place in popular culture.  The main event in Covent Garden on 12-13 May will be a birthday party attended by Punch and Judy enthusiasts from around the world.  Meanwhile, the V&A Museum of Childhood has commissioned an exhibition of photographic portraits by Tom Hunter of contemporary Punch practitioners - known as ""Professors"" - pictured with their booths.  And Brighton Fishing Museum will open a permanent Punch and Judy display on the site where shows have been given since the 1830s.  So how has Mr Punch managed to make it into the 21st Century?  ""Mr Punch has been seen by every monarch since Charles II,"" says Mr Edwards. ""He's had to keep in tune with the social climate.""  Comedy routines that would have been enjoyed by the Victorians - such as one involving a hangman getting hanged - have disappeared as public tastes have changed.  ""It's a classic piece of gallows humour,"" says Mr Edwards, ""but we don't do it any more because people don't understand it as a topical joke.""  These days Mr Punch is more likely to have youth crime and the financial crisis on his agenda.  ""When Judy refers to the baby as little Asbo it gets a laugh,"" says Mr Edwards, who has also introduced a new character called Mr Bonus the Banker.  He also has a health and safety officer - complete with a clipboard and hi-viz jacket - who ends up in Mr Punch's sausage machine.  While Punch and Judy have faced criticism that they are too violent for children - in 2004 a council in Cornwall banned a show following complaints that it promoted domestic violence - Mr Punch and friends look set to thrive in the new millennium.  ""He's an English icon,"" says Mr Edwards. ""I know from personal experience that there isn't a Punch and Judy act that's not booked over the Jubilee period. At times of national holidays, Mr Punch is regarded as someone who ought to be there.""  The art of live puppetry in general has gained a high profile after the success of stage shows like War Horse and Avenue Q.  ""We all live in Mr Punch's shadow and what a strange shadow it is,"" laughs Mervyn Millar, UK director of Handspring - the puppet company behind War Horse, which is soon to unveil a new show Crow based on the poems of Ted Hughes.  ""As soon as I started working with puppets I made myself a Punch because there's something about his physiognomy and his spirit that is so compelling.  ""It's delightful to see so much anarchic and socially irresponsible energy in a tiny little thing the size of a person's hand.""  He adds: ""It reminds us that puppetry can represent anything. It can be dangerous and exciting and satirical. It also reminds us that children will happily watch all that stuff if you don't tell them that they can't.""  While Punch and Judy professors tend to remain hidden within their booths, other puppeteers have turned that concept inside out.  Canadian Jeff Achtem, whose show Swamp Juice is currently at the Soho Theatre ahead of a UK tour, is a shadow puppeteer who makes a point of being visible to his audience.  The performer, who describes Swamp Juice as ""Dr Seuss meets South Park with a 3D finale"", didn't see his first Mr Punch show until he was in his early 20s.  ""What interested me was that it was theatre in the streets that was challenging authority,"" he says with reference to Mr Punch's regular run-ins with the policeman and the devil.  ""The magic of puppetry is that there's this indescribable phenomenon where the audience suspends disbeliefs and permits the puppets to be alive. The other lovely thing about puppets is that they tend to overact a lot.""  The 350th anniversary of Mr Punch is a reminder of the puppet's ancient roots, says Glyn Edwards.  ""Mr Punch isn't just a Victorian construct. There are ancient sources that have been dragged into Punch and Judy.  ""The idea of having a devil in the show is as old as English drama itself. The whole thing is a complicated kaleidoscope of influences.""  As he makes final preparations for next week's birthday party, Mr Edwards admits that his favourite definition of Punch and Judy came from a bemused audience member.  The woman, having had the show explained to her by a Punch and Judy man, summed it up thus: ""Oh, so it's English nonsense descended from Italian nonsense!""  The Big Grin 350th birthday events take place 12-13 May in Covent Garden Piazza, London. The Happy Birthday, Mr Punch exhibition at the V&A Museum of Childhood runs 14 July - 9 December. Other events around the country are listed on The Big Grin website."
203,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Forty years ago on Saturday, one of the pop world's most famous and imitated album covers was shot in an ordinary-looking street in north London. The idea for the cover of the Beatles' Abbey Road album was initially to call it Everest, after the favourite brand of cigarettes smoked by their engineer Geoff Emerik. Then the thought of doing a Himalayan cover helped kill the idea, and instead they considered doing the shoot closer to home. ""There's a sketch Paul McCartney did with four little stick men crossing the zebra,"" says Brian Southall, author of the history of Abbey Road Studios. ""It gave a pretty good idea of what they wanted."" On 8 August 1969 the Fab Four walked out of No 3 Abbey Road, having finished basic work on what would be their penultimate album. A policeman held up the traffic, the band walked back and forth a few times and that was that    The photographer who took the famous cover shot was the late Iain Macmillan, a close friend of Brian Southall's, who knew the Beatles through working with Yoko Ono. ""He was given about 15 minutes,"" says Mr Southall. ""He stood up a stepladder while a policeman held up the traffic, the band walked back and forth a few times and that was that."" He took only seven or eight pictures, now in the Apple archive, but they're fascinating for their difference from the end product we all know. Most striking is the one of the band walking in the opposite direction (right to left), caught mid-stride in different poses. It looks all wrong of course, and draws attention to the accidental symmetry - despite Paul being out of step - of the final cover shot with its pattern of four firm inverted V shapes. In one of the alternative takes Paul McCartney is wearing sandals he kicked off during the shoot. This matters if you remember how the album cover was taken as evidence for the conspiracy theories that ""Paul is Dead."" Conspiracy theories abounded following Paul's barefoot appearance on the cover Barefooted, out of step, the car number plate behind him referring to his age - 28 if he'd lived - the Beatles forming a funeral procession for him. George was cast as the gravedigger, Ringo the undertaker, and John the priest. Years later in 1993, the very much alive Paul McCartney would spoof the cover and the rumours for his ""Paul is Live"" concert album. A lesser noted curiosity is that the album cover has no writing on it and is just the picture. That is thanks to John Kosh, who at the time, was creative director at Apple. ""I insisted we didn't need to write the band's name on the cover,"" he says. ""They were the most famous band in the world after all - EMI said they'd never sell any albums if we didn't say who the band was, but I got my way, and got away with it."" And it is hard to think of an album cover that has been so thoroughly repeated. Dozens of bands have put stripes on their cover, like the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, but of course the biggest tribute comes from the thousands of fans and tourists who go to leafy north London every year. I come here all the time and its always been the same... all they're doing is posing on the crossing    If you want to check the crossing now, there's a webcam. Watch it for a while and you will see scampering fans snatching at a gap in the traffic to recreate the shoot - much to the annoyance of local drivers. One black taxi cabbie, Ron, who also used to drive a bus down Abbey Road, told the BBC World Service: ""I come here all the time and it's always been the same - it really does annoy you. ""All they're doing is posing on the crossing. Someone's going to get mown down one of these days, there's no doubt about it."" Here's hoping Ron avoids the crossing on Saturday morning when Beatles fans will stage a mass crossing in honour of the photo shoot. It is not known how many of those fans are injured on the crossing every year. But the council have to repaint the wall next to the crossing every three months to cover over fans' graffiti. And the Abbey Road street sign has now been mounted out of reach up a wall, so often has it been defaced or stolen. If there was a way to steal the stripes off the zebra you can bet Beatles fans would have taken them too. Or maybe they haven't thanks to the rumour that the famous crossing you now see isn't actually the original and has been moved for safety reasons. And who would want to steal the wrong zebra crossing?     "
204,"Two gay men who have been a couple for 14 years have become the first to register to marry in Uruguay, hours after a law came into force allowing same-sex marriages in the country.  Rodrigo Borda, 39, and Sergio Miranda, 45, said it was a day of much joy and emotion, but also of responsibility.  President Jose Mujica signed the legislation in May, but it took 90 days to come into effect.  Uruguay is the second South American nation to pass a gay-marriage law.  Mr Borda and Mr Miranda said they would celebrate their wedding in September.  It would be a ""very public affair"", not only because they wanted to share the moment with ""all the world"", but also because they wanted ""to give an example to those gay couples who may be thinking about getting married but don't dare to"", the couple added.  Three years ago, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to allow same-sex marriages.  Since then, Brazil's Supreme Court overwhelmingly voted in favour of granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as married heterosexuals, effectively authorising gay marriage.  In Colombia, a judge recently ordered a notary to sign a document which - while not a marriage certificate - in effect gave a same-sex couple the same rights as a heterosexual one.  In Mexico, legislation on same-sex unions is a matter for individual states. Gay marriage is legal in the capital and the southern state of Quintana Roo, while the states of Coahuila and Colima allow gay couples to enter into civil unions. Gay marriage remains illegal in the rest of the country.  The gay-marriage bill is among a series of liberal reforms in Uruguay backed by President Mujica.  Since the left-wing politician came to power, parliament has also passed a law allowing abortion beyond cases of rape, incest or threats to a woman's health.  Last week, the House of Representatives voted in favour of a bill which, if passed by the Senate, will legalise marijuana and put its production and sale into the hands of the state."
205,"Among the shows being scrapped are Today With Des And Mel, Celebrity Fit Club and drama Rosemary and Thyme.  In a speech to the Royal Television Society, ITV director of TV Simon Shaps said the channel was undertaking ""painful, but utterly necessary"" steps.  He described it as ITV's ""clause IV moment"", referring to Tony Blair's reinvention of the Labour party.  Mr Shaps, who was appointed to the role in September 2005, said he wanted ITV to ""take more risks"".  He said he also agreed with some of the criticisms levelled at ITV and admitted the network ""largely missed"" the revolution in lifestyle programming.  He said: ""We are undertaking a painful, but utterly necessary, process - a kind of clause IV moment for ITV - which is to drop programmes which, by the criteria of most of our competitors, are still performing incredibly well.  ""Why? Because we know that that volume without value is no longer enough.  ""Value in terms of viewer engagement, value in terms of audience profile, value in terms of word of mouth and the perception of the channel.""  Mr Shaps added he wanted ITV to spend its annual £300m drama budget on ""contemporary, less predictable"" work.  He called on writers and producers to start thinking about ITV as a place that ""wants more than cop shows and period detectives"".  Des O'Connor and co-host Melanie Sykes were told earlier this week that their afternoon show was among those facing the chop.  An ITV1 spokeswoman said: ""Des and Mel have done a fantastic job and we're very grateful.  ""The daytime schedule is being overhauled and we have some exciting new programmes lined up."""
206,"They include a man who says he was responsible for Mirwais Sadeq's death, a senior member of the Herat provincial government told the BBC.  Mr Sadeq was the son of the governor of Herat, Ismail Khan, one of Afghanistan's most powerful figures.  The central government has been deploying soldiers to the area.  Soon after Sunday's killing, fighting broke out between rival factions.  The BBC's Crispin Thorold says the city is now calm.  The government has been sending more members of the Afghan National Army (ANA) to Herat, but they have not yet started patrols within the city.  As the official mourning period for Mirwais Sadeq continues in Herat, regional and national leaders are meeting to try to resolve the political fall-out from the minister's death.  Our correspondent says it is not clear how Ismail Khan will react to the efforts of the central government to deploy the army.  Mr Khan has until now enjoyed a great deal of autonomy in the west of Afghanistan.  Deputy Defence Minister General Rahim Wardak has warned that Kabul would ask Ismail Khan to give up his weapons.  He has said that the ANA is the only legitimate force in the country, and no-one would be allowed to have personal armies.  Meanwhile sources in Herat say that at least 13 people died in fighting which broke out after the killing of Mr Sadeq on Sunday between troops loyal to Ismail Khan and a senior local military commander, Zahir Nayebzada.  Earlier reports said that around 100 people died in the clashes.  Mr Khan proclaimed his son a martyr at his burial in Herat on Wednesday, and demanded that the government find his killers.  He blames his son's death on forces belonging to Mr Nayebzada, who have now fled the city."
207,"Turkish forces have been fighting Kurdish rebels in a 25-year conflict Opposition parties in Turkey have delayed the government's announcement of its plan to end a conflict in the mainly Kurdish south-east. Interior Minister Besir Atalay ran out of time to present the measures in parliament as nationalist MPs jeered. The plans are thought to include some Kurdish language education, restoring Kurdish place names and more freedom to use Kurdish in election campaigns. The announcement is now expected on Thursday. Some 40,000 people have been killed in the 25-year Kurdish fight for autonomy. The government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has recently been seeking opposition support for a negotiated settlement to end the insurgency by the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). It first announced the plan three months ago but has yet to publicise details. The issue is very sensitive in Turkey, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Istanbul. The PKK has been vilified as a terrorist organisation, so making peace is a delicate task for the government. Nationalist sentiment is so strong in Turkey that until recently there was no official recognition of a separate Kurdish identity, our correspondent says, despite the fact that as much as 20% of the population is made up of ethnic Kurds, many of whom speak Kurdish as their first language. Last month Turkey's government was caught off guard when a group of PKK fighters crossed the border from Iraq and announced they wanted to lay down their arms. They were not prosecuted as previous returnees have been, but the euphoric welcome they received from thousands of local Kurds provoked a nationalist backlash. While the government package is expected to allow much greater freedom to use the Kurdish language, the government is almost certain to refuse the request for a general amnesty made by the PKK and its supporters, our correspondent says. Abdullah Ocalan, the PKK leader, has been in jail since 1999. In recent years, Turkish warplanes have launched numerous attacks on rebel hideouts in the autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan region, from where Ankara says some 2,000 PKK guerrillas stage hit-and-run attacks on Turkish territory.     "
208,"US playwright Arthur Miller has been convicted of contempt of Congress.  The conviction relates to an investigation last year by the House of Representatives' Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) into a Communist conspiracy to misuse American passports.  During the investigation 41-year-old Mr Miller, who is married to Hollywood movie star Marilyn Monroe, refused to reveal the names of alleged Communist writers with whom he had attended five or six meetings in New York in 1947.  He was said to be co-operative in all other aspects of the hearing but told the committee his conscience would not permit him to give the names of others and bring possible trouble to them.  The guilty verdict was announced in a 15-page ""opinion"" today by Federal Judge McLaughlin who presided over a six-day trial, which ended last week.  During the trial Mr Miller's counsel, Joseph Rauh, had claimed that the questions his client had refused to answer had no reasonable connection with a passports inquiry.  He argued that the committee had simply wanted to expose the playwright and that ""exposure for exposure's sake"" was illegal.  But Judge McLaughlin found that HUAC did have a valid legislative purpose in looking into the passport regulations and that Mr Miller had indeed experienced his own difficulties in obtaining a passport from the State Department.  The trial was told by the government that Mr Miller had joined the Communist party in 1943 but this was denied by the defendant who said that to the best of his belief he had never been a party member.  He did, however say that ""there were two short periods - one in 1940 and one in 1947 - when I was sufficiently close to Communist Party activities so that someone might honestly have thought that I had become a member"".  Mr Miller was not in court when the guilty verdict was announced. The maximum punishment for contempt of Congress is one year in jail, a fine of £357 or both.  No date was fixed for sentencing but it is understood the case will automatically go to appeal.  After the trial Mr Miller, who will remain on bail pending the next legal step, said through a spokesman: ""I have no comment to make, nor has my wife.""  The case is now bound to call into question the whole system of Congressional inquiries and their impingement on individual rights."
209,"Earlier, a minute's silence took place at Old Trafford at 1504 GMT, timed to coincide with the moment of the crash 50 years ago when 23 peope were killed.  There was a simultaneous service at the crash site in Germany.  A period of silence also took place at the home games involving Northern Ireland and Wales.  Eight Manchester United players were killed in the crash and the service at Old Trafford saw Sir Bobby Charlton - one of the survivors - present.  A thousand people were also inside Old Trafford's Manchester Suite for the memorial service, with many more outside on Sir Matt Busby Way where a clock commemorates the events of 6 February, 1958.  The ceremony was led by United's club chaplain the Reverend John Boyers and included speeches by Charlton and Harry Gregg as well as a message from Prince Charles.  As well as the service in Manchester, at which Charlton and Gregg were joined by fellow survivors Albert Scanlon, Bill Foulkes and Kenny Morgans, there was another ceremony in Munich.  The three sons of owner Malcolm Glazer were also present.  Charlton paid tribute to those that lost their lives, saying: ""The team that was decimated in Munich would, I think, have been the first British team to win the European Cup.""  At 1330 GMT, an English-speaking Catholic priest conducted a religious ceremony at the crash site in Trudering, attended by a group of 400 fans, who left scarves and hung flags at the site.  The names of the dead were read out, along with the lyrics to The Flowers of Manchester, a song penned after the disaster as a tribute to the dead.  Bayern Munich chairman Karl Heinz Rummenigge was among those to address the mourners.  ""February 6, 1958 was a black day in the history of Manchester United, but also for football in general,"" Rummenigge said.  ""I'm proud to be a fan of Manchester United. People in England say God save the Queen. Today, I say God save Manchester United.""  On a day of commemoration at Old Trafford, the centrepiece was the unveiling at 1645 GMT of a free, permanent exhibition of the Busby Babes in the South Stand tunnel, now renamed the Munich Tunnel.  The exhibition was unveiled by Roger Bryne Jnr, whose father, Roger Byrne, died in the crash, and Manchester United chief executive David Gill.  England and United defender Rio Ferdinand says he hopes supporters at Wembley will remain silent in tribute to the people who died.  ""I'm sure the fans will respect it - it's a poignant moment and we've got fantastic fans in this country,"" said Ferdinand.  ""It's not just about Manchester United, it's about English football too.""  Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live on Wednesday, Gill said: ""That day 50 years ago is still very clear in the minds of the family and friends of those who died.""  On Sunday, there will be another minute's silence prior to United's home Premier League game against Manchester City.  Former City goalkeeper Frank Swift - then working as a journalist - also died in the crash and Gill says he is confident the City fans will fall silent in tribute.  ""We've been working closely with City and discussed it with them. Frank Swift was one of their greatest goalkeepers and we've talked to them about the plans for the day,"" said Gill.  ""We're working to ensure they remember that it wasn't just Manchester United, it was the city of Manchester that was affected and it was the world of football that was affected.  ""We hope and believe that the minute's silence will be observed appropriately.""  United players will wear a 1950s-style kit, free from sponsorship and numbered one to 11, while City will also wear a special strip."
210,"To celebrate the movie's 30th anniversary here are 30 facts and figures related to the film which influenced a new generation of film-makers.  1. The first trailer for the film hit cinemas six months before it was to open - with tag lines such as ""the story of a boy, a girl and a universe"" and ""a billion years in the making"" - as executives hoped to drum up some interest in a film they had little faith in.  3. It was originally called The Star Wars, but ""the"" was dropped fairly early on in the creative process.  4. The full title Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope first appeared when the film was re-released in 1981.  5. Director George Lucas originally had a contract with Fox for $150,000 (£75,941) for writing and directing Star Wars. But he cannily insisted on total control and 40% of merchandising - something the studio agreed to because they had no idea of what a phenomenon Star Wars would become.  6. The famous - and often imitated - opening crawl for Star Wars was co-written by Brian De Palma, the director of Scarface. It begins ""It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.""  7. Sir Alec Guinness made a ton of money from the film having recognised its potential success and negotiating a deal for two per cent of box office takings. He also refused to do any promotional work for the film.  8. Anthony Daniels as C-3PO and Kenny Baker, who played R2-D2, are the only actors credited with being in all six Star Wars films.  9. Harrison Ford was far from George Lucas' first choice to play Han Solo as the director had wanted completely new faces for Star Wars. Ford had already starred in Lucas' American Graffiti.  10. The original release date was set for Christmas 1976 but major delays in filming saw it pushed back. The Fox studio had threatened to close down production when filming over-ran by more than two weeks.  11. Ralph McQuarrie created the paintings which were used to illustrate how the Star Wars universe could look. He started out as a technical illustrator for Boeing.  12. The Wookiee Chewbacca was inspired by George Lucas' beloved dog Indiana - an Alaskan malamute.  13. Lucas once said that the shape of the Millennium Falcon was based on a hamburger.  14. George Lucas based the character of Han Solo on his friend Francis Ford Coppola.  15. The droids R2-D2 and C-3PO are said to be based on the 1958 Akira Kourosawa film Kakushi toride no san akunin (The Hidden Fortress). Other characters in Star Wars were also drawn from the film including Han Solo and Ben Kenobi.  16. Cinemas in the US were press-ganged into buying the film after few took up the option, with the threat that they wouldn't get The Other Side of Midnight - a widely-anticipated adaptation of a Sidney Sheldon novel. The Other Side of Midnight, starring Susan Sarandon, was a box office flop.  17. Publicity supervisor Charles Lippincott was aware of the power of the sci-fi fan, going along to conventions to talk about Star Wars and what audiences could expect. He was largely credited with bringing in huge opening day audiences.  18. The merchandise for the film was not in place to accommodate the demand for the first Christmas rush after the film's release. Lucas and merchandise company Kenner Toys hit upon a novel idea with the introduction of early bird certificate boxes. These were basically empty boxes that promised the receiver they would get the figures once they had been made. They sold for $16 at the time and the actual figures arrived two months later. Limited edition packs were re-released in 2005.  19. More than 250 million small action figures were shipped in the eight years after the first film, going to countries across the world. In the first year alone 42m were sold.  20. Composer John Williams won an Oscar for his score for Star Wars. The music was later named by the American Film Institute as the greatest film score of all time.  21. A New Hope was the only one of the six films in the franchise to be nominated in the Academy Awards best picture category. It lost out to Woody Allen's Annie Hall.  22. Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker, was involved in a car accident following primary shooting. His face was damaged making reshoots impossible. Hamill later said he only broke his nose and reports that his face was reconstructed were wide of the mark.  23. Anthony Daniels was injured during his first outing as C-3PO when a leg piece fell off his gold-coloured costume and shattered - stabbing him in the foot.  24. On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia, the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years and a rest day had to be called.  25. When filming moved to Elstree it was hoped the earlier problems encountered in the desert would be finished. But a new problem arose in the shape of the strict British working conditions adhered to on set. Lucas says that filming had to close at 5.30pm on the dot, unless he was in the middle of a shot - when he could ask workers to stay for an extra 15 minutes.  26. One of the most famous bloopers from the film is when stormtroopers burst into a room and one of them hits his head on the door frame. Fans of Star Wars and the blooper have spotted hundreds of ""mistakes"" throughout the Star Wars franchise but many can only be spotted by the most eagle-eyed viewer.  27. Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca, worked as a hospital orderly in London before being cast as the Wookiee. He was said to have got into character by copying the mannerisms of animals he visited at the zoo.  28. David Prowse, the 6ft 7ins actor who plays Darth Vader, had problems filming lightsaber scenes as he kept breaking the poles that were used as stand-ins for the weapons. In the sequels, fight co-ordinator Bob Anderson stepped into the costume to film the lightsaber scenes.  29. George Lucas wanted his sets to look worn and scuffed but the studio cleaning service continually cleaned and tidied up after a day's filming - much to the director's dismay.  30. Lucas' stress levels reached such a height that he thought he was having a heart attack. He was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and told to rest - something the punishing schedule would not allow."
211,"A former Army major has told the Saville Inquiry he was satisfied there was a clear gap between rioters and civil rights marchers when the Parachute Regiment was sent into the Bogside area on Bloody Sunday.  However, Major Michael Steele said he did not know how many people were still between the marchers and the rioters.  On 30 January 1972 paratroops opened fire on civilians at a civil rights march in the Bogside in Londonderry killing 13 people. Another man died later.  Major Steele, who passed the orders on the day, was giving evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday.  In 1972 he was working as deputy to the overall Army commander, Brigadier Pat McLellan, and he passed on the brigadier's order for paratroops to go after rioters in the Bogside.  He said the situation was never going to be perfect and that he never believed the area would be completely empty.  Major Steele, who was being fed information from the Army helicopter over the scene, said there was ""wide"" separation"" by the time he passed on the order to move in from Major General MacLellan.  ""There was, in my estimation, a situation where the brigadier's separation between marchers and hooligans had been achieved.""  Major General MacLellan had been seeking a clear split between rioters and marchers at Free Derry Corner, a distance of about 400 metres.  There were also some rioters at Barrier 14 at this point, the inquiry was told.  Major Steele said he had no information on how many people were in Rossville Street, which links the two points and was where the soldiers advanced.  Lord Saville, the inquiry chairman, said it could be viewed that separation had been achieved because rioters and marchers were in different areas.  He said it would then be necessary to mount an arrest operation which did not destroy that separation.  Major Steele said that is why his commanding officer ""very sensibly"" added the demand that there be no running battle to the order - something which had not been previously discussed.  The Saville Inquiry was set up by Prime Minister Tony Blair to reinvestigate the evidence because the relatives felt the first inquiry was a whitewash.  Lord Saville and the Commonwealth judges who comprise the inquiry, are not expected to report back until 2004.  The inquiry is currently hearing the evidence from military witnesses in London."
212,"Gun crime in London is increasing so rapidly that police fear they may not have the resources to cope, the BBC has learned. Members of the Metropolitan Police's SO19 firearms unit say lack of staff, money and out-of-date equipment is threatening to affect their work. The BBC's Zubeida Malik says that at a meeting this week, officers reported there had been a 100% increase in firearms-related crime in the capital this year. This follows the publication of Home Office figures last month which showed that violent crime in England and Wales was continuing to rise.    These criminals out there are very well equipped    The London Borough of Lambeth had the highest rate of robberies. The borough was the focus of attention just over two weeks ago when police shot dead 29-year-old Derek Bennett - he was brandishing a gun-shaped cigarette lighter. Officers serving in SO19 told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that recruitment to the unit had dropped dramatically, and that the pressures of the job were taking a toll on members. The firearms unit deals with between 20 and 30 incidents a day. Its members say they deal with criminals whose weapons are more sophisticated than theirs, and who even wear body armour. Scotland Yard said this week than police in London may be issued with electric stun guns to defend themselves from violent criminals. The ""taser"" gun, which uses an electrical shock to cause temporarily paralysis, could be introduced by the end of the year. One SO19 officer told Today that when he joined the unit in 1995 there had been 750 applications, compared with just 120 last year. He said the unit needed more money to cope with the rise in violent crime.    I think we're coping at the moment, but we mustn't be complacent    ""We need more personnel in the long term if we're going to keep up with things, but that's again a difficult matter, because of the fact we're not getting the people that want to join the department as we used to,"" he said ""We must keep up-to-date with our equipment, and I don't mean just firearms, but the equipment we use in other instances, for example opening doors, all sorts of things. ""If we're going to fight crime in London, and believe me, these criminals out there are very well equipped themselves, we need to be one step ahead. ""I think we're coping at the moment, but we mustn't be complacent. ""I would hate to think that we haven't got the correct resources and enough resources to deal with that crime that's going on there, because at the end of the day the buck stops with SO19 - there is no one else to deal with the gun crime in London."" Lord Mackenzie, former head of the Police Superintendents' Association, told the Today programme that the number of armed police should be increased to deal with the rise in gun-related crime. He added that officers needed to be ""given confidence"" to use firearms. ""We pride ourselves in being unarmed but what we've got to do, obviously, is to give our officers the best training, the best equipment, and of course give them confidence,"" he said."
213,"Knopfler was riding a Honda motorbike when he was involved in a collision with a Fiat Punto car on Monday.  The 53-year-old singer and guitarist suffered a broken collar bone and six broken ribs in the accident which happened in London's smart Belgravia district in mid-morning traffic.  A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: ""Police were called by a member of the public at 10.49am yesterday to reports of a road traffic collision in Grosvenor Road, London SW1, near the junction with Claverton Street.  ""It is believed a red Fiat Punto motor car was in collision with a Honda motorcycle.""  Knopfler was taken by ambulance to St Thomas' Hospital in central London where he was treated for his injuries.  A hospital spokesman said he was in a stable condition and had been discharged from the hospital by 6pm.  The car's female driver was unhurt in the crash, police said.  Knopfler enjoyed a string of hits with 1980s group Dire Straits including Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing.  The band is probably best known for its album Brothers in Arms, which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide.  Knopfler has also written the soundtrack to five films, including The Princess Bride and Local Hero.  He is due to begin a European concert tour in April.  Other celebrities who have suffered recent motorcycle crashes include Liam Neeson, who suffered a broken pelvis after crashing into a deer near his New York state home in July 2000.  Keanu Reeves nearly died after falling off his motorbike in 1997. He spent several weeks on crutches."
214,"Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been diagnosed with throat cancer.  The 66-year-old has a tumour in his larynx, a statement from the Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo said.  ""After multiple investigations, initial chemotherapy will start in the next few days. The patient is well,"" the statement read.  Lula was elected Brazil's president in 2002, the country's first leftist leader in half a century.  He was re-elected for a second term in 2006, and left office in December 2010 with record approval ratings.  A former union leader, Lula presided over a period of strong economic growth in Brazil during which millions of people were lifted out of poverty.  It was widely reported, in March 2010, that Lula had given up smoking after 50 years."
215,"UK handheld computer maker Psion has announced plans to buy Canadian wireless network and software developer, Teklogix, for £242m.  The acquisition is designed to strengthen Psion's position in wireless communications, which allows internet access through mobile phones and other handheld devices.  ""It is the core technology we need,"" said Psion chief executive David Levin.  ""Teklogix brings with it critical local wireless integration skills,"" he said.  Under the deal, Psion will combine Teklogix with its Psion Enterprise operations, which focus on the development of handheld devices.  Mr Levin said one of the deal's main assets was the two companies' knowledge of new wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth and the 802.11 radio frequency standard, which provide wireless connections between phones and other electronic devices.  He said: ""Teklogix brings a very rich understanding of the 802.11 standard, and Psion is engaged in Bluetooth. The inter-operation of these technologies is crucial to what this deal is about. It gives us a particular edge.""  He also said the deal should not be considered as a pure move by Psion into the North American market.  ""Teklogix happens to be based in North America but half its sales are not in America. This is about core technologies, and our acquisition of a high-growth, highly profitable company in its own right,"" he said.  Psion will pay for Teklogix through a mixture of cash and share swaps, with its offer price representing a 41% premium over Teklogix's closing share price of £11.32 (C$24.90) on Tuesday.  Shareholders can take up to £100m in cash and the rest in shares.  In order to shield investors from volatility in the technology sector and in Psion's share price, investors will receive fewer Psion shares if the price rises but more if the shares fall.  Psion's shares have fluctuated between 400p and 1,560p since early March.  On Tuesday morning, they were trading about 2.3% lower at 650p.  Mr Levin did not rule out further acquisitions by Psion in the future, but said the company would currently be concentrating on completing the Teklogix deal.  ""We will focus very heavily to make it work but to keep looking at further opportunities,"" he said.  In the year to 31 December 1999, Psion had sales of £150m and pre-tax profit of £5m.  Teklogix had revenues of £95m (C$209m) and pre-tax profit of £15m (C$33m) in the year to 31 March, 2000."
216,"David Copeland wanted his bombing campaign to ignite a race war across Britain. But while he was fueled by right-wing extremism and has even been photographed with one of the most senior figures in its political movement, he acted alone. The 24-year-old's first two bombs were aimed at the black community in Brixton, south London, and the Asian community in Brick Lane, east London. The final one was planted at the busy Admiral Duncan pub in Soho, central London, where the clientele was predominantly gay. Copeland was brought up in Yately in Hampshire; his father an engineer and mother a part-time helper in a centre for the handicapped. At school he was small for his age and is said to have resented it, gaining the nickname ""Mr Angry"". He left secondary school with a few low-grade GCSE's and began drinking and taking drugs, including heroin. This was followed by convictions for assault. Copeland never had a girlfriend and it was his great fear that people thought him gay. By 1997 when he moved to London to work on the Jubilee line extension as an engineer's assistant, he had become homophobic and racist. He joined the extremist BNP and became an activist. In 1997 he was photographed standing next to the party's founder John Tyndall. His father, Stephen Copeland, believes others led his son astray. ""I just believe he was easily influenced by people who saw they could indoctrinate him with their views. I just don't believe he went looking for it himself,"" he says. While in the BNP David Copeland found information on the internet on how to make bombs from fireworks. He also read racist and anti-Semitic literature from extreme right wing Christian groups in America. He moved back to Hampshire at the end of 1998 and joined a small Nazi organisation, the National Socialist Movement. He became its regional unit's leader just a few weeks before his bombing campaign. Copeland was caught largely because he had wandered around Brixton for more than an hour before planting his first bomb. It is an area heavily covered by CCTV and after trawling through thousands of hours of tape, police singled him out, enhanced the pictures and released them in a public appeal. The crucial tip-off to police came from Copeland's workmate, Paul Mifsud. ""I saw the paper and the bag and something hit me. I saw the picture again, I picked it up and looked at it and something hit me, I though 'that looks like David,"" he said. The name David Copeland did not appear on any MI5 or police special branch database and when unarmed police finally went to his room in Farnborough, they were astonished to find a Nazi shrine. The walls were decorated with swastika flags and photos of atrocities and bombings from around the world, including some from his own bombings at Brixton and Brick Lane, what he called his ""handiwork"". There were also explosives and weaponry, a crossbow at the ready, hunting knives and a lethal gas-powered pistol. Asked by police the next day why he attacked blacks and Asians he replied: ""Because I don't like them, I want them out of this country, I'm a national socialist, Nazi, whatever you want to call me, I believe in the master race."" Despite his right-wing connections, Copeland said he acted alone in his bombing campaign. He craved fame and notoriety, but in his confession to police he made it clear that his aim was political. ""My main intent was to spread fear, resentment and hatred throughout this country, it was to cause a racial war,"" he told detectives. ""There'd be a backlash from the ethnic minorities, I'd just be the spark that would set fire to this country."" While on remand in prison and at Broadmoor special hospital, Copeland wrote to BBC correspondent Graeme McLagan. He denied that he was schizophrenic. He also revealed his racist obsessions - writing that what he called ""Zog"", the Zionist Occupation Government, was trying to sweep him under the carpet by pumping him full of drugs. ""The Jew, devil's disciples and peoples of mud must be driven out of our land,"" he wrote. ""It is God's law and we must obey. ""I would have bombed the Jews as well if I'd got a chance."" The courts have ensured that he never will."
217,"Guernsey firm Healthspan has announced it is launching a legal challenge to the UK's decision to end VAT relief on Channel Island goods.  Derek Coates, the group's chief executive, said: ""We are in the process of launching a legal challenge, perhaps in the form of a judicial review.""  He said it followed advice from accountants and UK lawyers and would be pursued ""on the basis of discrimination against the Channel Islands"".  The tax relief is to end on 1 April.  The abolition of Low Value Consignment Relief - or LVCR - was announced by the UK treasury earlier.  LVCR allows companies to send goods below a certain value to the UK without having to pay sales tax. That value was lowered from £18 to £15 on 1 November, a decision made on 23 March.  The relief was set up in the 1980s with the intention of reducing the cost of collecting trivial amounts of the tax.  Mr Coates, whose company sells health supplements from Guernsey, said the decision was ""not wholly unexpected"".  However, he said: ""What is surprising and disturbing for all the Channel Islands is the way the UK have treated our islands with such disdain.  ""They have taken no steps to stop LVCR imports from any other country outside the EU including Switzerland, Cyprus, Hong Kong, the USA or China.""  Mr Coates said it was likely that the group's long-term warehousing and postal operations would be moved off the island.  However he reassured customers that ""we don't foresee any significant changes to our customer service"".  ""Healthspan is a Guernsey based business that I started here in the island because I am a Guernseyman,"" he said."
218,"Three US soldiers were killed in action in southern Iraq on Wednesday, the military has said.  The deaths make June the deadliest month for American soldiers in the country in two years.  The US military said they died as the result of a ""hostile event"" but gave few further details.  However, one report said the three died when a rocket hit a US base near the Iranian border.  An unnamed US military official quoted by the Associated Press said that the type of weapon used bore the hallmarks of a Shia militia with strong links to Iran.  The independent icasualties count of US service member fatalities in Iraq now stands at 4,469.  US fatalities in Iraq have been rare since Washington officially ended combat operations in the country last August, leaving about 45,000 troops.  The role of the US army, which is due to pull out of Iraq on 31 December, is to advise and help the security forces.  But both US and Iraqi governments are now considering extending the deadline of troops leaving the country partly, analysts say, to counter Iran's influence.  There have been several attacks blamed on Shia militias aiming to force the military out."
219,"A Pan Am jumbo jet with 258 passengers on board has crashed on to the town of Lockerbie near the Scottish borders.  Initial reports indicate it crashed into a petrol station in the centre of the town, between Carlisle and Dumfries, and burst into a 300-foot fireball.  Hundreds are feared dead as airline officials said flight 103 was about two-thirds full with 255 adults and three children on board.  Rescue teams have confirmed there are many casualties at the scene including townspeople who were on the ground.  The Boeing 747 left London Heathrow at 1800 GMT bound for New York's JFK airport.  Shortly after 1900 the flight disappeared from radar screens at Prestwick Air Traffic Control Centre.  At 1908 there were reports by the Civil Air Traffic Control Authorities of an explosion on the ground 15 miles north of the Scottish border. Details of the accident are still unclear but there are unconfirmed reports the plane has ploughed into cars and houses. An eyewitness said the aircraft has hit a central part of the town in a residential area. ""There was just a terrible explosion, you just couldn't describe it,"" he told the BBC. ""It is just impossible to approach the town but at the time it went up there was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up. ""It was virtually raining fire - it was just liquid fire."" Parts of the town are being evacuated and a hall has been converted into a refuge centre. Dumfries and Galloway Hospital, about 20 miles away, is on emergency alert. Ambulances from southern Scotland and Cumbria have been sent to the scene. The RAF has sent personnel and helicopters from Scotland and Northern England, along with mountain rescue teams to help police. The A74 has been cordoned off after police reported several parked cars on fire. It is thought the plane would have been flying at about 31,000 ft over Lockerbie when it exploded."
220,"India is now the fastest growing aviation market in the world.  A rapidly expanding economy, incredibly cheap fares and bullish new airlines are all driving the growth.  Hundreds of new aircraft are being ordered and airports like Delhi are planning to handle up to 100 million passengers a year, more than any airport in the world does today.  On the tarmac at Delhi's International Airport you can see the change happening.  The air is filled with the roar of jet engines as new airliners land, disgorge their passengers, then head off on their next trip.  Fuel trucks and baggage trolleys trundle purposefully to and fro. A dark haze hangs in the sky turning the setting sun into a soft, red disc.  In the terminals check-in counters are swamped by passengers.  At the ticket offices people clamour for seats, trying to snap up some of the cheapest fares in the world.  According to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (Capa), passenger numbers are growing faster in India than anywhere else.  In the six months to September last year the number of people carried by airlines in India leapt 45% compared with 2005.  ""India is accelerating quickly after years of inertia. The potential is huge,"" a recent report by Capa says. ""Managed correctly, India stands poised as one of the most exciting aviation markets in the world.""  Posing on the tarmac this week, surrounded by photographers and news cameramen was one of the new airline tycoons with big ambitions.  Vijay Mallya was standing in front of an Airbus A380 superjumbo.  He has ordered five for his company Kingfisher Airlines, with an option to buy five more. Kingfisher is less than two years old, and not even making a profit yet.  ""With the five airplanes we've ordered we intend to launch daily services between Delhi and New York and Bombay and New York,"" Mr Mallya says.  ""I've publicly stated that by 2010 we aim to be India's largest airline. We're on track to achieve that.""  Just four years ago, before India liberalised aviation, there were only three main domestic airlines. Today there are around a dozen, among them aggressive budget carriers fighting for passengers.  None are making money yet, but 500 new aircraft are on order, and 2,000 new pilots will have to be hired.  The country's economic boom is what lies behind the growth. People have money to spend. And tickets on many routes start at less than $1 each.  Kapil Kaul, Capa's chief executive for India and the Middle East, believes that for the next 20 years India will be the world's fastest growing aviation market.  ""This is all a combination of the economy doing very well and people having money to spend on travel which is what is creating this unbelievable kind of euphoria about aviation in India,"" he says. ""And on the other side the fares are ridiculously low.""  Today Delhi airport sees up to 20 million passengers a year. The busiest airport in the world is Atlanta with 84 million.  But India's capital has begun a massive expansion programme, planning for 100 million passengers by 2030.  Few of those flying today, though, know what all this will mean in terms of pollution and carbon emissions.  ""I'm not thinking about all that right now,"" said Anita Gupta as she arrived to catch her flight to Mumbai.  ""How it impacts the environment is difficult to grasp,"" added Anjali, as she queued at the security gate.  Danesh, a businessman, was the only person we found who was concerned.  ""All these additional planes being added to the system, and the fuel being emitted, causing more warming is very hazardous,"" he said, ""but I am still flying because I have to for my job.""  For now, India's priority is a massive programme of building: half a dozen new international airport terminals, new runways, new infrastructure.  Worrying about the environmental cost will come later."
221,"The North East city topped a traffic noise table with 80.4 decibels, said to be the equivalent of a loud alarm clock constantly ringing in a person's ear.  Tranquil Torquay emerged as the quietest of the 41 towns and cities surveyed, at just 60 decibels.  Some relatively small towns, such as Darlington, Doncaster and Gillingham, proved to be louder than major metropolitan cities including Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham.  The report, compiled by the Ear Institute at the University College London, and Widex, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer, looked at traffic noise in the towns and cities across England during rush hour periods.  Measurements were taken in October and November in a variety of locations in each town and city, at sites where people came into close proximity with traffic.  Several readings were taken in each place over a period of 10 to 20 minutes to avoid any inconsistencies caused by, for example, one particularly loud lorry travelling through an otherwise quiet town.  The averages of all the readings were taken to find the official reading for that area.  It concluded the noise levels uncovered were a threat to health and well-being and should be seen as an issue comparable to air pollution.  Report author Professor Deepak Prasher, of the Ear Institute, said: ""Noise pollution in our towns and cities is a growing problem and can have a serious long-term impact on our health and well-being.  ""Noise not only annoys but also can raise our stress levels and associated hormone levels.  Although the difference between noisy Newcastle and tranquil Torquay was 20.4 decibels, the hearing experts said that because decibels are a logarithmic index, the results made Newcastle 100 times noisier than Torquay.  While Newcastle's noise was compared to an alarm clock in the ear, Torquay's was said to be similar to a normal conversation."
222,"Do Bigfin reef squid listen out for predatory whales?    The discovery resolves a century-long debate over whether cephalopods, the group of sea creatures that includes octopus, squid, cuttlefish and nautiluses, can hear sounds underwater. Compared to fish, octopus and squid do not appear to hear particularly well. But the fact they can hear raises the possibility that these intelligent animals may use sound to catch prey, communicate with one another or listen out for predators. The question of whether cephalopods can perceive sound has been controversial since the early 20th Century. Some experiments suggested that blind octopus seemed able to locate the sounds produced by boats or by tapping on the outside of a tank. But most cephalopods lack a gas-filled chamber, such as the swim bladders that fish can use to hear. That suggested they could not detect the pressure wave component of sound. However, sensory physiologist Hong Young Yan of the Taiwan National Academy of Science in Taipei, Taiwan suspected that octopus and squid might use another organ called the statocyst to register sound. An octopus's hearing is tuned to life on the seafloor The statocyst is a sac-like structure containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs. Fish also use it to detect sounds, and in previous research, Yan showed that prawns can use their statocysts to hear. ""So we extended our work from prawns to cephalopods,"" says Yan. Yan's team tested the auditory capabilities of two species, the Common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana, often called the Bigfin reef squid. They discovered that the octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. The squid can hear an wider range of sound from 400Hz to 1500Hz, they report in Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part A. ""That indicates that squid have a better hearing capability than the octopus,"" says Yan. ""Interestingly though, both species hear best at a frequency of 600Hz."" Yan's team had to overcome particular technical challenges to investigate the cephalopods' hearing ability. The usual way to prove that an organism can hear is to measure how its nervous system electrically responds to sound. But that can involve directly attaching electrodes to exposed nerves, an invasive procedure that could harm delicate cephalopods. So Yan invented a non-invasive method, which involves placing electrodes on an animal's body to measure the electrical activity in its brain. In this way, he could measure within just a couple of hours whether the brain of an octopus or squid responds to sound. The discovery could open up a new understanding of cephalopod behaviour. ""The key question which I would like to investigate is what kind of sounds are they listening to?"" says Yan. ""Perhaps they listen to sound to evade predators and can eavesdrop to sounds made by their prey. Or, perhaps they even could make sounds to communicate among themselves."" For example, because octopus or squid do not possess gas-filled chambers within their bodies, they cannot amplify sounds, limiting their hearing ability. But they can hear as well as invertebrates such as prawns, although less well than many species of fish and the toothed whales which often eat them. ""Squid are heavily preyed upon by toothed whales including dolphins. So perhaps their hearing would aid them to avoid the pinging sounds made by dolphins,"" says Yan. He says the different abilities of the octopus and squid also reflect the environment they live in. The common octopus dwells on the seabed, which is covered by large rocks, boulders, coral reef and other features. In water, sounds above 1000Hz have a wavelength less than 1.5m. Such sound waves cannot in turn pass objects greater than 1.5m in size, and they get deflected, which could explain why the octopus doesn't need to hear them. Squid live in the open water where there are fewer obstacles, and therefore sounds pass uninterrupted over a greater frequency range.     "
223,"The BBC Trust has ruled that Labour MP Diane Abbott should not have been paid appearance fees by political discussion show This Week for the past two years.  The fees paid to Ms Abbott, a regular guest with ex-Tory MP Michael Portillo and presenter Andrew Neil, should have stopped when she became a frontbencher.  The BBC claimed rules banning payments to MPs representing their parties did not apply as This Week was not a ""normal"" political show.  But this was rejected by the Trust.  The Trust also ruled the MP's appearances had been ""too frequent"" since she became a shadow minister.  In January Ulster Unionist peer Lord Laird complained that Ms Abbott had received five payments of £839 and one of £869 for appearances on This Week since she was promoted to the Labour front bench in 2010.  Diane Abbott and Michael Portillo were a great TV double-act on This Week, helping make politics more accessible to the viewer. But the Labour MP had to give up her regular appearances when she stood for the party leadership, and later became the shadow minister for public health. Lord Laird complained that, on at least six occasions since then, Ms Abbott had been paid more than £800 a show, rather than a lower ""disturbance fee"", in breach of BBC guidelines. At first the BBC defended the payments, saying This Week was ""not a traditional political programme"" and Ms Abbott had a co-presenter role, rather than appearing as an MP or Labour front-bencher. But after Lord Laird appealed to the BBC Trust, executives conceded ""with hindsight"" that she had been paid too much and appeared too often since becoming a shadow minister. If she appears again, she will receive ""a realistic disturbance fee"".  The BBC's editorial guidelines state that MPs should not be paid for appearances where they are ""speaking as a member of their party or expressing political views"".  The guidelines allow for the payment of a realistic ""disturbance fee"" to cover the time and inconvenience involved in appearing in a broadcast but Lord Laird argued that the payments to Ms Abbott went beyond this.  BBC director general Mark Thompson responded to the peer in February, passing on the views of This Week's producers.  They said that while the guidelines state that they should not normally pay MPs to appear, This Week was ""not a traditional political programme"".  They argued that, although Diane Abbott and Michael Portillo were asked to express political opinions, they also have a co-presenter role, interviewing other guests.  Lord Laird complained again that the producers were being allowed ""to flout the BBC's own editorial policy"" expressing surprise at their assertion that This Week was ""not a normal political programme"".  The Trust's Editorial Standards Committee ruled that payments to Ms Abbott totalling £6,712 - recorded in the MPs' Register of Financial Interests - constituted a breach of the guidelines.  Ms Abbott, who is MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, was a regular presenter of This Week until 2010, when she ran for the Labour leadership in the contest won by Ed Miliband.  During the leadership campaign she was replaced on the programme by other Labour politicians including Caroline Flint and Charles Clarke.  The new Labour leader appointed her to the front bench as shadow public health minister.  At the time she tweeted: ""No more 'This Week'. BBC management say I cannot be a shadow minister and be on the program (sic). Sad.""  Her role was filled by other well-known Labour MPs including former home secretary Alan Johnson, but the BBC Trust recorded a total of eight subsequent appearances by Ms Abbott since she joined Ed Miliband's front bench team.  A spokeswoman for BBC News said that they ""note the findings"" of the Trust."
224,"Bahraini journalists risk prosecution for offences which include ""undermining"" the government and religion. Self-censorship is widespread.  Bahrain is notorious for jailing journalists, often for extended periods, says Reporters Without Borders. Journalists are convicted on such charges as participating in protests and supporting terrorism.  The government uses the Press Law to curb criticism of Islam or the king, and supposed incitement to actions that undermine state security.  TV is the main source of news. Most domestic broadcasters are state-run. An opposition satellite station, Lualua TV, operates from London.  There were almost 1.3 million internet users by 2016 (Internetlivestats.com).  The internet is the last platform for free expression, but is subject to strong surveillance and curbs, says Freedom House.  Social media users face arrest and prosecution ""for everything from serious government criticism to satirical jokes"", and there is extensive blocking of online content.

225,"        ...Continued Tim, this is how Humph describes you. See if you agree with what he says: ""Prone to argue with the chairman, slightly vulnerable, perspires a lot, a favourite with the crowd - people hiss when I'm cruel to him,"" said Humph.    Tim: Yes, I think none of that's true except the bit about my perspiring a lot. I do do that, I have to say. Yes, I'll accept that. I'm very pleased with that. Move on..    Barry, Humph describes you thus: ""The gag man. There are no embarrassing silences thanks to you...    Barry: Embarrassing noises but not silences.  Inteviewer: ...bottomless pit of one-liners, able to come up with gags at a second's notice, provides the bricks and mortar.""  Barry: And they let me appear in it sometimes as well. I bring my wheelbarrow. It's very gracious of him though, particularly about my quick wit.  Tim: Anyway, what would he know?    Graeme, you're described thus: ""Bides his time, picks his moment, a punchline man supreme, very dry, often has the perfect punchline which helps me (Humph) end the show on a high note.    Tim: Very dry as opposed to the very sweaty me, is that what he's saying?   Barry: Was that Humph who said that?  Interviewer: Yes.  Barry: I detect a very Graeme style in that.  Graeme: I put a stop to the fun basically is what he's saying.  Tim: Yes, but you bide your time about it.    Humph's very modest about his own comic abilities. What do you think his particular gifts are?    Barry: He's very arrogant, overbearing and quite ruthless.  Tim: I've been a fan of his since I was a teenager. I used to go listen to his band which still plays magnificently today. And I still get a thrill out of working with Humph. It's extraordinary, after all these years. He's such an incredibly nice and bright man and he is modest, but he shouldn't be. I think he's quite fantastic.  Barry: I still think 'It's him, it's him!'.    How much of his stuff is written and how much is ad-libbed?    Tim: Well, he is capable of writing everything but Iain Pattinson actually writes his script now. I think Iain would say that the great thing is you're writing for a great man. There's nothing worse for a writer than to write something that is delivered badly. Iain writes some good stuff and Humph makes it even better which is perfect for a writer.  Graeme: And, obviously, the nature of the show is not all scripted. Humph reads his links then we play the games and Humph says injections of his own and very often they're show-stoppers as well. He's an extremely funny man. I don't think he knows how funny he is or how he is funny which is probably a good thing - he just does it.  Barry: He's in a great tradition like Kenneth Horne was in Round the Horne - the obeying man in the middle with all the idiots milling about and he's never quite sure what's going on but he just wants to get it over.  Tim: And the seeming innocence allows him to be absolutely filthy. ""Humph can't have said that, can he?"" And, of course, everything he says is double entendre anyway and he looks really, genuinely surprised if the audience laughs. As Graeme says, he can ad-lib as well. I remember something he said during our recording on Sunday. He said something like ""Your hand writing is so bad, I have to pin it up and run past it to read it."" I don't quite know what it means but it made me laugh enormously.         Back to Interviews...     "
226,"The Oscar-winning American actor, Walter Matthau, has died of a heart attack aged 79. He was pronounced dead on Saturday morning shortly after being brought into St John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, said a hospital spokesman.       Over a carreer that spanned more than 40 years, Matthau, who became a Hollywood legend, appeared in more than 50 films. He was a popular character actor, and went from playing villains to become the modern king of the entertainment world's grumpy but lovable slobs. He is best known for his decades-long screen partnership with Jack Lemmon. It was their first duet in a 1966 film the Fortune Cookie that earned Matthau stardom. Matthau would later say of Lemmon: ""When were working we always seemed to understand what we're thinking about.""       Lemmon, himself a famous comedian, praised the funny side of Matthau. ""The biggest problem, and the only problem, I have working with Walter, who is a great actor, is that I have a great deal of difficulty not laughing."" Matthau's most recent comedy, Hanging Up, was released only this year, starring Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. Matthau's first big Broadway performance was in 1948, but it was his 1965 appearance in Neil Simon's The Odd Couple that launched him into stardom. The film version of the show released in 1968 became a classic.          The biggest problem, and the only problem, I have working with Walter, who is a great actor, is that I have a great deal of difficulty not laughing    Matthau won the Academy Award for best supporting actor for Billy Wilder's 1966 comedy The Fortune Cookie. In May 1993 he was honoured with a Lifetime's Achievement Award by America's National Association of Theatre Owners. The actor survived several serious health setbacks during his career. While making The Fortune Cookie in 1966, he suffered a bad heart attack. His doctor attributed it to smoking three packs a day and constant worry about gambling and told him to give up both. Matthau stopped smoking.          When were working we always seemed to understand what we're thinking about    In 1976, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in freezing weather for Grumpy Old Men in 1993, he was hospitalised for double pneumonia. In December 1995, he had a colon tumor removed. It tested benign. He was also hospitalised in May 1999 for more than two months after another bout with pneumonia. When Matthau was brought into St John's Health Center hospital on Saturday morning, he was in ""full cardiac arrest"" and was pronounced dead at 0142 am PDT (0842 am GMT)."
227,"Mr Benn creator David McKee changed Festing to Festive Road in the stories    Residents of the street that helped inspire the Mr Benn stories have clubbed together to pay tribute to the classic children's character. Festing Road, in Putney, south London, became famous when illustrator David McKee lived there in the late 1960s and made it Mr Benn's home address. On Saturday, an engraved paving slab will be laid outside the house where McKee invented his famous cartoon. McKee has also revealed that he is in talks about a Mr Benn movie. Mr Benn's adventures always began when he visited a magical fancy dress shop. Everyone used to say that Mr Benn was probably stoned, and now he really is!    The shop's changing room was a portal to another world which reflected Mr Benn's chosen costume. The stories are best known through the 13 TV episodes that were first broadcast in the early 1970s, and have often been repeated. McKee, who lives in France, will be attending Saturday's celebration party. ""I'm very fond of Mr Benn,"" McKee told the BBC. ""When you create a character, it's very much like your children - you have to give them a certain amount of attention and a certain amount of liberty as well."" For his stories, McKee changed Festing Road to Festive Road, and had Mr Benn living at number 52 - next door to his own house at number 54. ""I think it was because in the first book I drew myself looking out of the window, and I thought it would be quite nice to have him next door,"" said McKee. Neighbours in Festing Road clubbed together to pay for the stone The engraved paving stone was the idea of the current resident of number 54, Hugh Thompson. Mr Thompson, 63, said he had no idea about his home's history when he moved in three years ago. ""It's all been a bit of a surprise to find I live in a national monument,"" he said. The idea for the paving stone came during a visit to Australia last year when Mr Thompson noticed a Sydney suburb had the street names on the pavements. He suggested it to the residents of Festing Road and they raised £500 to pay for the slab to be engraved. The stone will be unveiled on Saturday with residents dressing up in many of the costumes worn by Mr Benn, including the diver, cook, caveman, hunter, clown, wizard and knight. McKee, who is also the creator of King Rollo and Elmer the Elephant, is working on a new Mr Benn picture book and a Mr Benn novel for older children. ""I've got quite a lot of that written,"" he said. He also plans to create high-definition versions of the original cartoons. ""We are quite actively talking about that, I've seen a test and it gives them a very different life,"" he said. ""Television I see now is very zap bang wallop, and Mr Benn isn't like that, but I get letters from people who say how much their children are enjoying it."" McKee also revealed that Mr Benn had been optioned for a movie ""recently enough for the contract not to be dry"". He added: ""There are quite a few people interested in doing it and it is with someone at the moment - it's a project that is very much alive."" McKee said he was looking forward to Saturday's unveiling ceremony with members of his family who grew up in Festing Road. ""Everyone used to say that Mr Benn was probably stoned, and now he really is!""     "
228,"Australia has sent its first troops to the Persian Gulf for a possible war on Iraq amid furious public protest.  Demonstrators heckled Australian Prime Minister John Howard and defence chiefs as they said goodbye to 350 troops setting sail on Thursday from Sydney.  Mr Howard insisted the deployment did not mean that Australia had decided to support any war with Iraq, but rather that the pre-positioning of forces increased the ""likelihood of (the crisis) being resolved peacefully"".  But opposition parties, church and community groups, and anti-war activists condemned the move, which was made without recourse to Australia's parliament.  The troops leaving on HMAS Kanimbla will comprise an eventual Australian force of about 1,500 personnel and only 150 combat troops which will join some 180,000 US and British troops already stationed in the Gulf.  The personnel on HMAS Kanimbla were to join two other Australian ships already stationed in the Gulf policing sanctions against Iraq.  They will be followed by Australian special forces commandoes who will leave from Perth on Friday.  About 150 protesters shouted ""Go Yourself"" to Mr Howard as he waved off the HMAS Kanimbla contingent.  ""It is a monumental snubbing of the democratic processes in this country,"" said Greens party leader Bob Brown.  ""The Howard government should know that the people are not behind him,"" said Gillian Deakin, the co-ordinator of Medical Association for the Prevention of War.  ""This action is wrong and we are sending a very wrong message to our Muslim neighbours,"" she added.  Australia's response to the Bali terror attack last October, which has been widely blamed on a South East Asian Islamic militant group, has provoked tension within both its own Muslim community and its regional neighbours.  The Australian police have conducted raids on Muslim homes suspected of terrorist connections, and Mr Howard has threatened to wage pre-emptive strikes on any countries in the region suspected of harbouring terrorists."
229,"Louis XV was king of France from 1715 to 1774. He was nicknamed 'the Well-Beloved', but his failures contributed to the crisis that brought on the French Revolution.  Louis was born at Versailles on 15 February 1710. At the age of five, he succeeded his great grandfather Louis XIV as king of France. The Duke of Orleans became regent. After the duke's death, Louis was heavily influenced by his former tutor, Andre-Hercule de Fleury, whom he later created chief minister. Fleury ensured relatively stable government for the next 17 years. In 1725, Louis was married to Maria Leczczynska, daughter of the deposed king of Poland.  After Fleury's death Louis took only a sporadic interest in government. He was heavily influenced by a series of favourites, particularly his mistresses Madame de Pompadour and, after Pompadour's death in 1764, the Comtesse du Barry.  In 1733, France became involved in the War of the Polish Succession, in an attempt to restore the queen's father to the Polish throne. The attempt failed, but France gained the Duchy of Lorraine.  In 1740, in the War of the Austrian Succession, France allied with Prussia against Britain and Austria. The French won a series of military victories and occupied the Austrian Netherlands. However, Louis subsequently returned the territory to Austria, for which he was lauded abroad but heavily criticised in France.  In the Seven Years War (1756-1763) alliances were reversed, and the French fought with their long-standing enemy Austria against Britain and Prussia. The French defeat resulted in the loss of most her colonies to Britain, marking a low point in French prestige.  In the 1760s, a new minister, the Duc de Choiseul, managed to restore some stability to France. But the extravagances of Louis's court, the huge expense of decades of warfare and the defeat of attempts at reform left monarchy and government weakened by the end of Louis's reign. He died at Versailles on 10 May 1774 and was succeeded by his grandson who became Louis XVI."
230,"Sweden has decided not to ban sexist advertising, saying it would risk undermining the country's cherished right to freedom of speech. In Norway, ads can use sexual images but they must be relevant But the decision puts the country at odds with its Nordic neighbours. Norway and Denmark have strict limits on the use of such images for commercial gain. In Norway, sexist advertising has been banned since 2003. The ban forms part of a much broader package of legal limits on advertising, protecting the depiction of religion, sexuality, race and gender. ""Basically, if something is offensive or it makes the viewer feel uncomfortable when they look at it, it shouldn't be done"", explained Sol Olving, head of Norway's Kreativt Forum, an association of the country's top advertising agencies. ""Naked people are wonderful, of course, but they have to be relevant to the product. You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream, but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car."" Norwegian firms that refuse to remove or alter offensive adverts after having a complaint upheld face a hefty fine of 500,000 Norwegian kroner (£49,000; 62,500 euros). But Ms Olving says there were no complaints about the law from advertisers, who have learnt to come up with less obvious ways of persuading consumers to part with their cash. We're not that puritan that you can't have naked bodies - but it has to be done in the right way, with charm and passion    But in Denmark, where similar guidelines have been in place since 1993, some firms are ready to exploit the additional free publicity they will get from being highlighted. Denmark's advertising ombudsman recounts a recent example of a male underwear company which was forced to withdraw adverts portraying women in low-paid jobs, after outrage from several trade unions. One ad in the series showed a nurse lying on a bed with the male underpants covering her face, implying that she had just had sex with a patient. ""People in these different occupations already have problems with sexual discrimination,"" says ombudsman Henrik Oe. ""You cannot play on the male fantasy that a patient can have sex with a nurse just to sell a product."" ""These areas of employment are already ones where women are already vulnerable to sexual harassment,"" he added. Both Norway and Denmark are keen to emphasise that their advertising limits do not prevent freedom of speech, stifle creativity or mean that there is never a beautiful naked human form on display. In Denmark, Mr Oe says, many advertisers are becoming increasingly creative, using humour to stretch the boundaries and appeal to Danish consumers. He says he receives only around 10 complaints about sexist advertising each year and that firms normally remove the offending images quickly. From Oslo, Ms Olving says: ""We're not that puritan that you can't have naked bodies. But it has to be done in the right way, with charm and passion."" Sweden says freedom of expression is a fundamental right Sweden, however, despite commissioning a special government rapporteur to look into the matter, is not following the legal professor's advice that freedom of speech does not extend to commercial messages and limits are needed. ""This law would be against freedom of speech, which is protected by the constitution,"" said Malin Engstedt, spokesperson for Equality Minister Nyamko Sabuni. ""The minister is not convinced that this law would improve things,"" she added. Ms Engstedt said the Swedish government was confident that efforts made by the country's advertisers themselves - including the introduction of an ombudsman similar to Denmark's to oversee adverts - would be more effective. ""They are more than capable of finding other ways of advertising their products,"" she said."
231,"American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the US military headquarters, killing 184 people, after it was hijacked as part of an al-Qaeda plot.  The release of the video, taken from a Pentagon security camera, comes after a Freedom of Information Act request by legal watchdog Judicial Watch.  The group said it hoped to dispel conspiracy theories about the crash.  ""Finally, we hope that this video will put to rest the conspiracy theories involving American Airlines Flight 77,"" president Tom Fitton said.  Some theorists have suggested the aircraft was shot down in flight, and that the Pentagon was struck by a missile.  Stills released in 2002 showed the moment the hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon, killing 125 people in the building and 59 passengers and crew.  The crash came shortly after two other hijacked airlines were flown into the twin towers at the World Trade Center in New York.  Judicial Watch filed the freedom of information request in 2004, but the Pentagon refused to release the video because it was part of the investigation involving al-Qaeda plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, the group said.  This February the group sued the government over its refusal, saying there was ""no legal basis"" for it.  Washington agreed to release the video after a court sentenced Moussaoui to life in jail for his role in 9/11 earlier this month, a Judicial Watch spokeswoman told the BBC.  The group said it fought to obtain the video because ""it was very important to complete the public record"" on the attacks.  French author Thierry Meyssan alleged that Flight 77 did not crash into the Pentagon and suggested a truck bomb or missile caused the damage.  Such views are challenged by witness testimony at the scene of an aircraft fitting the description of Flight 77 crashing into the site.  Correspondents say the release of the video is not unhelpful to the Bush administration.  The footage serves as a graphic reminder of why the US launched its global ""war on terror"" and is still fighting it, the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says."
232,"England striker Wayne Rooney's ban for the Euro 2012 Championship has been reduced to two matches from three after an appeal to Uefa in Switzerland.  He was punished after being sent off for kicking Miodrag Dzudovic during a 2-2 draw with Montenegro in October.  Rooney, 26, will now be available for England's third Group D game, against joint hosts Ukraine, but will miss the fixtures against France and Sweden.  The third match of his ban has been suspended for four years.  A Uefa spokesman told BBC Sport the third game ban would kick in only if he is sent off for violent conduct in another European Championship match.  ""The ban applies only to national team competition governed by Uefa,"" said the spokesman.  Rooney has also agreed to do one day of community service with a Uefa project.  England manager Fabio Capello joined Rooney for the 90-minute hearing before a three-man appeals panel on Thursday morning.  The Manchester United forward travelled to Nyon for the appeal after his club's shock Champions League exit at FC Basel on Wednesday.  Adrian Bevington, the Football Association director of communications and Club England managing director, said: ""We've had a very fair hearing.  ""Wayne and Fabio are both very pleased. Wayne will head back to Manchester as a matter of priority.  ""Wayne has always made clear that he accepted it was a red card offence.  ""We arrived with the possibility of him missing the entire group phase - it would have been a huge challenge for Fabio and the team, so to have him available for the final group march against Ukraine is clearly very positive.""  It is believed the FA argued a three-match ban that affects games in the finals of a major tournament is a harsher sanction than a suspension of a similar length which would just affect qualifying games.  The appeal included a written letter by Dzudovic asking that the ban be reduced and the FA sent a team including Adam Lewis QC, who has previous experience of chairing Rugby Football Union appeal hearings, a Swiss sports lawyer, its own solicitor James Bonnington and a representative from external lawyers Charles Russell.  Rooney had previously admitted the kick was ""stupid"" but maintained that the ban was ""a bit harsh"".  The striker, who has scored 28 goals in 73 appearances for England, was not included in the 1-0 friendly wins over Spain and Sweden in November.  But Capello has said his most prolific forward will appear in subsequent friendlies in the new year, with one organised against the Netherlands at Wembley on 29 February.  BBC pundit Mark Lawrenson said he expected Capello to select Rooney for Euro 2012.  ""England will now obviously take Wayne Rooney but I always thought they would - that question was like asking Argentina would they take Lionel Messi to the World Cup in similar circumstances. Of course they would,"" he said.  ""Rooney's presence will be a lift to Fabio Capello and the other players. If they go into that game against Ukraine needing a win or a draw to go through they can call on him - and the fact that he is there might just inspire some big performances in the first two games from players who don't want to get left out of the third one.  ""It's really good news for England and Capello and I think the right level of punishment has been reached in the end.  ""I always wonder when Uefa give a three-game ban whether they are actually leaving leeway for an appeal and then room for them to reduce it.""  Manchester United will play in the Europa League after being knocked out of the Champions League, but a Uefa spokesman said the suspended third game of his ban could not be invoked by a dismissal for his club.  If Rooney was sent off for violent conduct at Euro 2012, he would miss the following two matches - one automatic game for a dismissal, plus another invoked under the current suspension.  So for example, he would be out of the semi-final and final should he be dismissed for violent conduct in any quarter-final game."
233,"The Scout Association in the UK has announced an alternative version of its membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.  From January, instead of vowing ""to do my duty to God"", scouts will be able to promise to ""uphold our scout values"".  The new promise will exist alongside the core scout promise, which has remained unchanged for 106 years.  The Church of England, the Church of Scotland and other faiths have welcomed the move.  ""I am confident that our relationship with the scouting movement will continue to flourish,"" said the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who leads the Church's work with young people.  ""In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs, scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life.""  The Right Reverend Lorna Hood, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, also welcomed the move.  ""I am extremely happy that the Scout Movement has taken this very sensible and inclusive step while ensuring that faith and belief remain a vital element of their ethos,"" she said.  This is the first time the scout movement has introduced a promise for new members who are atheists - although alternatives to the core promise have existed for nearly 50 years for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.  Hindus and Buddhists are currently permitted to refer to ""my Dharma"" in the scout promise, while Muslims can refer to Allah.  Wayne Bulpitt, the association's UK chief commissioner, said the move signified its ""determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society"".  Mr Bulpitt added the additional alternative promise would not alter the association's commitment to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme.  He said he was delighted the move had been achieved with the support of key faith groups as well as the British Humanist Association (BHA).  Andrew Copson, the BHA's chief executive, said the move could only strengthen scouting: ""Scouting is an enormously significant youth organisation and in some parts of the country offers the only activities young people have.  ""Their initiative sends out a strong signal that the vast majority of young people who do not see themselves as belonging to any religion have values that are worthy of respect and should be explicitly welcomed and catered for in any activity that seeks to be genuinely inclusive.""  The association's total UK membership has increased from 444,936 in 2005 to 536,787 this year and includes 77,472 girls  Last month the Guides dropped reference to God from their joining promise, following a consultation that found the movement needed to do more to include the non-religious and those of other faiths.  A ban on atheist scout leaders will also be lifted.  The Scout Association confirmed to the BBC that it would rewrite its equal opportunities policy which currently states: ""The avowed absence of religious belief is a bar to appointment to a leadership position."""
234,"Mr Thaksin lodged an £81.6m takeover bid for City in June through his company UK Sports Investments and has steadily built up his shareholding.  His spokesman said that he now owned 74.03%, close to the 75% needed to take the club off the stock market, but that the deal was unconditional.  Sven-Goran Eriksson was named manager of the Premier League club on Friday.  Former England coach Mr Eriksson has signed a three-year contract and succeeds Stuart Pearce.  The Eastlands board has backed the bid but there have been concerns about the source of the money, with Mr Thaksin facing corruption charges in Thailand.  But the man who brokered the City deal has said ""the money is clean"".  On Sunday, Keith Harris, executive chairman of Seymour Pierce Investment Bank, said the money had been ""legitimately and transparently transferred to the UK"".  Mr Thaksin will have to pass the Premier League's standard ""fit and proper person"" test before being able to complete the proposed takeover.  They have also frozen his assets but Mr Thaksin insisted this would have no effect on his takeover of the club and that the charges were politically motivated by the military installed government that replaced him.  Leading shareholders including current board members, former chairman Francis Lee and BSkyB have all agreed to sell their shares to Mr Thaksin."

King Abdullah is the first Saudi king to visit India in 51 years and will be the guest of honour at Republic Day celebrations on Thursday.  His visit is seen as very significant with both countries keen to build ties.  India's growing economy is fuelling greater energy needs and Saudi Arabia supplies a quarter of its oil.  ""I consider myself to be in my second homeland,"" King Abdullah said soon after his arrival.  ""The relationship between India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an historic one, we have been old friends and, God willing, this visit will renew these historic ties.""  The king arrived in the Indian capital, Delhi, late on Tuesday and was personally received at the airport by the Indian prime minister, a rare honour.  For nearly half a century, India and Saudi Arabia were on opposite sides of the Cold War divide.  Delhi saw the kingdom as close to long-time rival Pakistan and was also suspicious of its support for radical Islamic groups.  Saudi Arabia never approved of India's relationship with Moscow or its failure to condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  Ahead of the visit, Saudi Arabia granted clemency to an Indian man who was to have lost an eye as punishment for attacking a Saudi man in 2003.  Puthan Vettil Abdul Latif Naushad was convicted of damaging the eye of a Saudi man during a scuffle.  The case received wide attention in the Indian media and the Indian government took up the case with the Saudi government.  The Saudi king has also offered to pay for the repair of one of the country's leading mosques, the Jama Masjid (Grand Mosque) in Delhi.  The 17th century mosque, built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan who also built the Taj Mahal, is in urgent need of repair.  Indian media reports also said that the king wants to fund education in India.  Both offers are said to have raised concerns with Indian security agencies who are said to fear that the money could be used to preach radical Islam, the Times of India reported."
238,"Land's End in Cornwall has been sold for nearly £7m to the property tycoon, Peter de Savary.  Mr de Savary has said he is planning a major expansion of tourist facilities at the famous landmark.  The 105-acre site was previously owned by the Welsh property millionaire, David Goldstone, who outbid the National Trust for the granite crag.  He spent £1m on redevelopment of Britain's western-most point but ran into local opposition after he imposed an admission charge in 1983.  Two years later an inquest jury called for better safety provisions on the site after four schoolboys were washed off rocks by giant waves and drowned.  Mr de Savary said the site offered ""an outstanding opportunity to generate substantial profit from tourism"" but said his plans would put to rest the fears of local people.  ""Things will be done with sensitivity. There will be no steamrollering,"" he said.  He would not be charging an admission fee to Land's End, Mr de Savary added.  The businessman is to spend £2m redeveloping the site.  Among the plans are a hotel and a tourist facility with an ""audio visual experience"", telling visitors of the history of Land's End.  The acquisition of Land's End is the latest in a string of purchases by Mr de Savary in Cornwall.  He also owns Falmouth Docks and other waterfront land where he hopes to build a container port.  Mr de Savary also wants to use the Falmouth Docks as a base for the construction of a yacht which he hopes could win the America's Cup.  The keen yachtsman financed Britain's last challenge for the sport's most prestigious trophy in 1983.  Away from Cornwall, Mr de Savary owns Littlecote Park, a stately home in Wiltshire which won the British Tourist Authority's award for best commercial tourist attraction earlier this year."
239,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A bomb attack in the western Afghan city of Herat has killed at least 12 people and injured at least 20, police officials say. They said the attack had targeted a police convoy, killing and wounding both police and civilians. Insurgent attacks on security forces have increased in the run-up to the presidential election on 20 August. However, attacks have been mainly in the south and east, where Taliban rebels have their strongest presence. Police spokesman Raouf Ahmedi said the explosion on Monday in Herat was detonated by remote control, AP reported. Another police official, Esmatullah Alizai, told journalists that the bomb had been left in a roadside rubbish bin. ""It exploded as the convoy of district police passed by,"" he said. He was also quoted as saying that two police officials, a woman and child were among those killed, and that the district police chief had been seriously injured. The BBC's David Loyn, in the Afghan capital, Kabul, says the target may have been the governor of a district of Herat province, thought to have been travelling in the convoy. A reporter for the AFP news agency saw several police vehicles and private taxis damaged by the blast. Motorcycles and bicycles were strewn over the site, while children's shoes and a woman's veil had been abandoned there, he said. Our correspondent notes that Herat has been relatively peaceful in recent weeks as insurgents have stepped up attacks elsewhere in Afghanistan. Herat is enormously important to Afghanistan as the gateway to Iran and the town where most of the legitimate customs revenue for the Afghan government comes from, he adds. The bombing comes after the Taliban explicitly threatened to disrupt the upcoming election. A series of attacks on foreign forces at the weekend killed nine soldiers, continuing an increase seen in July, which was the deadliest month for foreign soldiers since they arrived in the country in 2001.

240,"Hundreds of thousands more visitors have come to Bethlehem As a flock of tourists strode up to the entrance of the Church of the Nativity - the reputed site of Jesus Christ's birth - a Palestinian tour guide moved in for the hard sell. ""Do you need a guide?"" asked Adil Dweib as the visitors marched by him without saying a word. In previous years, Mr Dweib would have pursued the group, but this time he shrugged his shoulders and rejoined a couple of colleagues leaning against a wall. The work of church leaders across the world has helped in selling Bethlehem as a safe city for pilgrimage    ""This year is like 2000,"" says Mr Dweib - a slight exaggeration perhaps, as the millennium year was a bumper time for tourism in Bethlehem. ""Business is good and next year there will be hopefully even more tourists,"" he adds. Community and business leaders, shopkeepers and tour guides, all tell you the same thing: the economy is getting better in this Christian pilgrimage centre in the rolling West Bank hills. During the second Palestinian uprising, which started in September 2000, tourism collapsed. Israeli military incursions were a regular occurrence and in 2002 there was the siege of the Church of the Nativity in which 39 Palestinian gunmen holed up in the church for more than five weeks. Worshippers in the Church of the Nativity - in 2002 the scene of violent siege Most visitors stayed away during this period and some of the shops still bear scars - their signage pocked by bullet holes. But with relative stability of the last two years, tourists and pilgrims are returning to the town - located 6 miles (10 km) from Jerusalem - in large numbers. According to the Bethlehem municipality, 625,000 visitors came to the town this year with a further 70,000 expected during the Christmas period. This is four times as many tourists as visited during December 2005. ""The work of church leaders across the world, along with travel agents and the Palestinian tourism ministry, has all helped in selling Bethlehem as a safe city for pilgrimage,"" says the city's Mayor Victor Batarseh. Boosting the economy in Bethlehem - where tourism is the biggest employer - has also been singled out by the international community as a key part of resuscitating the West Bank's devastated economy. Last week, international Middle East envoy Tony Blair spent a night in one of the town's hotels in a show of support. Tourism accounts for almost a fifth of the Palestinian economy, according to the city's chamber of commerce. There are about 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops in Bethlehem all employing large numbers of locals. I feel safer here than I do walking down some streets in the UK. The fact that people are coming here shows the Palestinians that they are not completely forgotten by the outside world    Victor Tabbash, owner of the Nativity Store, which sells olive wood nativity scenes, crosses, and other religious souvenirs, says that the surge in tourism means greater economic stability for the town's 25,000 residents. In addition to his shop, he runs a workshop that employees 100 workers. ""We'd like more American tourists to visit Bethlehem,"" he says. ""They spend a lot of money."" But some shopkeepers and hoteliers complain that not enough tourists spend the night in Bethlehem and that the tourists are strictly marshalled by their guides which only benefits stores paying kickbacks. Palestinians need permission to cross the Bethlehem checkpoint They also bitterly complain about Israel's West Bank barrier - here an imposing eight-metre (24-foot) concrete wall separating Bethlehem from Jerusalem. The Israeli authorities say they built the barrier as a response to Palestinian militants, including suicide bombers, attacking Israeli civilians. Residents here say it deters tourists and impedes their lives as Palestinians must get a permit to go to Jerusalem. ""Tourists think that they are entering a lion's den when they see the wall,"" says Nadia Hazboun, who works as a sales assistant in one of the Manger Square tourist shops. But most visitors' safety fears are allayed as they walk through the city's winding, windswept streets, decorated with coloured lights after a $50,000 (£25,000) donation from the Palestinian Authority. ""I feel safer here than I do walking down some streets in the UK,"" says Mike Quincy, 61, a retired police officer from Britain, visiting the city with a group of friends. ""The Palestinians feel hopeless and abandoned and the fact that people are coming here shows them that they are not completely forgotten by the outside world,"" he adds.     "

UK combat operations ended as 20th Armoured Brigade took part in a flag-lowering ceremony with a US brigade. Gordon Brown said the operation in Iraq had been a ""success story"" because of UK troops' efforts. But the Stop the War Coalition said it had been a disaster and the 179 British military deaths were made more acute by the pointlessness of the UK presence. Mr Brown, who held talks with Iraqi prime minister Nouri Maliki in Downing Street, said: ""Today Iraq is a success story. ""We owe much of that to the efforts of British troops. Our mission has not always been an easy one, many have said that we would fail. I think when the history is written of this campaign, they will say of the British military: 'We did a superb job'    ""Britain can be proud of our legacy that we leave there."" Mr Maliki said: ""There are people in Iraq who want the government to fail but our army and armed forces are ready to face these challenges."" Although Britain may be pulling its troops out of Iraq a month ahead of schedule, the row over why they were sent there in the first place in support of a US-led invasion looks set to continue. Opposition leader David Cameron called for an immediate full inquiry into the Iraq war, similar to the one carried out by the Franks Committee into the Falklands conflict. He said: ""After years of foot-dragging, I believe it is the time for the government to announce a proper Franks-style inquiry. ""Instead of starting in many months' time, it should start right now. ""There are vital lessons to learn and we need to learn them rapidly and the only justification for delay can, I'm afraid, be a political one."" In Basra itself, Defence Secretary John Hutton attended a memorial service for the military personnel killed in the conflict. The focus was a memorial wall featuring the names of the 234 UK and foreign troops and civilians who lost their lives under British command in Iraq. The names of those who died, including Italian, Dutch, Danish, American and Romanian troops, were read out before the Last Post was sounded and prayers said. Then there was a loud roar in the sky as a Tornado aircraft flew over in tribute. Those attending the service were adamant the British presence in Basra had been a force for good. Lt Col Edward Chamberlain, commanding officer of Iraq-based battalion 5 Rifles, said: ""We've been slowly working, as part of a coalition together over the six years, to achieve an end-state which is an Iraq which is secure, happy, at peace with itself and its neighbours. ""We're slowly but surely transitioning towards that."" Mr Hutton said British troops had fought ""a long and hard campaign"". He added: ""There's been no question about that, and we've paid a very high price. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""But I think when the history is written of this campaign, they will say of the British military: 'We did a superb job'."" British forces began their official pull-out last month when the UK's commander in the south of the country, Maj Gen Andy Salmon, handed over to a US general. The civilian death toll in Basra as a result of the conflict is estimated at between 3,302 and 3,766, according to data from the Iraq Body Count. Asked about the UK presence in Iraq, the country's president, Jalal Talabani, told BBC News that the mission had been one of liberation. ""In the past the British forces came to occupy against the will of the Iraqi people,"" he said. ""This time they came here to liberate Iraqi people from the worst kind of dictatorship."" But the UK Stop the War Coalition said: ""The British soldiers will leave Basra in a much worse condition than they found it, its population depleted and demoralised, its infrastructure devastated."" BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt says there is a sense of relief for many British servicemen and women that their final tour of Iraq is ending. Some were serving on their fourth tour, taking them away from home for two years out of the last six. But the BBC's John Simpson says many ordinary Iraqis in Basra are worried that the Americans who will replace them will be much more aggressive.     "
242,"Germany's western Saarland region says it wants its next generation to be bilingual in German and French.  It is part of a strategy to deepen economic ties with France, which borders the region.  Proposals by the regional government include bilingual teaching from pre-school age and requiring new state employees to be able to work in French.  Government jobs would be open to French citizens too under the proposals which are being put out to consultation.  English, currently the most taught second language, will remain important but French would become the main foreign tongue in usage in Saarland.  By 2043, Saarland should become a multilingual region with the stress on French and German ties, according to the regional government.  The Christian Democrat-led administration wants Saarland - one of the smallest German states with a population of just over one million people - to become ""an indispensible and unavoidable bridge to Germany and a gateway to France"".  The region's ""France strategy"" is designed to attract business to Saarland, which relied on its former mining industry for much of its wealth."
243,"Under international law, Israel is committed to supplying drinking water to the Palestinians and not denying them.  But Israel itself is a very arid area surrounded by desert. It rains only a few months a year - and for the past few years the region has been in the grip of drought.  ""We have a chronic water shortage, and it is getting worse year to year,"" Jacob Kaidar, the director of multilateral peace talks coordination and water issues in the Israeli foreign ministry, told BBC World Service's Politics Of Water programme.  ""Basically we have a drought almost every year, we have to cut our water supplies almost every year.""  The water that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan river system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources.  The supply is shared between Israelis and Palestinians, but, as ever, is a source of great controversy.  At the Third World Water Conference in Kyoto, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev outlined the history of water conflict around the world.  He said there had been 21 armed disputes over water in recent history - and 18 of them involved Israel.  ""It's highly unfair,"" said Yehezkel Lein, a water expert for Israeli human rights group B'tselem, who help to solve water problems in Palestinian areas.  ""We are talking about mainly the mountain aquifer and the Jordan River system. Regarding the first one Israel exploits approximately 80% of the renewal water resources, and the Palestinians the remaining 20%.  ""Regarding the Jordan River system, the Palestinians do not have any access.""  ""There is a clear linkage between the gap in water availability, and the occupation,"" he said.  ""Israel has taken advantage of its control of the West Bank in order to appropriate more water sources and to prevent Palestinians from developing new water sources that are under the land.""  Israel has controlled water supplies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since it first occupied the areas in 1967.  The 1993 Oslo Peace Accord stated that the Palestinians should have more water resources and greater control, although the Israelis disagree, insisting they supply 40 million cubic metres of water.  Many Palestinians struggle, however, as they remain unconnected to any water infrastructure.  One such place is Beit Furik, a village in the West Bank near the Palestinian town of Nablus.  ""The real problem is at the beginning of their hot summer - they will have used up their water and they will begin to suffer,"" explained Beit Furik's Mayor, Atef Atif Hanani.  ""We have about 12 tanks to collect water from Nablus, but during the Intifada the Israeli authorities have imposed checkpoints on the roads.  ""These checkpoints started to forbid these tanks from reaching Nablus, so sometimes they have to wait for about five or six hours - and some days they were forbidden.""  He added that even when the tanks were allowed through, sometimes Israeli soldiers would undo the valves and let the water back out.  Israel's Water Minister Mr Kaidar said he was ""not happy"" about a lack of co-operation, acknowledging that turning water trucks away was ""totally unacceptable.""  ""Israel is committed to supplying drinking water to the Palestinians, and not to deny them,"" he added.  But Jacob Dallal of the Israel army said that delays were unfortunate, but necessary to stop the militants.  ""We have to be very careful, but at no time lose sight of the importance of getting essential materials to people.  ""We do have to check because in the past, as has been the case with ambulances, people have taken advantage of vehicles that are supposed to be only for humanitarian purposes.""  Some statistics suggest that, in large part because of these constant arguments at checkpoints, the Palestinians use on average four times less water than the Israelis.  The mother of one family in Beit Furik, Fuaz Hanani, told Politics Of Water that they were only able to wash every two weeks, such was the shortage of water.  ""I feel angry that Israeli settlers in Itmar drink clean water while my dear family drink water from a well which sometimes has dirty or polluted water,"" Mrs Hanani said.  However, Jacob Kaidar insisted that, while he hoped co-operation between the two sides would be better in the future, Mrs Hanani should direct her anger towards her own people.  He said Palestinians were stealing water from Israeli pipes and drilling illegal wells.  ""In Gaza we have some 2,000 illegal wells, in the West Bank the report is 250 or more,"" he said.  According to Oxfam, an additional problem is that what little infrastructure the Palestinians do have is targeted by the Israelis.  ""We are helping very poor families to build new tanks on their roofs... unfortunately it's a really good target for Israeli soldiers to shoot at,"" Oxfam's Ton Berg stated.  ""We've just finished a really big water tank that would serve half a village in El Boursh and now the Israeli defence forces have announced that they will destroy it, because they need land that is officially Palestinian to build a wall.  ""So that whole village this summer will again be without clean drinking water.""  With the publication of the roadmap to peace, there had been hopes that political leaders would begin to look more closely at the water crisis in the region.  But with the roadmap apparently in crisis, it seems the Palestinians may be thirsty for a good while longer."
244,"Princess Diana's former lover James Hewitt has spoken out to end persistent rumours that he is Prince Harry's father.  The former cavalry officer said people compared Harry's looks with his own, but he stated categorically: ""There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father.  ""I can absolutely assure you that I am not.""  Prince Harry was ""already walking"" by the time his relationship with Diana began, he told The Sunday Mirror.  Mr Hewitt was Diana Princess of Wales's secret lover for five years.  Speaking in the paper, he said: ""Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine and people say we look alike.  ""I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time I must state once and for all that I'm not Harry's father.  ""When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.""  Referring to portraits by fashion photographer Mario Testino, taken to mark the Prince's 18th birthday a week ago, Hewitt said: ""Looking at the pictures I have to say he's a much more handsome chap than I ever was.""  He said he was aware the issue of Harry's paternity had been a major talking point.  However, he said he did not meet the Princess, who died in 1997, until two years after Harry was born.  In a book by Diana's former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, the rumours are also quashed.  Mr Wharfe said the gossip used to upset the Princess.  He said in his book: ""The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly.  ""The nonsense should be scotched here and now.  ""Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait."""
245,"Sixty-four percent of those who voted rejected the proposed ban, which was backed by the government, the Catholic Church and the United Nations.  The gun ownership lobby successfully argued that guns were needed for personal security.  Guns kill one person in Brazil every 15 minutes, giving it the world's highest death toll from firearms.  Last year, there were 36,000 shooting deaths. The UN says guns are the biggest cause of death among young people in Brazil.  The immediate consequence of the referendum is that gun shops will remain open.  The BBC's Steve Kingstone in Sao Paulo says that the result may surprise outsiders, given the horrific scale of gun violence in Brazil.  The defeated ""Yes"" campaign had enjoyed an early lead in the opinion polls, but it was quickly outmanoeuvred.  The ""No"" campaign convinced voters that the proposed ban would have no effect on criminals, on the grounds that criminals do not buy guns legally in shops.  Beni Barbosa, the ""No"" campaign spokesman, said: ""We managed to get our message across that Brazilians have individual rights which the state cannot take away.""  ""Here, people were not choosing whether to have a gun or not. They were voting for their rights to choose.""  Anti-gun campaigners said the swing away from a ""Yes"" vote was the result of people's desire to protest against the government's security policy.  ""We didn't lose because Brazilians like guns. We lost because people don't have confidence in the government or the police,"" said Denis Mizne, of anti-violence group Sou da Paz.  ""The 'No' campaign was much more effective. They are talking about a right to have a gun - it is a totally American debate.""  Anti-gun campaigners also accused gun makers and lobby groups such as the US National Rifle Association (NRA) of manipulating people's fears.  The referendum has been watched closely by other countries where gun-ownership is under debate.  In Washington, an NRA spokesman called the result ""a victory for freedom"".  The referendum rounded off a series of campaigns run by the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to cut down on gun crime.  Penalties for unlawfully carrying a gun have been increased, and money has been offered to people who surrender their weapons in amnesties.  The proposal to ban firearms initially had strong public support.  But opinion polls in recent days showed this backing had weakened dramatically as campaigns against the ban got off the ground.  Some opposition to the ban also came from shanty towns, or favelas, the scene of vicious turf wars between drug gangs.  Maria, a shantytown resident whose sister was gunned down by an ex-boyfriend, said disarmament would make little difference.  ""If I had the money, I would have a weapon to try to protect myself and my family,"" she told the BBC. ""The police are never going to arrive in time and if they do, they may kill you.""  There are estimated to be more than 17 million guns in Brazil, nine million of which are not registered, according to a survey by non-governmental groups."
246,"Some Marks and Spencer customers have told the BBC of cases where the chain's contactless payment terminals have taken money from cards other than the ones intended for payment.  Card are supposed to be within about 4cm of the front of the contactless terminal to work.  But some customers say payments have been taken from cards while in purses and wallets at much greater distances.  M&S said its systems had been extensively tested and were robust.  Marks and Spencer recently rolled out the contactless payments system to 644 UK stores.  The system uses something called Near Field Communication to identify a card and take payment.  Rosemary, from Sussex, got a shock when she tried to pay by chip-and-pin at her local store.  She believes her contactless Smile card was much more than 4cm away from the terminal when she visited Marks and Spencer in Chichester in April and tried to pay with her regular Lloyds debit card.  She told BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme: "" I put my card into the reader and the assistant was asking whether or not I wanted cash back.  ""Before I could answer, the transaction came up as complete and the till issued a receipt so I hadn't put in a Pin at all at that stage. I queried it with an assistant and she looked rather puzzled and looked at the receipt and compared it to my card and realised that the numbers didn't tally.""  Rosemary recognised that the four digits on the till receipt belonged to a Smile card she had in her purse, which she was holding in her other hand.  She had not realised until then that this card was able to make contactless payments.  Even when she realised it could, she thought her purse was about a foot away from the terminal when the payment was taken.  Rosemary explained what had happened to a Marks and Spencer manager, who asked her to try to repeat the transaction so he could see it himself.  Again, the Smile contactless card was debited instead of the Lloyds card she had intended to make the payment from.  M&S refunded the two transactions and a third attempt to use the Lloyds card to pay was successful.  Paula, from London, ended up paying for the same items twice.  Like Rosemary, she put her NatWest card into the chip-and-pin terminal but had her HSBC contactless card she was holding in her purse in her other hand debited instead, before she could enter her PIN.  She did not realise that she had a contactless card, and so then paid for the same items by entering the PIN for her regular debit card.  It was only a month later when she looked at her bank statement that she realised that her HSBC card was contactless, and that she had paid twice.  She returned to Marks and Spencer with her statement and it refunded her the payment on her NatWest card.  It's not just Marks and Spencer customers who have experienced this sort of problem.  A Pret a Manger customer also contacted Money Box to report a payment was taken from her contactless-enabled MBNA visa credit card in the outlet when she intended to pay with a different card.  She says the MBNA card was in her purse around 30-40 cm from the contactless card reader.  And again, she had not realised that card had a contactless facility.  Martin Emms is a researcher into new payment formats at Newcastle University's Centre for Cybercrime and Computer Security.  He also found his contactless card was debited when he placed it a few centimetres to the side of the reader from inside his wallet when he intended to pay with a normal debit card.  ""If you're placing your card to the side of the reader your intention isn't to pay,"" he said. ""The terminal is working within the specification of Near Field Communication but not within the intent.""  Money Box first raised this as an issue with Marks and Spencer back in February. It told the programme the maximum distance its terminal can read a contactless card is 4cm directly above the terminal and the field does not extend beyond the edge of the terminal area. And it said its contactless payment cannot be made if there is another card placed in the reader.  Marks and Spencer said it would like to hear from any customer who had experienced an involuntary payment.  ""We are surprised to hear the comments from your listeners, we've had almost entirely positive feedback and take-up has been very strong. We have tested our systems extensively both in labs and in stores and are confident they are robust and fit for purpose.  ""A contactless card can be read through material, e.g. a wallet, but the wallet would have to be presented to the terminal. ""  The technology used by M&S is provided by Visa Europe.  It said that the customer reports were ""extremely unusual"", and it was working with M&S and the acquiring bank to investigate the concerns.  Pret a Manger said it had not heard before of customers experiencing this, but it was investigating and it would like to hear from any other customers who have had this happen to them.  Money Box spoke to the banks whose contactless cards had been debited in error.  They said they explained what contactless cards were in accompanying literature when they sent them out.  And they said the effective range of the card was 5cm.  Richard Koch, head of policy at banking industry body UK Cards, admitted that the banks and retailers may have to look at ways of improving the contactless system.  ""We're very much in the initial stages of the roll out of contactless. We're monitoring very closely the issues that are presented,"" he said.  Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.  You can listen again via the BBC iPlayer or by downloading Money Box podcast."
247,"By Karen Coleman in Dublin Attempts are being made all over the Irish Republic to revive the Gaelic language. Confounding critics who thought it was dying out, Ireland's official language is enjoying something of a comeback. As the European Union expands and the mainstream languages of English and French become ever more dominant, many Irish people have become increasingly concerned that Gaelic would soon be a thing of the past. But Gaelic speakers are fighting back with attempts to promote their native tongue. Conas atà tú?    How are you? Cad is ainm duit? What is your name? Go raibh maigh agat Thank you One initiative uses a telephone answering service that mixes Gaelic with English words. The idea came from Brionn O'Gamhain, a development officer with Irish language organisation Muintir Chronain. ""It's our identity,"" he says. ""The Irish language is one of the oldest in the world. You can trace it back a couple of thousand years. The English language is very new in comparison, and it's something we should be proud of."" Although English is spoken daily by most people in Ireland, under the constitution Gaelic is the country's national language. But it has had a chequered history and, at stages, has nearly died out. Its decline began in the 17th and 18th centuries when Ireland's relationship with England worsened. Penal laws were introduced which saw traditional Irish systems replaced by English ones. As a result, English became the language that people needed to speak in order to succeed. According to Daithi O'Duffy of Gael Linn, an organisation which promotes the Irish language, Gaelic became associated with poverty and ignorance. ""The language of progress, of commerce and the future was English. Parents wished to give their children the best chance in life, naturally, and therefore they colluded with the system,"" Mr O'Duffy says. Gaelic was rescued from potential extinction when a cultural revival began around the beginning of the 20th century. Later, it was made a compulsory subject in schools. Since then it's gone through periods of progress and recession. Up until a decade ago, Gaelic's future was again in danger, but then interest in the language increased. At a primary school in Clondalkin, in the suburbs of Dublin, children practise their Christmas play in Gaelic. But it's not just music - all their lessons are taught in the Gaelic. The growth in all Irish schools has been phenomenal over the last decade. In Dublin alone, the number of Gaelic schools has grown from 50 to around 200. Ireland's recent economic growth is contributing to the language's revival. With so many job opportunities, people no longer associate Gaelic with poverty and depression. Instead, speaking Irish today is considered fashionable, a trend that is reflected in the country's media. Telefis na Cathair is the country's all Irish television station set up in 1997. Its image is young and trendy, and its mix of lively programmes is helping to transform the perception of the Irish language. Michael D Higgins, the minister responsible for driving its establishment, says that Gaelic is ""shedding its conservative baggage"". Despite the revival, critics say the authorities are not doing enough to ensure the language is used in government departments and in other official capacities. There are also problems with school textbooks, as not enough of them are printed in the Irish language. But despite these issues, Gaelic's future seems a lot more certain than it was a decade ago. Its recent revival reflects a new prosperous and confident Ireland, which no longer associates its native tongue with depression and poverty."
248,"The mosquito is the most dangerous animal in the world, carrying diseases that kill one million people a year. Now the Zika virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, has been linked with thousands of babies born with brain defects in South America. Should the insects be wiped out?  There are 3,500 known species of mosquito but most of those don't bother humans at all, living off plant and fruit nectar.  It's only the females from just 6% of species that draw blood from humans - to help them develop their eggs. Of these just half carry parasites that cause human diseases. But the impact of these 100 species is devastating.  ""Half of the global population is at risk of a mosquito-borne disease,"" says Frances Hawkes from the Natural Resources Institute at the University of Greenwich. ""They have had an untold impact on human misery.""  More than a million people, mostly from poorer nations, die each year from mosquito-borne diseases including malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever.  Some mosquitoes also carry the Zika virus, which was first thought to cause only mild fever and rashes. However, scientists are now worried it can damage babies in the womb. The Zika virus has been linked with a spike in microcephaly - where babies are born with smaller heads - in Brazil.  There's a constant effort to educate people to use treated nets and other tactics to avoid being bitten. But would it just be simpler to make an entire species of disease-carrying mosquito extinct?  Biologist Olivia Judson has supported ""specicide"" of 30 types of mosquito. She said doing this would save one million lives and only decrease the genetic diversity of the mosquito family by 1%. ""We should consider the ultimate swatting,"" she told the New York Times.  In Britain, scientists at Oxford University and the biotech firm Oxitec have genetically modified (GM) the males of Aedes aegypti - a mosquito species that carries both the Zika virus and dengue fever. These GM males carry a gene that stops their offspring developing properly. This second generation of mosquitoes then die before they can reproduce and become carriers of disease themselves.  About three million of these modified mosquitoes were released on to a site on the Cayman Islands between 2009 and 2010. Oxitec reported a 96% reduction in mosquitoes compared with nearby areas. A trial currently taking place on a site in Brazil has reduced the numbers by 92%.  So are there any downsides to removing mosquitoes? According to Phil Lounibos, an entomologist at Florida University, mosquito eradication ""is fraught with undesirable side effects"".  He says mosquitoes, which mostly feed on plant nectar, are important pollinators. They are also a food source for birds and bats while their young - as larvae - are consumed by fish and frogs. This could have an effect further up and down the food chain.  However, some say that the role of mosquito species as food and pollinators would quickly be filled by other insects. ""We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes,"" Judson said.  But for Lounibos, the fact this niche would be filled by another insect is part of the problem. He warns that mosquitoes could be replaced by an insect ""equally, or more, undesirable from a public health viewpoint"". Its replacement could even conceivably spread diseases further and faster than mosquitoes today.  Science writer David Quammen has argued that mosquitoes have limited the destructive impact of humanity on nature. ""Mosquitoes make tropical rainforests, for humans, virtually uninhabitable,"" he said.  Rainforests, home to a large share of our total plant and animal species, are under serious threat from man-made destruction. ""Nothing has done more to delay this catastrophe over the past 10,000 years, than the mosquito,"" Quammen said.  But destroying a species isn't just a scientific issue, it's also a philosophical one. There would be some who would say it is utterly unacceptable to deliberately wipe out a species that is a danger to humans when it is humans that are a danger to so many species.  ""One argument against is that it would be morally wrong to remove an entire species,"" says Jonathan Pugh, from Oxford University's Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.  And yet that's not an argument we apply to all species, says Pugh. ""When we eradicated the Variola virus, which caused smallpox, we rightly celebrated.  ""We need to ask ourselves, does it have any valuable capacities? For instance, is it sentient and therefore has the capacity to suffer pain? Scientists say mosquitoes don't have an emotional response to pain like we do.  ""Also do we have a good reason for getting rid of them? With mosquitoes, they are the main carriers for many diseases.""  The question is likely to remain hypothetical, whatever the level of concern over Zika, malaria and dengue. Despite the success of reducing mosquito numbers in smaller areas, many scientists say knocking out an entire species would be impossible.  ""There's no silver bullet,"" says Hawkes. ""Field trials using GM mosquitoes have been a moderate success but involved releasing millions of modified insects to cover just a small area.  ""Getting every female mosquito to breed with sterile males in a large area would be very difficult. Instead we should be looking to combine this with other techniques.""  Innovative ways of tackling mosquitoes are being developed across the world. Scientists at Kew Gardens in London are developing a sensor that can detect each different species of mosquito from its distinctive wing beat. They plan to equip villagers in rural Indonesia with wearable acoustic detectors to track disease-bearing mosquitoes. This would help them manage future outbreaks.  Meanwhile, scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine have worked out how female mosquitoes are attracted to certain body odours, raising hope for more effective repellents.  Another promising avenue is to make mosquitoes resistant to the parasites that cause the diseases. In Australia, the Eliminate Dengue programme is using naturally occurring bacteria to reduce the ability of mosquitoes to pass dengue between people.  ""This is a more realistic approach for mitigating mosquito-borne disease,"" says Lounibos.  Meanwhile, scientists in the US have bred a GM mosquito with a new gene in the laboratory that makes it resistant to the malaria parasite.  ""We are playing an evolutionary game with mosquitoes,"" says Hawkes. ""Hopefully it's one we can get on top of over the next 10 to 15 years.""

249,"Police forces around the UK could benefit from a system that can detect accidental 999 calls from mobile phones.  The system, called Silent Solutions, has been used by the Metropolitan Police for almost a year to screen out such calls made in London.  More than two million silent calls have been successfully dealt with and £3 million saved thanks to the new system.  Nearly half of all emergency calls made from mobiles are accidental and it has caused a huge headache for police and other emergency services.  All silent calls, where the caller does not specify the emergency service they require, are automatically forwarded to local police forces.  Under the Silent Solutions system, all silent calls received by the 999 switchboard are automatically forwarded to an automated service.  The service plays a recorded message informing the caller that they have been connected to the police at New Scotland Yard.  The message informs the caller that if they require either the police, ambulance, fire brigade or another emergency service they must press the number five on their keypad twice.  If this action is taken the call will be reconnected as a priority to an operator but in the vast majority of cases there is no response and the line is disconnected.  All of the calls are recorded.  ""It's a very important facility to have especially at the Met which has to deal with an enormous number of calls and needs something sophisticated,"" said a spokesperson for ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers).  ""So many false calls are made without the user knowing,"" he added.  The growth of mobile phone use has had a dramatic impact on call handling.  In order to cope with the increase in calls, the Metropolitan Police is receiving £140m of government money to overhaul its 999 call centres, reports Computing magazine.  The aim of the project is to improve the processes behind the 999 service as the number of calls increases.  The central communications information room at New Scotland Yard receives an average of 8,500 emergency calls each day.  Silent Solutions has intercepted around 2,000 calls a day, freeing up valuable police resources to deal with real emergencies.  Since introducing the system, the number of calls answered within 15 seconds has risen from 53% to over 88%.  The majority of accidental emergency calls are made through the knocking of the mobile phone keypad when it is in a bag or pocket.  A European Union directive makes it mandatory for owners to still be able to dial an emergency service even when the keypad on a mobile phone is locked."
250,"Television ratings are 15% up from the 2000 Games in Sydney, while ticket sales have topped figures from the Seoul and Barcelona Olympics.  ""The organisation was outstanding and we had competitions in state-of-the-art venues,"" said Rogge, who described the security precautions as ""flawless"".  ""They really did a fantastic job. I am very, very happy about the Games.  ""We have discovered a new Greece. Greece was great for the Games.  ""These have been unforgettable dream Games. These Games were held in peace and brotherhood. These were the Games where it became increasingly difficult to cheat and where clean athletes were better protected.""  Rogge's predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch had hailed the 2000 Games in Sydney as the greatest Olympiad ever.  But Rogge gave a diplomatic response when asked whether the Athens Games were better.  He said: ""You cannot compare Games that are held at different times and in different countries.""  But despite all the praise, Rogge sent a chilling warning there could be more positive drug tests than the 22 recorded so far in Athens.  ""The list is probably not over,"" said the Belgian. ""You have 10,500 athletes in the Olympic village, you do not have 10,500 saints. You will always have cheats.""  The combined performances of China, Japan and South Korea also impressed Rogge, who described their efforts as the ""awakening of Asia"" and an ominous sign for the rest of the world ahead of the 2008 Games in Beijing."
251,"Adidas, the IAAF's biggest sponsor, has told athletics' world governing body it is to terminate its sponsorship deal four years early.  The sportswear giant informed the IAAF of its decision - understood to be a direct result of the doping scandal sweeping the sport - last week.  Sources say the move will cost the IAAF and its commercial partner Dentsu tens of millions of dollars in revenue.  It is sure to come as a major blow for embattled president Lord Coe.  Neither Adidas nor the IAAF - the International Association of Athletics Federations - confirmed the split but both issued short statements.  They both referenced the ""reform process"" under way as the IAAF attempts to come to terms with a number of damaging revelations.  They also said they were ""in close contact"" with each other, with the IAAF insisting it was in close contact with ""all its sponsors and partners"".  Adidas, which designs and manufactures sports shoes, clothing and accessories, has also expressed its displeasure at the corruption scandal that continues to engulf Fifa.  However, the German firm, which signed a £750m kit sponsorship deal with British football giants Manchester United in 2014, remains the oldest commercial partner of world football's governing body.  The 11-year sponsorship deal with Adidas was set to run until 2019 and was reportedly worth $33m (£23m).  However, sources have told the BBC the figure is much higher - as much, in terms of cash and product, as about $8m (£5.6m) per year.  This means the projected lost revenue for the IAAF and its agency Dentsu over the next four years alone will be more than $30m (£21m).  In August, the IAAF said its projected revenue for 2015 was $42.8m (£30m). For 2016, it said the sum would jump to $81.9m (£57.4m) with added income from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.  ""In terms of finance it is a setback, but it is not fatal. It is a hit they can take,"" said BBC athletics correspondent Mike Costello. ""But it is about perception. This is a hammer blow.""  Adidas is just one of the IAAF's official partners, along with Canon, Toyota, Seiko, TDK, TBS and Mondo.  According to an official press release that accompanied the deal announcement in 2008, the partnership between the IAAF and Adidas incorporated ""every aspect of athletics, from product creation, to grassroots development and retail distribution"".  Under the agreement, Adidas also became the official sponsor of the 2009 World Championships in Berlin.  The BBC understands Adidas informed the IAAF in November it was considering ending their relationship early after a report detailed claims of ""state sponsored doping"" within Russia.  The report was compiled by an independent commission set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).  Earlier this month, the commission's chairman, Dick Pound, delivered a second, damning report that said ""corruption was embedded"" within the IAAF under former president Lamine Diack.  Within days, a decision at the highest level in Adidas was taken to terminate its deal with the IAAF and Dentsu.  The BBC understands termination letters were sent from Adidas to the IAAF and Dentsu last week.  It is understood the German multinational believes the doping revelations in Pound's reports constitute a breach of its agreement with the IAAF.  Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell said the news Adidas was ending its sponsorship deal early would have a major impact on the sport.  ""It's one thing to say we won't be renewing our contract after 2019 but to actually terminate your contract now, seven, eight months before the start of the Olympic Games, this is huge,"" said the Briton.  Sports finance expert Rob Wilson said athletics is perhaps not as important as it once was to Adidas.  ""As one of the largest kit suppliers in the world, sponsorship is vital to Adidas,"" he told BBC Sport.  ""However, it is fair to say the impact of athletics sponsorship is declining and they are moving toward football as a more important area of growth.""  It is not clear if the IAAF will challenge the decision in court, although lawyers at Adidas are understood to be preparing for such a move.  The withdrawal of Adidas will come as a major blow to the sport - and to IAAF president Coe - in a time of unprecedented turmoil.  Coe succeeded Diack in August last year and has come under pressure following the publication of Pound's second report.  Not only did it claim that corruption was ""embedded"" in the IAAF, it also claimed that leading figures within it must have been aware of it.  Coe, who won Olympic 1500m gold at the 1980 and 1984 Games, served as one of four IAAF vice-presidents under Diack for seven years.  Despite the spotlight on Coe, Pound says he ""couldn't think of anyone better"" than the Englishman, 59, to lead athletics out of its crisis.  The Wada reports on state-sponsored doping have left athletics facing an Olympic year with major reputational damage to repair.  It is also facing a French criminal investigation into corruption, which is looking into the awarding of every World Championships since 2007, including London's successful bid to host the event in 2017.  It now seems Adidas believes there is too much reputational risk to its brand to continue its association with the IAAF.  ""I think this comes down to how Adidas are changing their sponsorship approach,"" added Wilson.  ""They are spending millions on the Manchester United deal that is stretching their budgets. To me, this seems more like a repositioning exercise."""
252,"David Low is acclaimed as the 20th Century's greatest cartoonist, the man who scarred the appeasers with his pen, but the public is only now getting to see the originals of his work.  Low's most famous creation, that reactionary caricature Colonel Blimp, entered the dictionary as another lasting legacy of a master satirist.  Now Parliament's Westminster Hall - at the heart of what was once the office of many of Low's victims - is the stage for a major exhibition of his work and the history it depicts.  The exhibition, sponsored by the Political Cartoon Society and BBC History Magazine, opens on Thursday and runs until the end of October. Entry is free.  Tony Banks, chairman of the House of Commons Committee on Works of Art, said Low was a prime example of how cartoonists could be both true artists and significant political commentators.  ""He was exposing the evils of fascism and Nazism when people around this place - and in the newspapers - were ignorant of their menace,"" Mr Banks told BBC News Online.  The Labour MP is himself an avid collector of political cartoons and is bequeathing his collection to Parliament when he dies.  ""It is right we recognise the pivotal position of the cartoonist in politics,"" said Mr Banks.  Wonderful portraits of politicians often did not tell as much as cartoons about the personalities and the political history involved, he argued.  Parliament has contributed some of the cartoons for the exhibition but has hundreds more by other artists, such as James Gillray and John Doyle.  Mr Banks hopes Parliament in future can house that collection in a new museum of political cartoons inside the Palace of Westminster.  Whatever politicans said about being lampooned, they hated it much more when they were not drawn, he added.  Many of Low's most famous works are featured in the exhibition, which aims to portray 40 years of British history through his cartoons.  Among them All Behind You, Winston depicts Churchill's new wartime coalition government in 1940.  And there is the equally famous Very Well Alone - showing Britain fighting on against Germany after France's surrender.  That cartoon is also signed by Churchill, who sent it to the air chief marshal in charge of coastal defence during the Battle of Britain.  There is cutting commentary too of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement stance.  Greg Neale, editor of BBC History Magazine, stressed Low had also brought lesser known issues such as racial prejudice and calls for African independence to public attention.  He argued Low, and other cartoonists, had not only been able to encapsulate the mood of the nation at key periods, but also shape public opinion too.  Born in New Zealand and working in Australia before arriving in Britain in 1919, Low had an outsider's perspective on the UK.  Colonel Blimp was intended to portray all he disliked in British politics - extreme isolationism, impatience with common people and their concerns, and little enthusiasm of democracy.  The character emerged after Low overheard two military men sweating in a Turkish bath talking about how cavalry officers should be able to wear their spurs inside tanks.  Tim Benson, the exhibition's curator, said most of the original cartoons belonged to private collectors and were going on public show for the first time.  The history teacher added: ""Cartoons are a wonderful way of learning about the past."""
253,"They say the lion probably switched from hunting buffalo to humans because it found the meat less painful to chew.  The lion stalked its prey in eight villages in the coastal Rufiji River district over a period of 20 months.  It was finally killed by game scouts in April 2004, around 150km south of the commercial capital Dar es Salaam.  Man-eating lions are not unheard of in Tanzania.  Around 200 people are killed by wild animals each year in Tanzania, a third of those by lions.  It is probably the highest number of deaths ever recorded for one lion.  Since the lion was killed, wildlife researchers have been trying to determine what drove it to kill so many.  And now they have come up with an intriguing theory - that the lion had been suffering from toothache.  When the skull of the lion was examined, a large abscess was discovered under one of its molar teeth, which was cracked into many pieces.  ""It probably gave up hunting wild animals like buffalo because the meat was just too tough and too painful to chew. It almost certainly found humans easier to catch and less painful to eat.""  There is of course no scientific proof for the toothache theory.  One of the main problems facing scientists researching the behaviour of man-eating lions is that the lions themselves are seldom caught and so analysis is extremely rare.  One fact that many lion authorities do agree on, however, is that it is not just old lions who are unable to hunt effectively who turn into man-eaters.  The Rufiji lion was just three and a half years old - a young adult.  ""This lion was probably taught to hunt humans by its mother when it was young. Perhaps it gave up hunting humans until it got toothache but then restarted,"" Mr Baldus said.  This is partly due to the large areas of wilderness lions can roam in but also the Tanzanian government's policy of protecting them and managing them sustainably through controlled hunting.  Most attacks on humans have taken place in the south of the country. It is a trend which experts are yet to fully understand.  The capture and shooting of the Rufiji River lion does not of course mean that attacks against humans will stop in the district.  Its death has however, according to Dr Baldus, put the conservation of lions and the relationship with local people back on the agenda.  ""Care must be taken that rural people benefit more from the wildlife they live alongside. This will serve as a powerful incentive to tolerate and even conserve them."""
254,"Mauritius, an Indian Ocean archipelago, is seen as a model of stability and economic prosperity in the region.  Once dependent on sugar exports, the island has built up a strong outsourcing and financial services sector, and an important tourism industry and now boasts one of Africa's highest per capita incomes.  Mauritius claims sovereignty over the Chagos islands, arguing that the archipelago was illegally detached from Mauritius before its independence.  The Chagos islands lie around 1,000 km to the north-east and are home to the US military base on Diego Garcia. Several hundred islanders were expelled to make way for the base.  Ameenah Gurib was sworn in as president of Mauritius in June 2015, becoming the first woman to hold the ceremonial position.  She replaced Kailash Purryag, who was chosen by the previous Labour Party government in 2012 and resigned in May 2015 following the election victory of the alliance led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth in December 2014.  An internationally-renowned scientist and biologist, Mrs Gurib is an expert in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.  Pravind Kumar Jugnauth succeeded his father, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, as prime minister in January 2017.  Until he stepped down, Sir Anerood Jugnauth had been the longest-serving prime minister since Mauritius gained independence from Britain in 1968.  Mr Jugnauth is leader of the governing Militant Socialist Movement party and is also concurrently serving as minister of finance and interior.  State-owned Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) radio and TV generally reflect government thinking. MBC is funded by advertising and a TV licence fee.  Television is the most popular medium.

Abolition of slavery sees thousands of indentured labourers recruited, mainly from India.  1966 - Britain expels hundreds of residents of the Chagos archipelago to make way for a US military base on Diego Garcia. Many are sent to Mauritius.  2014 - Parliament dissolved to allow a constitutional amendment and provide for the direct election of the president"
255,"The location work in London was in the can and filming for Terry Gilliam's latest production had been about to move to Vancouver in Canada. Then came the untimely death of actor Heath Ledger.  Ledger, 28, had been the biggest name on the cast list of Gilliam's work in progress, the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, and, according to co-star Christopher Plummer, the American-born director had been a ""very good friend"" of Ledger's.  As tributes poured in for the actor, the future of the $30m (£15.4m) film lay in doubt. ""'Parnassus' is shut down,"" said the Hollywood Reporter. But while Plummer speculated to the press that Ledger could be digitally recreated to finish the film, Gilliam seems to have been hatching a more creative solution - enlisting three big name actors to play incarnations of Ledger's character.  According to Jude Law's spokeswoman, Law, Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp will play the role of Ledger's character, Tony, in the film, subject to negotiation. It is thought that original footage of Ledger will remain.  The plan lends a new twist to a problem that has dogged filmmakers since the early days of cinema - how to complete a movie when one of the headliners dies before it's a wrap.  While Gilliam's close friendship with Ledger appears to be an important motivator in his wish to complete Parnassus, the bottom line is often a more compelling reason to keep rolling.  As casting director Carol Dudley recalls being on the MGM lot during the aftershock of Natalie Wood's death, while making Brainstorm in 1981.  ""People wanted to get their money back. They had to find a way to make it work.""  The film was completed with a stand-in and clever camera angles designed to obscure the fact that the screen siren in the frame was not the same as the name which graced the posters for the film.  The body double approach to making up for a death in service has been around at least since 1937 when Jean Harlow died, aged 26, during the making of Saratoga. With filming 90% complete, a lookalike and two Harlow sound-a-likes (voice doubles) took up where the star left off.  But in those days before computer-generated imagery (CGI), pulling off the body double trick convincingly was a tall order - never more so than in the notorious B-movie Plan 9 From Outer Space. Director Ed Wood had only bagged about two minutes of footage of lead actor Bela Lugosi for the film when the actor died of a heart attack.  Undeterred, Wood rewrote the script and enlisted chiropractor Tom Mason, who stood a foot taller than Lugosi, for the role. Wood tried to conceal the stark difference in height between the two men by having the stand-in stoop. As for the lack of facial similarity, Mason cloaked his face with a Dracula-like cape.  The film was panned, but Dan Jolin, features editor of Empire magazine, says it was all part of Wood's charm.  ""Ed Wood was a singular filmmaker and wouldn't let anything stop him from making the film he wanted to make. It's so obvious the guy standing in for him is a different height. But in a film with wobbly gravestones and flying saucers hanging from bits of string it actually works.""  The advent of CGI lent a more professional edge to filling in for newly deceased actors. Probably the first film to use computers to this effect, says Jolin, was John Candy's last movie, Wagons East.  ""They finished the film without him and used footage of him that was tweaked but it was weird and uneven and it felt like Candy wasn't really in it.""  By the time of Oliver Reed's death, on the set of Gladiator, in 1999, computer effects had progressed to such an extent that Reed's living, breathing absence was barely noticeable. If there was a crack, says Jolin, it was more in the continuity.  ""The only slightly jarring thing was [Reed] was going to live in the film. There was a line he said to Russell Crowe in the film and that was used as the final line and it felt clunky.""  By comparison, Gilliam's novel solution to Ledger's death is consciously low-tech. But the director's biographer, Bob McCabe, says he believes the solution is a ""brilliant idea"" and characteristic of Gilliam's ""fantastic imagination"".  ""If you are a filmmaker you have a responsibility to try to get the film made, but it has to be true to itself.""  Carol Dudley notes Gilliam's idea would be unthinkable in a ""straight thriller. [But] filmmakers like Terry Gilliam are walking a line between hyper-reality and fantasy and so can get away with this sort of idea.""  ""It's something his films can rise to,"" says Dudley. ""Why not make lemonade from the lemon rather than sweep it under the carpet.""  I have seen Brainstorm countless times and, being unaware of the fact that Wood died during filming, have never noticed her absence.  Nancy Bang, Esbjerg, Denmark  Bruce Lee's last film, Game Of Death, features stand-in doubles, cardboard cutouts, and an actor wearing a paper mask with Bruce's photograph printed on it!  Andy, London  It's worth mentioning the first effective use of CGI to complete a film where one of the leads has ""died in service"" was The Crow. After Brandon Lee's tragic death, the film was completed using digital composites from existing footage of Lee.   Dermot Canniffe, Galway, Ireland  I find it amazing what can be achieved these days. I recall watching The Crow - where Brandon Lee died mid-way through filming - and being totally unable to see what is 'genuine' Brandon and the late fill-ins. I'm sure Gilliams fix will be most effective. I just continue to find it very sad that events have occurred which means he has to do this.   Merson Tuffers, Staffs, UK  The notion that Gilliam's solution is novel though, I find hard to believe. Its seems very similar to the idea of 'I'm Not There' - the film in which Heath Ledger himself was just one of the actors playing the character of Bob Dylan along with the likes of Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett.   Charlie, Cambridge  Gilliam's idea is nothing new - David Lynch did it purposely in 'Lost Highway', when Bill Pullman's character is incarcerated, and the next morning has transformed into Balthazar Getty, playing a completely different character - baffling both the police and the audience in typical Lynch fashion.   Martin Conaghan, Glasgow  It's nice to see the film industry using an idea first introduced in Doctor Who. But I bet they won't acknowledge it!  Mick Clarke, Elland West Yorkshire"
256,"Afghanistan's Chief Justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told the Associated Press news agency no evidence had been produced against him.  ""Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin ... he is a free man,"" he said.  The Taleban Information Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, said the Taleban had now fulfilled their obligations concerning Osama bin Laden.  However, he said the Taleban had ordered him not to use Afghan soil for any activities against other countries and that he had accepted this.  Mr Muttaqi said that if from now on, any country raised the issue with the Taleban it would be viewed as an illogical excuse for attacking Afghanistan.  Earlier this month, the Taleban challenged the United States to provide evidence to back its allegations that the militant Saudi millionaire had masterminded the bombing of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  Shortly after the embassy bombings in August, the US launched cruise missile attacks against what it said were Osama bin Laden training camps in south Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan.  Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan for several years. He was involved in the fight against the Soviet occupying forces in the 1980s and was considered a hero for his part in this holy war, or Jihad.  He left Afghanistan after the Soviet army pulled out, ending up in Sudan. But moved on again after US pressure on the Sudanese Government.  He returned to Afghanistan, where is believed to have remained to this day, as a ""guest"" of the Islamic militia.  The American government offered a reward of $5m for his arrest, but the Taleban say that, as a Muslim, bin Laden should be tried in a Muslim country.  ""It is not just to try a Muslim man in front of a non-Muslim court,"" the Afghan foreign minister said."
257,"Both are world-famous authors who wrote some of their best known works in their sheds. But, as Roald Dahl's centenary is celebrated across the country, his widow reveals how heavily the children's author was influenced by Dylan Thomas's hut when building his own.  They are two writers famous for completely different types of writing.  Roald Dahl is celebrated for his imaginative children's stories, and Dylan Thomas for his poetry.  But it was Thomas who Dahl turned to for inspiration when he struggled to sit down and write in his house.  As a father of young children and with a bustling home, Cardiff-born Dahl initially found it hard to shut himself off and write.  Finding too many distractions in his house, he remembered fellow Welshman Dylan Thomas, who he called ""the greatest poet of our time"", had found a peaceful shed to write in close to home.  Thomas wrote works such as Under Milk Wood, Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night, Over Sir John's Hill and Poem on His Birthday inside his hut.  The writing shed was a former garage teetering on the edge of a cliff, with a view of the hills, the town of Laugharne and the Taf estuary below.  Dahl travelled to visit Thomas's hut in Carmarthenshire in the 1950s and, peering through the window, decided to make a replica of it to write in.  Surrounded by pictures (1), inspirational quotes and photos of family and friends (2), Dahl sat in a wing-back chair, which used to be his mother's, with a hole cut in it to relieve the pressure on an abscess he developed in his back (3).  While writing, he rested his legs on a battered suitcase, covering them with a sleeping bag when they got cold (4).  The writer used a cardboard tube with a piece of wood propped on top to work at, writing purely with pencils on yellow paper (8). He had a rubbish bin on one side for rejected pages (7), and a filing cabinet and books on the other (5).  His desk was a place for mementoes to inspire him, with objects such as the hip bone he kept after a hip replacement, and a ball made out of silver foil chocolate wrappers (9).  Although Dahl based the design of his hut on Thomas's shed, there was one major difference - the lack of natural light. He often kept his curtains drawn (10) to block out the outside world and was dependant on an angle-poise lamp (6) for light.  Dahl's widow Felicity said: ""He realised he had to have a space of his own in the garden away from the children and the noise and the general domesticity and he remembered that Dylan had felt the same.  ""And so he went down to Wales to look at Dylan's writing hut and, like everybody, fell in love with it.""  Built to the same proportions, with the same angled roof - the similarities could be a coincidence. But according to his widow it was built in a similar design by Dahl's builder friend Wally Saunders, who the BFG was based on.  ""He built it exactly to the same proportions as Dylan's hut, the same roof, one skin of brick,"" said Mrs Dahl. ""Of course Dylan's hut was a garage originally, whereas Roald had nothing, it was an empty space that he built on.""  While Dahl wrote in semi-darkness, Thomas had large windows (10) to take in the beautiful view from his writing shed perched on stilts on the cliff above the boathouse, where he lived in Laugharne.  Built as a garage by a previous owner, the poet filled his ""word-splashed hut"" with curled pictures of Byron, Walt Whitman, Louis MacNeice, WH Auden (1 and 2) as well as lists of alliterative words beside his pencil pot (8).  He sat on a simple chair (3) writing on paper (4), while throwing rejected pages onto the floor (5).  Like Dahl, he kept books on hand (6), mementoes to inspire him (9) and he also kept a supply of boiled sweets on his desk (7).  She said: ""It was so similar to Roald's hut. Everything was very simple, and Roald was like that, he didn't want rich yachts, he wanted a simple life, he was a countryman, again, like Dylan.""  Dahl wrote many of his books in the hut in the garden of his home Gipsy House in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, which was recently moved to the nearby Roald Dahl Story Museum at a cost of £500,000.  Describing his writing shed on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs programme in 1979, Dahl described the haven he had created.  He said: ""A little hut, curtains drawn so I don't see the squirrels up in the apple trees in the orchard. The light on, right away from the house, no vacuum cleaners, nothing.""  He added: ""When I am in this place it is my little nest. My womb."""
258,"The message inside ""the world's most mysterious medieval manuscript"" has eluded cryptographers, mathematicians and linguists for over a century.  And for many, the so-called Voynich book is assumed to be a hoax.  But a new study, published in the journal Plos One, suggests the manuscript may, after all, hold a genuine message.  Scientists say they found linguistic patterns they believe to be meaningful words within the text.  Whether or not it really does have any meaningful information, though, is much debated by amateurs and professionals alike.  It was even investigated by a team of prominent code breakers during WWII who successfully cracked complex encrypted enemy messages, but they failed to find meaning in the text.  The book has been dated to the early 1400s, but it largely disappeared from public record until 1912 when an antique book dealer called Wilfrid Voynich bought it amongst a number of second-hand publications in Italy.  Marcelo Montemurro, a theoretical physicist from the University of Manchester, UK, has spent many years analysing its linguistic patterns and says he hopes to unravel the manuscript's mystery, which he believes his new research is one step closer to doing.  ""The text is unique, there are no similar works and all attempts to decode any possible message in the text have failed. It's not easy to dismiss the manuscript as simple nonsensical gibberish, as it shows a significant [linguistic] structure,"" he told BBC News.  ""There are about 25 examinations of the Voynich manuscript and most of the results show the text has similarities with natural language. This new examination is one more of this kind,"" says Klaus Schmeh, a cryptographer. ""While we know a lot about the statistical properties of the text, we don't know enough about how to interpret them, which is one of the problems with the new research. We need to find out how different languages, encryption methods, and text types influence the statistics. ""There have been numerous encrypted texts since the Middle Ages and 99.9% have been cracked. If you have a whole book, as here, it should be 'quite easy' as there is so much material for analysts to work with. That it has never been decrypted is a strong argument for the hoax theory.""  Dr Montemurro and a colleague used a computerised statistical method to analyse the text, an approach that has been known to work on other languages.  They focused on patterns of how the words were arranged in order to extract meaningful content-bearing words.  ""There is substantial evidence that content-bearing words tend to occur in a clustered pattern, where they are required as part of the specific information being written,"" he explains.  ""Over long spans of texts, words leave a statistical signature about their use. When the topic shifts, other words are needed.  ""The semantic networks we obtained clearly show that related words tend to share structure similarities. This also happens to a certain degree in real languages.""  Dr Montemurro believes it unlikely that these features were simply ""incorporated"" into the text to make a hoax more realistic, as most of the required academic knowledge of these structures did not exist at the time the Voynich manuscript was created.  Though he has found a pattern, what the words mean remains a mystery. The very fact that a century of brilliant minds have analysed the work with little progress means some believe a hoax is the only likely explanation.  Gordon Rugg, a mathematician from Keele University, UK, is one such academic. He has even produced his own complex code deliberately similar to ""Voynichese"" to show how a text can appear to have meaningful patterns, even though it is ""gibberish hoax text"".  He says the new findings do not rule out the hoax theory, which the researchers argue.  ""The findings aren't anything new. It's been accepted for decades that the statistical properties of Voynichese are similar, but not identical, to those of real languages.  ""I don't think there's much chance that the Voynich manuscript is simply an unidentified language, because there are too many features in its text that are very different from anything found in any real language.""  Gordon Rugg does not believe it contains an unknown code, which is another theory of what the text may be: ""Some of the features of the manuscript's text, such as the way that it consists of separate words, are inconsistent with most methods of encoding text. Modern codes almost invariably avoid having separate words, as those would be an easy way to crack most coding systems.""  As to its enduring appeal, an unsolved cipher could be ""hiding almost anything"", says Craig Bauer, author of Secret History: The Story of Cryptology.  ""It could solve a major crime, reveal buried treasure worth millions or in the case of the Voynich manuscript, rewrite the history of science,"" he adds.  Dr Bauer's opinion of whether it is meaningful is often swayed, he admits. While he recently believed it to be a hoax, the new analysis has now shifted his opinion.  But despite this, he still believes it is a made up language, as opposed to a real naturally evolving one, or ""it would have been broken years ago"".  ""However, I still feel that it's very much an open question and I may change my mind a few times before a proof is obtained one way or the other.""  But Dr Montemurro is firm in his belief, and argues that the hoax hypothesis cannot possibly explain the semantic patterns he has discovered.  He is aware that his analysis leaves many questions still unanswered, such as whether it is an encoded version of a known language or whether a totally invented language.  ""After this study, any new support for the hoax hypothesis should address the emergence of this sophisticated structure explicitly. So far, this has not been done.  ""There must be a story behind it, which we may never know,"" Dr Montemurro adds."
259,"Muttiah Muralitharan has been revealed as the top Test bowler in history, ranking alongside top batsman Don Bradman, according to cricket bible Wisden.  Wisden's statistical analysis of every single Test match put the Sri Lankan three places ahead of his Australian spin rival Shane Warne.  Between them are New Zealand's Richard Hadlee, and Sydney Barnes, whose 189 for England between 1901/02 - 1913/14 brought an average of 16.43 - the lowest of 20th century Test cricketers.  In 78 Tests, Muralitharan has 437 wickets - third behind Courtney Walsh and Warne - at an average of 23.52.  His ranking, ""emphasises the lone-wolf role he has played in Sri Lankan cricket for so long,"" according to Wisden.com editor Steven Lynch.  Muralitharan, currently in Brisbane with the Sri Lanka side, was surprised by the news.  ""No.1 is a great honour and I don't rank myself so high,"" he said.  The spinner has been dogged by accusations of throwing, but his bowling action has been cleared due to a congenitally deformed arm.  ""What I have gone through shouldn't happen to any other bowler, whether it be Brett Lee or Shoaib Akhtar,"" he said.  ""It is very hard to keep going when everyone is looking at you all the time but everything is past and gone.""  Bradman is followed by Sachin Tendulkar of India and West Indian pair Viv Richards and Garfield Sobers. Australia's Allan Border, with the most Test career runs with 11,174, is fifth.  The list's compilers took such factors as the strength of opposition and the importance of each performance. Players were also rewarded for consistency over long careers.  ""The expected score for a top performer was around 1000 points - and The Don managed 1349,"" said Lynch.  ""Just like his fabulous Test batting average of 99.94, this deservedly left him way clear of the field.""  Wisden caused controversy two years ago when its statistical ranking of the top 100 Test innings did not include a single appearance by Indian legend Tendulkar.  Richards was reckoned the best batsman in one-day international cricket, while Pakistan's Wasim Akram is the best limited-overs bowler."
260,"A man who apparently tried to blow himself up on a transatlantic flight is one of about 100 would-be suicide bombers, according to the chairman of a London mosque he attended. Richard Reid is in custody in the United States after allegedly trying to set off a bomb in his shoe during a Paris-Miami flight at the weekend. The FBI said it would be charging Mr Reid, 28, with assault and intimidation of the crew of American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami. He is due in court on Friday. The Boston Globe newspaper said the FBI believed Mr Reid was part of a ""wider network"" of Islamic extremists. Abdul Haqq Baker, chairman of Brixton mosque in south London, has told the BBC that Mr Reid, who is believed to be of Anglo-Jamaican heritage, came to the mosque to learn about Islam but soon fell in with what he called ""more extreme elements"". Mr Baker said Mr Reid had converted to Islam while serving time in a British prison for minor offences.    You would have at least 100 or more individuals who would be prepared to do that (blow themselves up)    He said Mr Reid took the name, Abdel Rahim, and came to the mosque for instruction in mainstream Islam, initially taking a studious approach. But he said he later became convinced his teachers were too ""passive"" in the face of perceived Western injustice. He said he came into contact with ""more extreme elements"" in London's Muslim community, started wearing military gear and talking about fighting a jihad or holy war. Mr Baker said: ""He said we had to revolt against the rulers of the Muslim countries, because they were not actually Muslims."" He said Mr Reid said Muslims who lived in Western society should make plans to revolt against and undermine it. Mr Baker said there were perhaps as many as 1,000 extremist Muslims in the UK, of whom at least 100 were ready to become suicide bombers. He said: ""Those propagating the extreme views are relatively few in number but in the last four or five years we have witnessed that number grow quite frighteningly."" Mr Baker said: ""They prey on impressionable youth, those who are new to Islam, those whose understanding of Islam is not that advanced, and those who are quite weak in their character, and have to be led."" When searched Mr Reid was apparently found to have ""two functional explosive devices"" in his shoes, which contained C-4, a type of plastic explosive. The suspect had reportedly been prevented from boarding a similar flight in Paris the previous day because he was acting suspiciously. Shadow home secretary Oliver Letwin has called on airports to face up to the new kind of threat posed by suicide bombers. Mr Letwin said this latest incident raised questions about security and nationality. He said: ""As we discovered on 11 September, there are now people who are trying to do very great damage to our society who are willing to kill themselves in the process. ""I suspect that airport security hasn't quite caught up with that ghastly phenomenon."""
261,"On 21 June, 1940, more than 1,300 bewildered children arrived in Glasgow - a city most of them had never even heard of.  Only two days before, these youngsters had been enjoying a carefree afternoon, swimming or playing after school on the beautiful and peaceful island of Guernsey.  The Channel Islands had been largely unaffected by the start of the war.  But that summer, the sound and flashes of gunfire could be seen and heard across the sea in nearby France. The German army was advancing.  The British government decided the Channel Islands could no longer be defended.  On Guernsey, all children aged five to 14 were evacuated, unless their parents chose to keep them with them.  It was the stuff of nightmares.  To send your children away to an unknown place, in the hope they'd be taken in by strangers - not knowing when, or even if, you'd see them again.  In the middle of the night, at schools around the island, parents hugged their youngsters and waved them off.  Clutching pillowslips or bags containing a couple of vests, pants and socks, perhaps a favourite toy, something to eat on the journey, the children were bundled on to buses.  They were driven to an assortment of waiting ships in the harbour, many coming straight from the Dunkirk landings.  Arriving on the south coast of England hours later, they were checked over, fed and watered and bundled onto trains heading north.  Most of these young people had never been on a ship before. They'd never left the island.  They'd never seen a train, a busy road - or a black and white cow.  The youngest were terrified, grief-stricken and missing their families. They'd left behind everything and everyone they'd ever known.  Some of the older kids regarded it as all as a bit of an adventure. For the teachers and helpers accompanying them, it was an onerous responsibility.  Church halls around the city of Glasgow had been preparing for the mass influx.  At St Ninian's on the south side, rows of beds were lined up.  Volunteers were on hand to welcome the evacuees. It was ironic, when so many of Glasgow's own children had already been sent out of the city.  Over the coming days and weeks, the majority of children were billeted with families who offered them a temporary home.  But siblings were often separated, and many of the placements were far from successful and hugely traumatic. For many, it was a lonely and unhappy time.  The bustling, dirty, noisy city and the strange accent were a world away from the sea and sands of Guernsey.  Others settled in quickly, welcomed by loving families. They thrived on the excitement of the big schools, buses and trams, cinemas, dance halls, and holidays in the likes of Rothesay.  Most of the evacuees who spent the rest of the war in Scotland did their growing up in their five years here.  Back on Guernsey, the Germans had invaded within hours of the evacuation.  Under German occupation life was hard - made worse by the worry over what had happened to the island's children.  It was months before most parents heard that their offspring were alive and being cared for in Scotland.  Telegrams from the Red Cross were the only form of communication for the remainder of the war.  A maximum of 25 words, sent through the organisation in Geneva, provided treasured news.  These carefully worded, coded messages are a poignant reminder of that long separation.  In 1945, at the end of the war, the majority of the children made the return trip home to families who barely recognised their grown-up, independent offspring.  They'd come back to Guernsey ""talking Scotch"" and telling stories of a very different life.  Many missed their adopted families in Scotland, and maintained contacts with friends made there throughout their lives.  Now in their 70s and 80s, they can look back on a time and experience which shaped their lives."
262,"The polls have closed after Tunisia's first presidential election since the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" that triggered uprisings across the region.  About 54% of the electorate took part, with no reports of any violence.  Interim president Moncef Marzouki and anti-Islamist leader Beji Caid Essebsi were touted as the favourites in a field of more than 25 candidates.  Both campaigns claimed to have won the most votes but admitted that a second round of voting next month was likely.  The official results are due out later this week and if no candidate wins more than 50%, a run-off will be held on 31 December.  The poll forms part of a political transition after the revolution that ousted Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.  Tunisia - seen as the birthplace of the Arab Spring - is considered to have had the most successful outcome, with relatively low levels of violence.  Sunday's election will deliver the country's first directly elected leader since the removal of Mr Ben Ali. Most polling stations were open for 10 hours from 08:00 (07:00 GMT).  ""We were the first to enter this cycle of change which they have called the Arab Spring,"" Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa was quoted as saying on the eve of the poll.  ""We will be the first [to make the transition] but others will follow,"" he added.  Mr Essebsi, who is from the Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia's Call) party, came out on top in the poll, according to one of his officials.  ""Essebsi is ahead according to initial results, with a big difference to the next candidate,"" campaign manager Mohsen Marzouk told reporters, but he admitted there was ""a strong possibility of a second round"".  Mr Essebsi was the frontrunner after his party came first in the parliamentary election.  But critics say the 87-year-old, who served in the governments of post-independence leader Habib Bourguiba as well as Mr Ben Ali, represents the past.  ""Tunisians will have their say and I will accept their choice to consolidate Tunisia's transition,"" Mr Essebsi told reporters after voting in Tunis.  Correspondents say his main opposition came from Mr Marzouki, the interim president and a human rights campaigner who has cast himself as a guardian of the spirit of the revolution.  Mr Marzouki's camp insisted the contest was neck and neck, with their candidate possibly ahead by a small margin.  ""At the worst we are even but at best we're between 2 and 4% ahead,"" Mr Marzouki's campaign manager Adnene Mancer told reporters. ""Our chances are good as we go into a runoff.""  Among the other candidates were Parliamentary Speaker Mustapha Ben Jaafar, Republican Party leader Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, female magistrate Kalthoum Kannou and businessman Slim Riahi.  The Islamist party Ennahda, which led Tunisia's last government but was beaten by Nidaa Tounes in October's parliamentary election, did not field a candidate.  A statement from Ennahda leader Rachid Ghannouchi spoke of wanting ""to avoid deepening polarisation or dividing the country"". Ennahda's rise had led to concerns among more secular-minded Tunisians that Islamists would dominate politics.  Tunisia is still facing the spectre of civil unrest and terrorism, with Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou warning of ""serious security threats"" near the Algerian border where al-Qaeda militants are said to be hiding."

The host of RuPaul's Drag Race told Hollywood Today Live he and Georges LeBar tied the knot in January, 23 years to the day they first met at New York's Limelight nightclub.

264,"Following the Hamas military takeover of Gaza last week, there are now effectively two governments in the Palestinian territories.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Fatah) sacked the Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and his government and replaced it with an emergency government of mainly technocrats.  In Hamas-controlled Gaza, Mr Haniya insists that he is still prime minister, while in the West Bank, a Fatah stronghold, President Abbas says that the emergency government is legitimate - something that Israel, the Arab League and the West agree upon.  The US and the EU are to normalise ties with the new Palestinian government and lift the economic embargo to support an administration without Hamas.  What was the embargo's effect and how did it work?  When Hamas entered government in March 2006, Israel and the Quartet powers - the US, EU, UN and Russia - imposed an economic embargo on the administration because of its refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist.  The embargo had a devastating impact on the Palestinian economy and meant that many of the Palestinian Authority's 160,000 employees have not received their full pay in over a year.  To circumvent the Hamas-led administration, the international community deposited money in the bank account of President Abbas. The Fatah movement, which recognises Israel, is regarded as moderate by the West.  Western countries started to make payments to the Palestinians through a scheme called Tim - the temporary international mechanism.  Again, this bypassed the Hamas-led administration by depositing money into the accounts of individual Palestinians meaning that some salaries - particularly of key workers, such as doctors and nurses - could be paid.  In March, Hamas and Fatah formed a government of national unity which they hoped would get the economic embargo lifted - it was not.  But the events in Gaza last week - and the creation of two governments - have changed this position.  What happens now in the West Bank?  The US, the EU, and Israel have all said they will lift the economic embargo on the emergency government.  This means that money will go directly to the Palestinian ministries, although how much is not clear.  The West will continue to fund individual Palestinians through the Tim.  International organisations - such as the UN - will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to ordinary Palestinians.  Israel says that it will handover about $800m (£400m) of custom taxes it collects on behalf of the Palestinians to the emergency government.  According to an Israeli official this will be done in several stages but it is not clear how quickly that will happen.  What happens now in Gaza?  In Gaza, the Hamas-led administration will still be subject to the economic embargo by the Quartet powers.  No money will go directly to the any of the ministries in the territory.  Israel refuses to hand over any of the tax customs it collects on behalf of the Palestinians to the Hamas administration.  International organisations - such as the UN - will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to ordinary Palestinians.  Both the international community and Israel insist that they do not want a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  The US also announced $40m of emergency aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), which runs relief efforts in Gaza.  Last week, all the crossings into the territory were closed by Israel.  But on Tuesday, eight truckloads of humanitarian aid was permitted to enter the territory. On Monday, some medical supplies were delivered.  The EU will continue to pay some Gazans through the Tim.  Israel has said that it will continue to supply electricity, fuel and water to the impoverished territory.  But it will not hand over the tax customs it collects on behalf of the Palestinians to any Hamas administration.  There is a strong possibility that President Abbas will want to help the Palestinians in Gaza.  But it is unclear how the West and Israel would view the emergency government if it passed money to any Hamas administration.  They may want to re-impose the economic embargo.  Hamas members have brought sums of cash into Gaza donated from the Arab and Muslim world in the past. They may try to do this again.  But it is difficult to see how the Hamas administration can function effectively with the economic embargo still imposed."
265,"North Korea has staged lavish celebrations to mark the 60th birthday of its leader, Kim Jong-il.  The capital Pyongyang put on a mass gymnastics display on Saturday involving about 10,000 young people.  Parades, rallies and concerts were also held, and Kim Jong-il's name was carved in letters 34 metres high into a cliff at Mount Kumgang, just north of the demilitarised zone.  The celebrations took place despite North Korea's serious economic difficulties, with up to a third of the population dependent on international food aid.  Kim came to power in 1994 after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, and a huge cult of personality has been built up around them.  Their birthdays are regarded as North Korea's most important national holidays - and a 60th birthday is regarded as an important milestone in East Asia, marking the renewal of the calendar cycle. Live pictures of birthday events were broadcast on state television and newspapers gave wide coverage to tributes to Kim. Reuters news agency said that at a celebratory concert, children danced and performed acrobatics to martial music under a huge screen that mixed images of gunfire with a picture of a smiling Kim in military uniform. But despite all the razzamatazz, there were no reports of Kim Jong-il appearing in public on Saturday.  Until two years ago he remained one of the world's most reclusive leaders - rarely seen, let alone heard in public. That changed when he held a historic summit with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, and hosted a visit by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Correspondents say Kim Jong-il's years in power so far have coincided with precipitous economic decline and starvation, brought on by natural disasters and mismanagement of the state-controlled economy. And the festive mood is overshadowed by President Bush's comments branding North Korea part of an axis of evil, supporting terrorism and producing weapons of mass destruction. North Korea has condemned the speech, saying it increases the risk of war on the Korean peninsula."
266,"A report on the BBC TV programme Newsnight showed Israeli experts in northern Iraq, drilling Kurdish militias in shooting techniques.  Kurdish officials have refused to comment on the report and Israel has denied it knows of any involvement.  The revelation is set to cause enormous problems for the Kurds, not only in Iraq but also in the wider region.  Israel is seen as an enemy of Arabs and Muslims, both inside Iraq and elsewhere in Arab and Muslim countries.  Kurdish politicians will most likely come under pressure to explain what their semi-autonomous government has been up to.  Israeli security experts who spoke to the BBC said they could not have worked inside Kurdistan without the knowledge of the Kurdish authorities.  The news will most probably increase tension between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab population, both Sunnis and Shias, reinforcing fears that the Kurds are pursuing a secessionist agenda.  This would be a serious blow to efforts for national reconciliation at a time when hundreds of Iraqis are killed every month in inter-communal violence.  Iraq's neighbours, too, will be outraged.  Iran and Syria, which have long accused the Kurds of allowing the Israelis to operate on Iraqi territory, will most likely demand an explanation from the government in Baghdad.  The Israeli government says it is conducting an investigation into the BBC report because it is against Israeli law to export military know-how without prior permission.  The BBC report will be like the smoking gun the Arab media has spent years looking for.  Ever since the US-led invasion of Iraq began over three years ago, Arab journalists have been speaking of Israelis operating inside the autonomous region of Kurdistan.  They said this was evidence that toppling Saddam Hussein was only the first chapter in a wider American-Israeli conspiracy to eliminate threats to their strategic interests and re-draw the map of the Middle East.  Syria and Iran, which have common borders with Kurdish areas, are believed to be the primary target."
267,"Dennis Bergkamp was put off flying for life after an engine cut out during a flight to the USA 94 World Cup. Former Arsenal team-mate Lee Dixon revealed that the experience had left the Holland international afraid to take to the air again. Bergkamp has been a notable absentee from Arsenal's away games in their previous Champions League campaigns. But the in-form Gunners striker has made the journey to his homeland by car so that he can face PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday. ""Dennis had a bad flight to the USA 94 World Cup with the Dutch national team,"" Dixon told BBC Radio Five Live. ""I think there was something wrong with the engine. It all seems a bit mystical but he doesn't talk about it an awful lot.    It's the luck of the draw and fortunately there are couple of games that Dennis can travel to this time    ""But that's the reason why I think he decided that flying wasn't for him and fair play to him. ""He made that decision and he has stuck by it. ""Everyone at the club has stuck by him and there is no anomosity towards him in the squad and everyone respects his view. ""He made that decision with his family and told the manager how he felt. ""The club respected him and told Dennis that they would try to get him to as many games as possible. ""It's just the games involving the long European trips that he misses. It's the luck of the draw and fortunately there are a couple of games that Dennis can travel to."" Dixon added that Bergkamp could make all the difference to Arsenal's progress in the Champions League this season following the disappointment of recent years. The Gunners have failed to make it past the quarter-finals in their four previous appearances. ""Even when Dennis is perhaps not on song and not playing as well as he can, he's always a big boost when he plays because he's able to produce something out of the ordinary,"" he added. ""You see it day in day out in training. When you have a player of that ability, it is great to have him on the bench and more importantly in the team. ""Travelling does take it out of you. But knowing Dennis, he will declare himself fit to play in the game against Leeds on Saturday."""
268,"      Aspects of Iain Duncan Smith's CV, relating to his education, are inaccurate and misleading, an investigation by BBC Newsnight reveals.    The investigation into the Conservative Party leader's education and early career - broadcast at 10.30pm on BBC TWO last night (Wednesday 18 December 2002) - was presented by Michael Crick, author of the best-selling biography of Jeffrey Archer.    If any of the following material is used BBC Newsnight must be credited.       Iain Duncan Smith's biography on the Conservative Party website, his entry in Who's Who, and various other places, state that he went to the Universita di Perugia in Italy.    This is not true: his office now admit that he went to the Universita per Stranieri, which is also in Perugia.    The Universita per Stranieri - or University for Foreigners - was founded in 1921 and is a totally separate institution to the medieval Universita di Perugia, founded by the Pope in 1308.    Although the Universita per Stranieri is a respected language school, it did not grant degrees when he studied there in 1973, although some students attained diplomas.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now admitted to Newsnight that he didn't get any qualifications in Perugia or even finish his exams.       The first line of Iain Duncan Smith's biography, on the Conservative Party website, claims he was ""educated at Dunchurch College of Management"".    In fact, Dunchurch was the former staff college for GEC Marconi, for whom he worked in the 1980s.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now confirmed to Newsnight that he did not get any qualifications there either, but that he completed six separate courses lasting a few days each, adding up to about a month in total.    Newsnight has now spoken to 19 former tutors at Dunchurch. Most agree it is over-emphasising his experience at Dunchurch to describe it in the way he does.    John Garside, a former Dunchurch tutor, says: ""I'm puzzled, flattered, but puzzled. What we did was offer short courses... it was not a continuous form of education by any means.""    Newsnight has shown these details to some of Iain Duncan Smith's constituents in Chingford.    Several people assumed he must have been at both the University of Perugia and Dunchurch for several years, and obtained qualifications in either or both places.

269,"In just a decade, one fencing club in Cornwall has gone from just a handful of members to providing for London 2012.  Truro's Louise Bond-Williams and James Honeybone, both British number ones, and leading junior Sophie Williams will represent Team GB in the sabre.  And Truro Fencing Club's rise has been down in part to coach Jon Salfield.  ""Rolling the clock back a few years it would have been inconceivable,"" Salfield told BBC Sport.  Salfield's expertise in the sabre saw him appointed as a coach for Team GB last year.  But with all three British sabre fencers coming from Truro it has  ""It's a difficult situation, of course it is,"" Salfield said.  ""I think it's been handled really professionally by GB Fencing and the BOA.  ""I was not involved in the selection of the sabre athletes whatsoever.  ""Especially with the women, there were four fencers who all had good and bad points.  ""It's not an easy decision and I understand why athletes are unhappy if they have not been picked for the Olympics, but I had no undue influence and it was above board.""  At 21-years-old, Honeybone is the British men's sabre number one and has been fencing at Truro for a decade.  ""When I started at Truro Fencing Club 10 or 11 years ago it was a tiny club with maybe 10 members and now we're one of the superpowers in Britain,"" he told BBC Radio Cornwall.  ""The Olympics is what I've been working towards for a very long time and it's the dream, it's what every athlete wants to do.  ""It's been a very long, nervous wait. No-one really knew what was going on and now it's out in the open and it's amazing.""  Truro put together a high-performance programme three years ago and last year Salfield was named as national coach for the sabre.  ""That put Truro in a really good position to push forward with their development. There are a number of super-powers in sabre and we're now one of them,"" Salfield said.  ""It's a great PR opportunity for the club in Truro and for the whole of sport in Cornwall.  ""It's a high-profile story for the county and the South West and it's a demonstration of the quality of sport Cornwall and Truro can produce."""
270,"Is India sliding into a pseudo monarchy of sorts? In his splendid new book, India: A Portrait, historian Patrick French dredges up some startling data on the stranglehold of family and lineage on Indian politics.     The research finds that though less than a third of India's parliamentarians had a hereditary connection, things get worse with the younger MPs. Consider this:  Interestingly, for MPs over 50, the proportion with a father or relative in politics was a rather modest 17.9%. But when you looked at those aged 50 or under, this increased by more than two and a half times to nearly half, or 47.2%.  Also most of the younger hereditary MPs - and ministers - have not made a mark and sometimes have been shockingly conservative in their actions. A young MP from feudal Haryana, for example, was seen to be cosying up to extra-constitutional village councils in the state which were punishing couples for marrying outside their caste and clan.     ""If the trend continued,"" concludes French, ""it was possible that most members of the Indian Parliament would be there by heredity alone, and the nation would be back to where it had started before the freedom struggle, with rule by a hereditary monarch and assorted Indian princelings."" He also worries the next Lok Sabha will be a ""house of dynasts"".  Most agree that growing nepotistic and lineage-based power in the world's largest democracy is a matter of concern. ""The idea of India,"" political scientist Mahesh Rangarajan told me, ""is rent apart by these two contradictory impulses.""  But nepotism is a part of India life; and politics mirrors society. Power, wealth, land and status have hinged to a large extent on who your parents were, what they owned and where they stood in society. Most Indian businesses continue to be owned and run by families though the new economy is throwing up more first generation entrepreneurs. Bollywood, India's thriving film industry, is dominated by sons and daughters of famous actors and producers. Three members of one family - Nehru-Gandhi - have held the post of prime minister. If the Congress party wins the next elections and PM Manmohan Singh steps down, there is a likelihood of the dynast Rahul Gandhi becoming India's next prime minister. (It is no surprise that 37% of the MPs - 78 of 208 - in Congress are hereditary compared to only 19% hereditary MPs - 22 of the 116 - in the main opposition BJP.)  Despite French's troubling data, all may not be lost. ""Please remember,"" Dr Rangarajan told me, ""the MPs have lineage as a huge plus, but the posts are not hereditary."" In other words, if they fail to deliver, they will be voted out of power. Merit triumphed over dynasty in the recent elections in dirt-poor Bihar. So though lineage remains a key factor in politics, remind analysts, it can only give a headstart, and nothing more. Thank democracy for that."
271,"Scientists at one of the world's most advanced observatories are facing an uncertain future, with a closure threat hanging over its flagship project. Jodrell Bank in Cheshire, home of the landmark Lovell Telescope, is part of a network of seven giant astronomy dishes in the eMerlin project. The Science and Technology Facilities Council is struggling to finance it. A Jodrell Bank spokesman said it opposed any cut backs and would push for eMerlin to keep its funding. The project is at risk because the STFC has an £80m shortfall in its budget; and an assessment panel has listed the project as a ""lower priority"" for UK physics and astronomy. The issue is still in the consultation stages, but closure of the project could leave the University of Manchester-owned Jodrell Bank little more than a study centre. Its scientists have been working on the eMerlin project since 2002, at a cost of more than £2m a year. It is the national facility for radio astronomy and aims to improve links between the dishes to make the radio telescopes 30 times more powerful. The loss of funding in 2009 - the year eMerlin was due to launch - would mean the work could go to waste. Jodrell Bank will put forward representation for the consultation on the STFC plans. The potential impact on astronomy would be huge    Phil Diamond, director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, said: ""No decisions have been made. It's not just us that's under threat, but we are the most visible. ""We were put on the low priority list, and I find that incredible. We are coming to the end of the upgrade, which when it comes on stream we will be one of the most powerful telescopes on the planet, so it is unbelievable. ""The potential impact on astronomy would be huge. ""We are trying to understand how galaxies are formed, how stars are born - these are all fundamental to how life evolved and we have to understand the whole sequence of creation. ""If we withdraw from Merlin and threaten Jodrell Bank, it means that the UK will effectively withdraw from radio astronomy."" A spokesman for the STFC stressed that no decisions had yet been taken but admitted some projects would be affected to fit in with budget constraints. He said: ""Because of the shortfall in our budget we have to come up with a programme that sits within that financial envelope and we have drawn up a list of priorities to achieve that. ""That list will be put to the scientific community for three to four weeks to consult and get their views on it. Nothing is concrete, the process is ongoing and we will be open to responses. ""Saying that funding will be cut from any particular project is premature and speculative."" Working in Jodrell's favour is the leading role it is playing in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project, a giant next-generation radio telescope. The SKA's huge fields of antennas will be sited in Australia or South Africa and sweep the sky for answers to the major outstanding questions in astronomy. But although the infrastructure will be in another country, the headquarters of the SKA will be at Jodrell. The SKA is listed as a high priority in STFC plans.     "
272,"The world's largest mass yellow fever immunisation is starting in West Africa, targeting 12 million people.  Health charities are rolling out the vaccines to people in Benin, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Thirteen African nations are said to be at high risk of outbreaks of yellow fever, which can kill if untreated.  Yellow fever is spread through infected mosquitoes and has a wide array of symptoms from nausea and vomiting to kidney failure, jaundice and bleeding.  About half those who develop severe symptoms and are untreated die from the disease - about 30,000 people each year worldwide.  Local health staff in the target countries will vaccinate nearly 12 million people, as well as giving out vitamin A and de-worming tablets.  The World Health Organization says it is not aiming to eliminate yellow fever - there are too many infected mosquitoes in urban areas to make that possible - but to greatly reduce the number of people getting sick with the disease.  It wants to finish mass vaccinations in all high-risk African countries by 2015, but warns there is currently a gap in the funding needed to take the programme to the remaining West African countries most affected by yellow fever."
273,"China has decided ""in principle"" to build a supply dock on an island it disputes with Vietnam in the South China Sea.  The province of Hainan is looking to build on what is known as Jinqing in China and Duy Mong in Vietnam in the Paracel islands as part of tourism plans, according to a statement.  There have been tensions over both countries' claims to the chain of small islands and reefs.  China has occupied the area since 1974.  According to a statement published on China's State Oceanic Administration website on Thursday, the project will be privately funded after it agreed ""in principle"" to the proposal from Hainan province.  The statement also mentions plans for another supply dock in the South China Sea, but no other details were given.  Tan Li, deputy governor of Hainan province, said earlier this week that tourism trips would be open to the public later in the year.  Tensions have escalated recently between China and Vietnam after Vietnamese fishermen were detained last month by China for fishing around the Paracels. The fishermen where freed on 21 April.  The South China Sea, seen to be rich in oil and natural gas reserves, has been a source of maritime conflict between several countries.  The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims in the area, as well as China and Vietnam."
274,"BT has said it will launch a new service later this year to divert nuisance calls within its network before they ring on customers' phones.  It said it will use huge computing power to root out 25 million unwanted calls a week.  Currently, BT customers can buy special phones that block nuisance calls, or pay to stop calls getting through.  But the new service will identify some of the 5 billion unwanted calls made each year before they arrive.  They will then be diverted automatically to a junk voicemail box.  Customers will be able to add numbers they don't want to hear from, for free.  The hope is that action from BT will turn the tables on nuisance callers. The company is following the lead from Talk Talk, which already bars calls for free and blocks millions centrally.  However, experts warn that this is a battle that is likely to rumble on, because firms hassling people will be able to switch numbers and use pretend numbers to hide who they are.  Many fraudsters and malicious callers targeting individuals will still be able to get through, they say."
275,"Several countries have criticised Canada for formally withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.  A spokesman for France's foreign ministry called the move ""bad news for the fight against climate change"", a sentiment echoed by other officials.  Peter Kent, Canada's minister of the environment, has said the protocol ""does not represent a way forward"".  The move, which is legal and was expected, makes Canada the first nation to pull out of the global treaty.  A spokesman for China's foreign ministry told reporters that the decision was ""regrettable and flies in the face of the efforts of the international community"", Reuters news agency reported.  The protocol, initially adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, is aimed at fighting global warming. Through the agreement, countries like China and India take voluntary, but non-binding steps to reduce their carbon emissions.  Japan's own environment minister, Goshi Hosono, urged Canada to stay in the protocol.  That Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol has been the worst-kept recent secret in climate change politics. On taking office in 2007, Stephen Harper's government found their predecessors, for all their green rhetoric, had done little to cut Canada's emissions. Rather than heading for a 6% cut from 1990 levels by 2020, the Kyoto pledge, it was and still is set for a rise of about 16% - more like 30% if you include forestry. The obvious answer, to huge disdain from critics, was to say they wouldn't try meeting the target. Since then, the approach has been to copy the US line. Canada's current pledge is exactly the same as the US one - a cut of 17% from 2005 levels by 2020 - with the proviso that the number will change if the US passes legislation with a different target. And as the US is outside Kyoto, Canada's last act of mimicry was to leave as well. A burning question at the recent UN talks in Durban was whether Japan, Russia, Australia or New Zealand would follow Canada's lead - which would effectively leave just European countries inside. For the moment, it appears unlikely, as all like the flexibility Kyoto offers for meeting emission targets. But it's not impossible.  But that will not happen, Mr Kent said. ""Kyoto, for Canada, is in the past, and as such we are invoking our legal right to withdraw from Kyoto,"" Mr Kent said.  He said he would be formally advising the United Nations of his country's intention to pull out.  He said meeting Canada's obligations under Kyoto would cost $13.6bn (10.3bn euros; £8.7bn): ""That's $1,600 from every Canadian family - that's the Kyoto cost to Canadians, that was the legacy of an incompetent Liberal government.""  Despite that cost, greenhouse emissions would continue to rise as two of the world's largest polluters - the US and China - were not covered by the Kyoto agreement, Mr Kent said.  ""We believe that a new agreement that will allow us to generate jobs and economic growth represents the way forward.""  Mr Kent's announcement came just hours after a last-minute deal on climate change was agreed in Durban  Talks on a new legal deal covering all countries will begin next year and end by 2015, coming into effect by 2020, the UN climate conference decided.  Some countries, including India, were worried that the first nation to formally remove itself from the binding Kyoto agreement would jeopardise the future conferences.  For low-lying island nation Tuvalu, most at-risk for rising sea levels, the withdrawal was more personal.  ""For a vulnerable country like Tuvalu, its an act of sabotage on our future,"" Ian Fry, Tuvalu's lead negotiator told Reuters. ""Withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol is a reckless and totally irresponsible act.""  ""The Canadian decision to withdraw from the protocol should not be used to suggest Canada does not intend to play its part in global efforts to tackle climate change,"" a spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald.  Mr Kent said that Kyoto was a ""dated document"" but said ""there was good will demonstrated in Durban, the agreement that we ended up with provides the basis for an agreement by 2015"".  Though the text of the Durban agreement ""provides a loophole for China and India"", the Canadian minister said, it represents ""the way forward"".  Canada's previous Liberal government signed the accord but Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government never embraced it.  Canada declared four years ago that it did not intend to meet its existing Kyoto Protocol commitments and its annual emissions have risen by about a third since 1990.  Canada's withdrawal from Kyoto was not unexpected. In early December, Canada's The Globe and Mail looked at the likely costs or penalties of either failing to meet the 2012 Kyoto targets or withdrawing from the protocol. ""The question which remains is whether the effect on Canada's international reputation would be greater as a result of withdrawal or non-compliance,"" Andrew Leach writes.  A CBC analysis argues that the original Kyoto protocol did its job, if only in the narrow sense of reducing the emissions of signatories. However, at the time same emissions levels in other countries grew. Robert Sheppard writes that Canada set naive set targets last time and by failing to live up to them has damaged its position.  ""It's a legitimate argument: China needs to step up."" he says. ""But how do you make it with a straight face when you haven't come anywhere close to meeting your own international obligations and you also want to turn around and sell China as much oil sands petroleum as it is willing to take?""  Globe and Mail opinion columnist Margaret Wente dismisses the Durban talks as ""absurd"" and says climate change conferences are more about power and money and the opportunity for growing economies to ""extract billions"" from rich countries.  Meanwhile, Craig McInnes at the Vancouver Sun sees the Kyoto withdrawal as part of a larger abandonment by the Canadian government on the climate issue, and worries that while his fellow citizens say they care about the environment, they lack the will as consumers and citizens to make significant changes."
276,"Kyrgyzstan's interim government has asked Russia to help end ethnic clashes in the southern city of Osh, in which 77 people have been killed.  ""We need the entry of outside armed forces to calm the situation down,"" interim leader Roza Otunbayeva said.  But Russia said for the time being it would not send troops to Kyrgyzstan.  Thousands of ethnic Uzbeks have massed at the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border as they try to escape fighting between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks that has raged for two days.  One child was crushed to death at the border.  In a televised address, Ms Otunbayeva said she had sent a letter to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev asking him to send military reinforcements.  She described the situation in Osh as ""out of control"".  Russia was not prepared to send troops to Kyrgyzstan under the current circumstances, but would send humanitarian aid to the violence-hit region, a spokeswoman for Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said.  ""It is an internal conflict and for now Russia does not see the conditions for taking part in its resolution,"" Natalya Timakova, Mr Medvedev's spokeswoman, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.  Mr Medvedev would consult with other members of the regional security grouping, the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, about a response to the crisis, Ms Timakova said.  The 150 Russian soldiers based near the Kyrgyz capital had been given no instruction to intervene, Russian media quoted an unnamed senior military source as saying.  A plane carrying medical supplies has been sent to Kyrgyzstan to evacuate some of the badly-injured people for treatment in Russia, officials in Moscow said.  The violence is the worst to hit the Central Asian country since President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was overthrown in April.  Nearly people have been hurt, health ministry officials said, adding that there was a shortage of food and care for the injured.  The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie, who is at the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border, says guards have been letting people through one by one.  The refugees say their houses were burned down and they have nowhere to go.  People at the border say that hundreds of other Uzbeks are stranded in their neighbourhoods in Osh.  They claim that people are being shot at from armoured personnel carriers, which are making way for armed gangs of ethnic Kyrgyz.  Eyewitnesses told the BBC that many people had been shot dead but it was impossible to retrieve the bodies.  ""The situation is very bad. There is no sign of it stopping. Homes have been set ablaze... Entire streets are on fire,"" said Interior Ministry spokesman Rakhmatillo Akhmedov.  Machine-gun fire can be heard as troops try to regain control of the streets, the Associated Press reports.  The interim government has denied security personnel are shooting at people and says its forces are preventing others from entering Osh to join the fighting.  A state of emergency was declared in a second southern city, Jalalabad, as ""the area of ethnic instability is expanding"", an official with the interim government said.  Kyrgyz TV reported that the country's borders with Tajikistan and China have been closed because of the unrest.  According to local reports, the violence broke out between rival gangs and developed into gun battles late on Thursday.  The unrest comes ahead of a referendum on the constitution, scheduled for 27 June.  Ms Otunbayeva has blamed supporters of Mr Bakiyev for inciting the violence to destabilise the country ahead of the referendum.  The leaders of Russia and China - which borders Kyrgyzstan - have appealed for calm.  The political crisis has raised fears of a civil war in the country, where both Russia and the US have military bases.  Washington uses the base about 300km (190 miles) from Osh for US operations in Afghanistan.  Mr Bakiyev fled with his family to Belarus after violent clashes between government forces and protesters on 7 April."
277,"Roald Dahl spent two years at the Cathedral School in Llandaff, from the age of seven to nine. He then moved to St Peter's boarding school in Weston-super-Mare and suffered from homesickness. At the age of 13 he moved on to Repton School in Derbyshire.  Dahl's largely unhappy time at school is chronicled in Boy, the memoir of his childhood, in which he shares stories about his school days and his family."
278,"It’s been called “Paddy’s Wigwam” and all sorts of other names over the years, and it’s an essential part of the Liverpool skyline.  Liverpool’s Catholic Cathedral, properly known as “The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King” stands on Brownlow Hill in Liverpool city centre.  In May 2007 it celebrates two major anniversaries. May 14th is the fortieth anniversary of the consecration of the Cathedral and May 30th is the 25th anniversary of the day Pope John Paul II made his historic visit to the Cathedral and the city.  The name “Metropolitan” marks out the Cathedral as the seat of the Archbishop of Liverpool, the spiritual leader not just of Catholics in Merseyside but all across the Northern Province of the Catholic Church in England comprising seven dioceses in all.  In 1962 a less ambitious but more modern plan was accepted: the design of Frederick Gibberd for a Cathedral which expressed the renewing of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1960’s.  Less than five years later, on the Feast of Pentecost, May 14th 1967, the new Cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Augustine Harris.  The cathedral remains a triumph of modernism and an expression of the new confidence of the Roman Catholic Church, reformulated in liturgy and design for a new age."
279,"Israel has been evacuating its citizens from Kenya after two attacks on Israeli targets in the city of Mombasa which killed at least 15 people.  In an overnight operation that went on into the early hours, four military Hercules planes with teams of doctors and psychologists flew into Mombasa and evacuated injured Israeli tourists and all those who wanted to leave.  Earlier, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to hunt down the perpetrators of the attacks.  ""Our long arm will get those who carried out the terror attacks. No one will be forgiven,"" Mr Sharon said shortly after being re-elected to lead his Likud party into January's general elections.  American and Israeli investigators have arrived in Kenya to help with the investigation.  Twelve civilians - including one Israeli adult and two children - were killed alongside the three suicide attackers at an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombasa.  In a separate attack, two missiles narrowly missed an Israeli holiday jet that had taken off from the city's airport.  Mr Sharon has put the Mossad intelligence agency, which has a reputation for ruthlessness, in charge of investigating the attacks. American investigators are reported to have joined the hunt.  Mossad is best known for hunting down and killing several Palestinians suspected of the kidnap and murder of 11 Israelis at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Kenya has pledged to spare no efforts in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the attacks.  Police said they were questioning two men who were detained in Mombasa after the attacks, but gave no further details.  Security has been stepped up throughout the country since the attacks, especially in coastal areas and national parks frequented by tourists.  US security officials have been sent to protect American citizens on a cruise ship currently docked in Mombasa harbour.  The bombing, at 0800 local time (0500 GMT) on Thursday, reduced a large part of the Paradise Hotel to rubble and the rest to a smouldering shell.  Kenyan police said that as well as the three Israelis, nine Kenyans died, most of whom were said to be traditional dancers who came to welcome the tourists.  Three suicide bombers were also killed, they added.  The blast occurred just after some 60 visitors had checked into the hotel, all of them from Israel, hotel officials said.  In Lebanon, a previously unknown group called the Army of Palestine has said it carried out the attacks.  The group said it wanted the world to hear the ""voice of the refugees"" on the 55th anniversary of the partition of Palestine.  But Kenyan and Israeli officials speculated that Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network might have been responsible.  Washington condemned the attacks, but said it was too early to blame al-Qaeda.  ""Today's attacks underscore the continuing willingness of those opposed to peace to commit horrible crimes,"" President George W Bush said in Crawford, Texas, where he was spending the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  ""The United States remains firmly committed, with its partners around the world, to the fight against terror and those who commit these heinous acts.""  Mr Bush urged all ""those who seek peace... to dismantle the infrastructure of terror"".  If confirmed as the work of al-Qaeda, it would be their first direct attack on Israelis - despite Bin Laden's hostility towards Israel.  Mombasa, on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, is a popular destination for foreign visitors and the hotel was frequented mainly by Israeli tourists.  In 1998, the US embassies in Kenya and neighbouring Tanzania were attacked in nearly simultaneous car bombings that killed 219 people and 12 people respectively. The US blamed al-Qaeda.  Coordinated, synchronised attacks are a hallmark of al-Qaeda, and the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says months of careful surveillance clearly went into the latest Kenya attacks.  In the second attack, missiles were fired at an Arkia airline plane - a Boeing 757 carrying 261 passengers.  The airliner landed safely at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv about five hours later. It was escorted in by Israeli F-15 fighter jets.  Kenyan police said a missile launcher and two missile casings were found in the Changamwe area of Mombasa, about two kilometres from the airport.  The Arkia charter company has a regular weekly service flying tourists between Tel Aviv and Mombasa."
280,"Thousands of people are reported to have been killed and many others injured in a poison gas attack on a Kurdish city in northern Iraq.  Up to 20 aircraft, said to include Iraqi Migs and Mirages, were seen overhead at around 1100 local time in Halabja.  According to experts, the chemicals dropped by the planes may have included mustard gas, the nerve agents sarin, tabun and VX and possibly cyanide.  The attack on Halabja, which is about 150 miles (241km) north-east of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, is the latest in the Iran-Iraq war and follows its occupation by Iranian forces.  Iraq was said to be keen to avenge the fall of Halabja, which is seen as an important centre for Kurdish resistance in their struggle for autonomy.  The assault came after two days of conventional mortars, artillery and rockets from nearby mountains.  According to pro-Iranian Kurdish commanders in Halabja, there were up to 14 aircraft sorties, with seven to eight planes in each group.  The planes were believed to have concentrated their attacks on the city and all the roads leading out of it.  Eyewitnesses have told of clouds of smoke billowing upward ""white, black and then yellow""', rising as a column about 150 feet (46 metres)in the air.  Most of the wounded, who were taken to hospital in the Iranian capital Tehran, were suffering from mustard gas exposure.  Those who escaped death have developed respiratory or visual problems from the cocktail of chemicals dropped on the city.  According to some reports, up to 75% of the victims were women and children.  The injured survivors seen by reporters showed the classic symptoms of mustard gas poisoning - ugly skin lesions and breathing difficulties.  Some residents survived by covering their faces with damp cloths and taking to the mountains around Halabja.  One resident, Abdul Rahman, 60, an employee at the city's mosque, said: ""I do not know where my children are."""
281,"The Labrador Retriever is a breed of dog which originated in Newfoundland, Canada. These dogs can be black, yellow, or chocolate in colour and are popular the world over as household pets. They have short fur which moults twice a year and soft, triangular ears which hang close to their square-cut heads. Watch out for the strong, straight tails, which are just the right height to constantly sweep items off coffee tables.  Centuries ago, Labradors were trained to drag fishing nets from boat to shore and a love of swimming is characteristic of the breed. Their double-layered coat keeps them warm in water , comprising a soft downy undercoat and a harder, water repellent topcoat which helps them shake dry when they climb back onto land . Labradors will retrieve pretty much anything - from land or water - and they have mouths so gentle they can carry an egg without breaking it. All this combined with a good sense of smell has made them a popular choice of gundog, pursuing and retrieving wounded game over practically any terrain. An intelligent and friendly breed, they are often trained as guide dogs for the blind or as professional sniffer dogs.  Most of all, Labradors are loved in millions of households as family pets. Their retrieving skills are used on balls and sticks, and their noses are dedicated to sniffing out the smallest morsel of potential food wherever it is to be found.  All pedigree animals suffer from problems arising from the fact that they are basically inbred. Labradors in particular often have hereditary hip problems.  Obesity is also a common problem among Labradors kept as pets. These dogs are basically highly evolved stomachs on legs - puppies have even been known to eat themselves to death. Too many treats and too little exercise means that, sadly, many Labradors are too fat and suffer as a result."
282,"Police in the Bosnian capital said the blast happened at 0300 (0100 GMT) on Friday, at the domed monument in the Kovaci (Martyrs) Cemetery.  Izetbegovic, who died in October 2003 aged 78, led Bosnia to independence in 1992, angering Bosnian Serbs.  He led the country in the 1992-95 war against Serb and Croat nationalists.  Bosnian public radio said the blast destroyed the marble tombstones, but the dome over the grave remained intact.  Police sealed off the cemetery and launched a major investigation.  About 110,000 people died in the Bosnian war and more than two million fled their homes."
283,"He has survived political correctness and the PlayStation generation. Now Mr Punch is about to celebrate his 350th birthday. What's the reason for his longevity?  With his familiar cry of ""That's the way to do it!"", Mr Punch has come a long way since his first mention in the diary of Samuel Pepys.  Next week, the squawking red-nosed prince of slapstick turns 350, with a big party in London's Covent Garden piazza.  It was here that Pepys recorded, on 9 May 1662, that he enjoyed ""an Italian puppet play that is within the rayles there, which is very pretty, the best that ever I saw...""  In Pepys' day, Mr Punch was a stringed marionette called Pulcinella, but he has evolved over the decades into the stick-wielding hand puppet now so familiar at summer fayres and seaside resorts.  ""Mr Punch is often misunderstood and misrepresented,"" says Glyn Edwards, the master puppeteer who is organising the birthday celebrations. ""He is a lord of misrule, he's not Jack the Ripper with a red nose.""  With a £240,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund , Mr Edwards' performing arts charity PuppetLink Ltd is organising The Big Grin - a nationwide celebration of Punch and Judy's place in popular culture.  The main event in Covent Garden on 12-13 May will be a birthday party attended by Punch and Judy enthusiasts from around the world.  Meanwhile, the V&A Museum of Childhood has commissioned an exhibition of photographic portraits by Tom Hunter of contemporary Punch practitioners - known as ""Professors"" - pictured with their booths.  And Brighton Fishing Museum will open a permanent Punch and Judy display on the site where shows have been given since the 1830s.  So how has Mr Punch managed to make it into the 21st Century?  ""Mr Punch has been seen by every monarch since Charles II,"" says Mr Edwards. ""He's had to keep in tune with the social climate.""  Comedy routines that would have been enjoyed by the Victorians - such as one involving a hangman getting hanged - have disappeared as public tastes have changed.  ""It's a classic piece of gallows humour,"" says Mr Edwards, ""but we don't do it any more because people don't understand it as a topical joke.""  These days Mr Punch is more likely to have youth crime and the financial crisis on his agenda.  ""When Judy refers to the baby as little Asbo it gets a laugh,"" says Mr Edwards, who has also introduced a new character called Mr Bonus the Banker.  He also has a health and safety officer - complete with a clipboard and hi-viz jacket - who ends up in Mr Punch's sausage machine.  While Punch and Judy have faced criticism that they are too violent for children - in 2004 a council in Cornwall banned a show following complaints that it promoted domestic violence - Mr Punch and friends look set to thrive in the new millennium.  ""He's an English icon,"" says Mr Edwards. ""I know from personal experience that there isn't a Punch and Judy act that's not booked over the Jubilee period. At times of national holidays, Mr Punch is regarded as someone who ought to be there.""  The art of live puppetry in general has gained a high profile after the success of stage shows like War Horse and Avenue Q.  ""We all live in Mr Punch's shadow and what a strange shadow it is,"" laughs Mervyn Millar, UK director of Handspring - the puppet company behind War Horse, which is soon to unveil a new show Crow based on the poems of Ted Hughes.  ""As soon as I started working with puppets I made myself a Punch because there's something about his physiognomy and his spirit that is so compelling.  ""It's delightful to see so much anarchic and socially irresponsible energy in a tiny little thing the size of a person's hand.""  He adds: ""It reminds us that puppetry can represent anything. It can be dangerous and exciting and satirical. It also reminds us that children will happily watch all that stuff if you don't tell them that they can't.""  While Punch and Judy professors tend to remain hidden within their booths, other puppeteers have turned that concept inside out.  Canadian Jeff Achtem, whose show Swamp Juice is currently at the Soho Theatre ahead of a UK tour, is a shadow puppeteer who makes a point of being visible to his audience.  The performer, who describes Swamp Juice as ""Dr Seuss meets South Park with a 3D finale"", didn't see his first Mr Punch show until he was in his early 20s.  ""What interested me was that it was theatre in the streets that was challenging authority,"" he says with reference to Mr Punch's regular run-ins with the policeman and the devil.  ""The magic of puppetry is that there's this indescribable phenomenon where the audience suspends disbeliefs and permits the puppets to be alive. The other lovely thing about puppets is that they tend to overact a lot.""  The 350th anniversary of Mr Punch is a reminder of the puppet's ancient roots, says Glyn Edwards.  ""Mr Punch isn't just a Victorian construct. There are ancient sources that have been dragged into Punch and Judy.  ""The idea of having a devil in the show is as old as English drama itself. The whole thing is a complicated kaleidoscope of influences.""  As he makes final preparations for next week's birthday party, Mr Edwards admits that his favourite definition of Punch and Judy came from a bemused audience member.  The woman, having had the show explained to her by a Punch and Judy man, summed it up thus: ""Oh, so it's English nonsense descended from Italian nonsense!""  The Big Grin 350th birthday events take place 12-13 May in Covent Garden Piazza, London. The Happy Birthday, Mr Punch exhibition at the V&A Museum of Childhood runs 14 July - 9 December. Other events around the country are listed on The Big Grin website."
284,"Although most of the Bloody Sunday Tribunal evidence was heard in Londonderry, the soldiers who were there on 30 January 1972 appeared in London amid security concerns.  Soldiers who were on the ground at the time of the shootings gave evidence anonymously. They were not granted immunity from prosecution; only immunity from self-incrimination.  Colonel Wilford was directly in charge of the soldiers who went into the Bogside to arrest rioters. It was his job to run a successful operation to round up trouble-makers, protect the public and get his troops back to base unharmed.  But Saville concludes that the soldiers only went into the Bogside because the colonel went further than his orders from Brigadier MacLellan. His superior wanted to avoid running battles that would make it impossible to distinguish between rioters and peaceful marchers.  ""Colonel Wilford either deliberately disobeyed Brigadier MacLellan's order or failed for no good reason to appreciate the clear limits of what he had been authorised to do,"" said Saville.  ""Colonel Wilford decided to send Support Company into the Bogside because at the time he gave the order he had concluded (without informing Brigadier MacLellan) that there was now no prospect of making any, or any significant, arrests in the area he had originally suggested, as the rioting was dying down and people were moving away.  ""In addition it appears to us that he wanted to demonstrate that the way to deal with rioters in Londonderry was not for soldiers to shelter behind barricades like (as he put it) ""Aunt Sallies"" while being stoned, as he perceived the local troops had been doing, but instead to go aggressively after rioters, as he and his soldiers had been doing in Belfast.  ""What Colonel Wilford failed to appreciate, or regarded as of little consequence, was that his soldiers… would almost certainly be unable to identify anyone as a rioter.""  Col Wilford was exonerated by the Widgery tribunal and six months after the event he was awarded the Order of the British Empire by the Queen.  The Saville inquiry found that one soldier, Lance Corporal F killed Patrick Doherty, Michael Kelly, Bernard McGuigan and possibly also William McKinney and James Wray.  The report says: ""Lance Corporal F did not fire in a state of fear or panic. We are sure that he fired either in the belief that no-one in the area into which he fired was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or not caring whether or not anyone there was posing such a threat.""  Other soldiers who definitely killed were R, G, U. In other cases it is too difficult to work out who exactly was responsible.  ""With the exception of Private T [and another soldier in one specific incident], none of the firing by the soldiers of Support Company was aimed at people posing a threat of causing death or serious injury.""  ""We have concluded, for the reasons we give, that apart from Private T many of these soldiers have knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing.""  In early 1972, the general was commander of land forces and increasingly concerned that the army had no control over a large part of Derry. He wanted to see rioters dealt with swifty.  The inquiry learnt of the existence of a memo, written by Sir Robert in January 1972, in which he suggested shooting (but not killing) some of the ringleaders of the rioting, known as the ""Derry Young Hooligans"". In the general's mind the army was ""virtually incapable"" against these gangs, because they operated under the cover of snipers.  Lord Saville's report said the panel were ""surprised"" that the general should have seriously considered such a plan and did not believe it had been adopted.  But the inquiry said he could not be criticised for deploying soldiers to arrest rioters, although he had probably sent the wrong unit.  ""In our view his decision to use 1 PARA as the arrest force is open to criticism, on the ground that 1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists in Londonderry.  ""However, there is to our minds a significant difference between the risk of soldiers using excessive physical violence when dispersing crowds or trying to arrest rioters and the risk that they would use lethal weapons without justification.""  The inquiry concluded the general had no reason to expect the tragedy that then unfolded. It accepted his denial in evidence that he sent 1 Para in to provoke republican gunmen to confront them in the street.  Brigadier MacLellan had the power to launch arrest operations against rioters during the day - and the inquiry accepted that he delayed launching that plan until he believed there was sufficient separation between their targets and the marchers.  Saville concluded he had no reason to believe that lives were at stake if the team led by Colonel Wilford went in. The inquiry said that his proposed arrest operation did not include storming the Bogside.  ""We have concluded that Brigadier MacLellan does not bear any responsibility for the deaths and injuries from the unjustifiable firing by soldiers on Bloody Sunday.""  Saville exonerates Major Ted Loden, the commander in charge of soldiers following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Families said the major could have stopped the soldiers from firing.  The report says that events moved so fast ""after the soldiers disembarked in the Bogside that Major Loden had no idea what was actually going on; he assumed that his soldiers had come under attack from republican paramilitaries and were responding.  ""At the time the casualties were being sustained, Major Loden neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat.""  General Sir Mike Jackson, the former head of the British Army, was a Parachute Regiment captain on the day and the second in command of 1 Para.  In the aftermath of the shootings, he wrote up what became known as the ""Loden List of Engagements"".  This was a brief account of what soldiers had told Major Loden about why they had fired. Sir Mike told the inquiry that the list was simply an operational record of shots fired - not an investigative document. He had simply transcribed what he had been told.  Families said that the document was an attempt to conceal the truth by presenting each victim as a bomber or gunman. The list was referred to by senior officers in press briefings in the hours after the killings.  Saville said that the circumstances under which the list was compiled were ""far from ideal"".  But the report added: ""We accept Captain Jackson's evidence of the purpose for which the list was initially prepared; and find nothing sinister in the fact that it did not include details such as the names of the soldiers and the number of rounds fired.  ""However, the list did play a role in the Army's explanations of what occurred on the day."""
285,"The 20 Premier League clubs have agreed, in principle, to introduce radical new cost controls.  There are two main proposals on the table - a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bills by each season.  Club chief executives have now been asked to produce detailed plans for exactly how these proposals will work.  These rules would mark a major change for the clubs, which made cumulative losses of £361m in 2010-11.  Champions Manchester City, for example, made a £97.9m loss in their latest set of results, which were revealed last Friday.  City and Fulham are the only clubs opposed to any spending controls, BBC Sport understands. However, any new Premier League rule requires the approval of only 14 of the 20 clubs in order to be introduced.  With the Premier League's new three-year television deals expected to break through the £5bn barrier from 2013, momentum is growing to find a way of preventing the majority of that cash going straight to players and agents.  There have now been six meetings of top-flight chairmen where cost controls have been discussed without any concrete decisions being made.  The next meeting will be on 6 February."
286,"In few other countries did the Roman Catholic Church play such a prominent role in the struggle for nationhood as in East Timor.  The government has declared three days of national mourning to mark the death of Pope John Paul II.  His visit to East Timor in 1989 was a catalyst which encouraged those fighting for independence to seek greater international support.  During the 24 years of Indonesian occupation nuns and priests, led by Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, risked their lives to try to protect the mainly Roman Catholic population from military abuses.  Bishop Belo's outspoken condemnation of human rights abuses in the territory earned him a shared Nobel Peace Prize in 1996.  In 1989 East Timor had been hidden from view for 14 years, completely sealed off by an Indonesian occupation which had reportedly cost the lives of one-third of its population.  A planned visit by the Pope that year was controversial.  The Vatican prized its cordial relations with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, but with a sizable minority of Roman Catholics.  Indonesia would not tolerate any suggestion that its rule in East Timor was not legitimate.  It insisted Pope John Paul II hold mass in a natural arena under the mountains outside Dili where a number of atrocities were thought to have taken place.  But the evidence of extensive human rights abuses, and the anguished protests of Bishop Belo, demanded some show of solidarity from the Pope.  On arriving in Dili he kissed a cross, with which he then touched the ground, rather than kissing the ground itself as was his custom, to avoid suggesting East Timor was a sovereign country.  He spoke out strongly against all abuses, without specifying his Indonesian hosts, but making it clear enough to the tens of thousands who had come to hear him whom he had in mind.  In front of the world's cameras for the first time, young Timorese scuffled and then fought with the Indonesian security forces, the outside world's first view of a civil disobedience movement which would continue until the referendum which eventually won East Timor its independence in 1999.  At key moments the Vatican backed its priests and bishops, while always professing neutrality on the issue of independence.  Bishop Belo was in many ways like the Pope: politically and morally conservative, but outraged by the cruelty and repression he witnessed.  His outbursts got him into trouble with the Indonesian government, which put pressure on the Vatican to replace him.  The Vatican refused. I can vividly remember the extraordinary day in 1996 when the Indonesian ruler Suharto made his first visit to East Timor in eight years.  He had to meet Bishop Belo, who through unlucky timing for Indonesia had just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  But the Vatican Ambassador to Jakarta ushered him out to meet us, and stood smiling behind him, as Bishop Belo said how strange it was that he was the first Indonesian citizen to win the Nobel Prize.  Yet the president had not even mentioned it, let alone congratulated him.  The church in East Timor was after all an extraordinary success story for the Vatican - at the time of the Indonesian invasion only 20% of its people called themselves Roman Catholics, a faith they associated with Portuguese colonial rule.  Ten years later that figure had risen to 95%.  With nowhere else to turn to, people sought refuge in the church.  Some of the clergy directly helped the armed resistance movement in the mountains.  Pope John Paul II would have been uncomfortable with this overtly political role, but he did nothing to stop it.  A number of priests and nuns paid with their lives when pro-Indonesian militias rampaged through East Timor after the referendum, but as a result the standing of the church at independence had never been higher.  Ironically now that the struggle is over, church attendance is dwindling, as younger Timorese lose interest and the church's protective role is no longer needed."
287,"Bolivia is preparing for a number of elections in December    The Bolivian government has begun implementing provisions outlined in the new constitution that give indigenous people the chance to govern themselves. President Evo Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous leader, enacted a decree setting out the conditions for Indian communities to hold votes on autonomy. These referendums will take place in December, alongside presidential and parliamentary elections. The new charter was bitterly opposed by Bolivia's traditional elite. On Sunday, the provisions allowing for votes on indigenous autonomy were presented in a special event in the eastern region of Santa Cruz. Mr Morales said it was ""a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement"". Re-election: Allows Mr Morales to stand for re-election in Dec 2009 Indigenous rights: Stresses importance of ethnicity in Bolivia's make-up. A whole chapter devoted to indigenous rights Autonomy: Power decentralised, four levels of autonomy - departmental, regional, municipal and indigenous Resources: Sets out state control over key economic sectors, state sovereignty over vast natural gas fields Judiciary: Indigenous systems of justice same status as official existing system. Judges will be elected, and no longer appointed by Congress. Land: New limit on ownership 5,000 hectares (12,355). But measure not retroactive. ""Your president, your companion, your brother Evo Morales might make mistakes but will never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people,"" he said. Mr Morales has championed Bolivia's indigenous people, who for centuries were banished to the margins of society and did not enjoy full voting rights until 1952. But many opposed to Mr Morales and the new constitution believe he is polarising the country by dividing it along along racial lines. Many Bolivians of European or mixed-race descent in the fertile eastern lowlands, which hold rich gas deposits and are home to extensive farms, rejected the constitution. The new charter came into force in February after being approved by 61% of the electorate. It enshrines state control over key economic sectors, and grants greater autonomy not only for the nine departments but also for indigenous communities. But the clauses regarding layers of autonomy could lead to a raft of competing claims, correspondents say.     "
288,"US President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to cut government costs by cancelling the order for new planes to carry the American president.  Mr Trump tweeted: ""Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!""  The government has a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes.  The White House appeared to cast doubt on the figures quoted by Mr Trump.  ""Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.  The new planes would enter service around 2024.  Boeing shares fell more than 1% after the president-elect's tweet, but recovered most of their losses in afternoon trading.  Mr Trump would not fly on the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election.  The president-elect also announced on Tuesday that Japan's SoftBank has agreed to invest $50bn (£39.4bn) in the US aimed at creating 50,000 new jobs.  Mr Trump revealed the plan after meeting SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower.  ""Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"" he tweeted.  As president and commander-in-chief, Donald Trump will have the power to cancel the contract with Boeing for the new planes.  But if he does, it could cost the US taxpayer even more as the new president tries to save money. The US government has already signed a contract with Boeing for $170m (£134m; €158m). Additional funding has also been earmarked for the two new planes.  The Government Accountability Office - an independent government auditor - estimates the final cost will be $3.2bn. The planes are still in early design phases, though - much of the money has yet to be spent and has not had a chance to overrun the cost estimates.  Negotiation between Boeing and the US government could cut some of the costs, but if Mr Trump pulls out of the Boeing contract entirely the country may lose the money it is already contracted to pay.  Mr Trump now uses his own plane, but as president he would travel aboard Air Force One, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment.  He is known for his admiration of his Trump-branded Boeing 757 jet, boasting to Rolling Stone last year that his aircraft was ""bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way"".  ""Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?"" he said at the time.  The president-elect told reporters on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York that Boeing was ""doing a little bit of a number"" and the cost was ""ridiculous"".  ""We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,"" he added.  Mr Trump's remarks came after the Chicago Tribune published a column early on Tuesday in which Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg suggested the president-elect roll back his anti-trade rhetoric.  ""If we do not lead when it comes to writing these [trade] rules, our competitors will write them for us,"" Mr Muilenburg told the newspaper.  The Government Accountability Office estimates that the project's overall cost will be $3.2bn, a figure that is expected to rise.  The US Air Force said it had budgeted $2.7bn for the project, ""but expects this number to change"".  Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher, in a statement, said: ""We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States.  ""We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer."""
289,"The legislation was passed by the parliament's upper house, having cleared the lower house last month.  The move marks a victory for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has made revising the constitution one of his top priorities, correspondents say.  The current constitution has not been changed since 1947.  Drawn up by the US occupation authorities after WWII, it bans military force in settling international disputes and prohibits maintaining a military for warfare.  But Mr Abe wants Japan to be more assertive on the world stage, with a military able to take part in peacekeeping missions abroad.  Mr Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is working on a draft of a new constitution.  The legislation passed by parliament says that a referendum on the issue cannot take place before 2010, and needs approval from a majority of voters.  ""Since this will take effect in three years, what is important is to deepen the debate among the people even further,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said.  Public opinion in Japan on the issue also appears to be mixed, with many in favour of some changes to the constitution while wanting the country to remain officially pacifist.  Four opposition groups - including the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) - opposed the bill because of divided public sentiment on the issue, Japan's Kyodo news agency said.  Critics of the proposed changes say the pacifist constitution has kept Japan out of war since the 1940s and allowed the country to focus on economic growth instead.  The move may also meet concern from South Korea and China, which remain suspicious of Japan because of its wartime aggressions.  Japan's constitution has been stretched in recent years to allow the country to have a self-defence force.  Under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, this was pushed still further, to allow troops to join peacekeeping missions in Iraq."
290,"Europe's Industry Commissioner Gunter Verheugen said: ""There is not now and never will be any requirement to drop imperial measurements.""  The decision will not affect current law on metric measurements, but means imperial equivalents can be used too.  It follows years of wrangling between London and Brussels over metrication.  The commission has kept extending the deadline for the UK to complete the full transition to the metric system, with the most recent deadline being 2010.  This would have meant setting a deadline for ending the traditional delivery of pints of milk - and the sale of pints of beer in the UK's pubs.  Every one of the UK's road signs would have had to be changed from miles to kilometres - a move which opponents warned would be both expensive and confusing.  But it was the move, begun in 2000, to make the UK's market traders sell their produce in kilograms rather than pounds and ounces which caused outrage among traditionalists.  Sunderland grocer Steve Thoburn inspired the ""metric martyr"" movement with his defiance of the order to abandon the imperial measurements.  In 2001, he was convicted for having weighing scales which had only imperial measurements.  He died unexpectedly from a heart attack three years ago and, while the campaign he founded failed to win traders the right to ignore metric weights altogether, it has brought some results  Under the plans which have now been scrapped, even displaying the price of fruit and vegetables in pounds and ounces would have become grounds for a criminal prosecution.  Mr Verheugen's role includes trying to improve the EU's reputation in member states - and in an interview with the BBC, he admitted the EU had been making itself unpopular on an issue that did not really matter.  ""I organised a huge consultation, and the result was that industry told us there was no problem with the existing system.  ""I want to bring to an end a bitter, bitter battle that has lasted for decades and which in my view is completely pointless. We're bringing this battle to an end.""  However, campaigners on both sides of the debate have played down the significance of the announcement.  John Gardner, director of the pro-imperial British Weights and Measures Association, said: ""I've seen the European Commission statement and what they're saying is it will be allowed to use imperial measurements as additional information.  ""We think that the European Commission statement is extremely misleading. From our point of view the situation hasn't changed and the campaign goes on.  ""If a trader tries to conduct his business in just imperial measurements that will be illegal.""  The UK Metric Association said the statement does not mean that traders can go back to weighing and pricing in imperial measures, and it will be ""business as usual"".  Chairman Robin Paice said: ""While we regret this proposal to prolong the current muddle of metric and imperial units, it will only delay but not stop the inevitable move toward all-metric shopping.  ""Many of the big supermarkets have already stopped giving obsolete imperial prices, and we expect this trend to continue. There is no question of going backwards.""  Science and Innovation Minister Ian Pearson said he welcomed the commission's proposal.  ""This shows that the commission has listened to our views and recognised the strong arguments that we've made for maintaining dual metric and imperial labelling and the right for the UK to decide on the future use of pints and miles,"" he said.  ""We know how important this is to the British people and are grateful for the commission's support for this use to continue.""  The UK first mooted plans to convert to an all-metric system in 1965.  That led to generations of schoolchildren being promised that they would be the last ones who would have to learn two different systems."
291,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A priest who attacked Pope John Paul II in 1982 reached the pontiff with a bayonet and drew blood, it has emerged. The extent of the injury from the attack in Portugal was kept quiet, a film based on an aide's memoirs says. The ultra-conservative Spanish priest, Juan Maria Fernandez y Krohn, was convicted and jailed in Portugal. His attack came a year after the Pope was wounded by Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca in St Peter's Square in Rome. The Pope died in 2005, aged 84. I can now reveal that the Holy Father was wounded. When we got back to the room [in the Fatima sanctuary complex] there was blood    The latest revelation was made in a new documentary film based on the memoirs of the Pope's personal secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz. He said that during the Pope's visit to a shrine in Fatima in Portugal, the priest came at the pontiff with a bayonet. According to Cardinal Dziwisz, the priest managed to draw blood with the weapon but was overcome by the Pope's security guards. ""I can now reveal that the Holy Father was wounded. When we got back to the room [in the Fatima sanctuary complex] there was blood,"" he says in the documentary. Krohn was sentenced to six and a half years for the attack The Pope did not reveal the injury at the time and continued with the trip. There has been no comment from the Vatican on the cardinal's revelations. The documentary film, Testimony, pulls together material from the Pope's private life as related by Cardinal Dziwisz. He is now the cardinal of Krakow in Poland and served as John Paul's private secretary for nearly 40 years, including all his 27 years as Pope. The 90-minute film marks the first time the Vatican has opened its doors to foreign cameras. Pope Benedict XVI will watch a preview later on Thursday.     "
292,"Sir Jimmy Young has used his first newspaper column since his Radio 2 show came to an end to attack the BBC for its instances of ""brutality"".  Sir Jimmy, 81, presented his final lunchtime show on Radio 2 last month after half a century in broadcasting.  His anger at having to leave the station, his home since 1973, was evident as he told listeners it was not his idea to go.  In his new Sunday Express column, Sir Jimmy expanded on the bitterness he felt towards his former employer for making him leave his 12 to 2pm spot.  Sir Jimmy insisted he had ""no axe to grind"" but accused the BBC of having a ""frightening"" and ""brutal"" history.  He added: ""I was going to write that I had enjoyed that relationship (with the BBC) but that wouldn't be true.  ""Sometimes enjoyable, often not, would be a more accurate description.""  Sir Jimmy thanked his listeners for their messages ""ranging from dismay to outrage, at the BBC's decision to axe my enormously successful, award-winning programme"".  In his column, Sir Jimmy also recalled ""one of the BBC's many instances of brutality"".  He described how, 1949, a producer allegedly cut short the career of an unnamed pop group because of an argument with their manager.  He also used his column to attack the BBC over the licence fee.  In 2002, Sir Jimmy had agreed to leave his 12 to 2pm show to do a weekend programme.  He then changed his mind and decided to retire from the BBC altogether.  In response to Sir Jimmy's renewed criticisms, a BBC spokeswoman said: ""We are sorry that Sir Jimmy decided not to continue working for us.""  She added: ""Obviously he is entitled to his own viewpoint.""  Former Newsnight stand-in Jeremy Vine will take over from Sir Jimmy on Radio 2 on 6 January."
293,"An endorsement by astronomers meeting in Prague would require school and university textbooks to be rewritten.  The proposal recognises eight classical planets, three planets belonging to a new category called ""plutons"" and the largest asteroid Ceres.  Pluto remains a planet, but becomes the basis for the new pluton category.  The plan has been drawn up by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) with the aim of settling the question of what does and does not count as a planet.  Some 2,500 astronomers gathered at the IAU General Assembly in Prague will vote on the plan next Thursday.  ""For the first time in more than 75 years, we will be able to discover new planets in our Solar System. This is a fascinating prospect,"" said Richard Binzel, a member of the IAU planet definition committee which put together the proposal.  But the solution was not popular with all experts. Robin Catchpole, from the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, told the BBC: ""The public are very clear about what they understand by 'planets'. Those are the big, dominant bodies in the Solar System that we're all familiar with, the eight - or nine if you include Pluto.  ""I think including more is going to add confusion to the public, but not really be particularly useful for astronomers.""  Experts have been divided over whether Pluto - further away and considerably smaller than the eight other planets in our Solar System - deserves the title.  Since the early 1990s, astronomers have found several other objects of comparable size to Pluto in an outer region of the Solar System called the Kuiper Belt.  Some astronomers believe Pluto belongs with this population of small, icy ""Trans-Neptunians"", not with the objects we call planets.  That changed with the discovery of 2003 UB313 by Professor Mike Brown and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). After being measured with the Hubble Space Telescope, it was shown to be some 3,000km (1,864 miles) in diameter, making it larger than the ninth planet.  The IAU draft resolution recognises eight ""classical"" planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - three ""plutons"" - Pluto, Charon and UB313 - and the asteroid Ceres.  Charon is currently described as a moon of Pluto, but because of its size some experts consider it a twin planet.  Dr Andrew Coates of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Dorking said: ""Something had to be done about the definition. It does change the textbooks somewhat, but it also demonstrates that this is a vibrant area of research.  ""The surprise is Ceres, because most people thought of it as an asteroid.""  Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and like a planet is spherical in shape.  ""This a step backward,"" said Alan Boss, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC. ""It's a demotion of the word planet.""  The Carnegie researcher, who believes there are only eight true planets, said the term would lose its prestige under the proposed definition because anything round of a certain size could join the club.  ""Folks aren't going to have to worry about learning the planets anymore because it's a list that doesn't mean anything,"" he said.  The basis for this re-evaluation is a new scientific definition of a planet which uses gravity as the determining factor.  According to this definition, two conditions must be satisfied for an object to qualify as a planet:  On whether he was confident the resolution would be passed, Professor Gingerich told the BBC News website: ""It will be a very awkward situation if they don't.  ""I'm sure it will be controversial to those with a stake in some other solution, but I hope we will get an overwhelming endorsement.""  More objects are likely to be announced as planets in the future. The IAU has a ""watchlist"" of at least a dozen other potential candidates that could become planets once more is known about their sizes and orbits.  These include the distant objects Sedna, Orcus, Quaoar and 2003 EL61 and the asteroids Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea.  The IAU spent two years debating the matter among its membership. A seven-member committee was set up to consider the findings and produce a draft proposal.  The body has been responsible for the naming of planets and moons since 1919."
294,"The search for a route from the Atlantic around the top of North America and into the Pacific consumed explorers for centuries. Now a growing band of sailing adventurers are traversing the waterway in record times.  This summer, the agency says the passage has been seen to be fully navigable for the first time since satellite records began. Indeed, 2007 was an active year for sailors in the region, according to Peter Semotiuk, who helps mariners navigate their small craft along the route.  Every evening in the summer months, the ham-radio operator provides detailed weather and ice reports, tracks each boat's position and passes on news from other sailors to each of the boats out in the wilderness.  Mr Semotiuk has operated his single-band sailor's radio network for the past two decades from his hometown of Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada, a port in the middle of the Northwest Passage.  One recent summer, he helped co-ordinate a rescue mission for four boats that had become stuck in the ice.  In contrast to this year's lack of ice, he described 2005 as a ""tough"" year. Eight boats tried to get through, but only two succeeded and only with help from ice-breakers.  Mr Semotiuk, who has now signed off for the winter, told the BBC News website that a third boat this season - a lightweight catamaran crewed by a French and Belgian team - had just successfully navigated the full length of the 5,150km (3,200-mile) waterway.  This is the first time the journey has been completed entirely by sail, says Mr Semotiuk. Not so long ago, he says this journey would have been impossible because of the ice.  There has been a marked shrinkage in ice cover in the region in recent years, but this year it was extreme, according to Europe's space agency.  Mr Semotiuk, who completed the journey himself in 1988, said: ""This summer the passage was largely wide open.  ""It's a very different picture to say 20 years ago, when I travelled the length of the passage.  ""The owner of the boat I was travelling on had been trying to get through for five years. On the sixth year, we were successful, although we had to wait for two weeks in the central Arctic for the ice to break.""  Then, Mr Semotiuk would have been making a journey that only the most intrepid traveller would have dared to undertake.  Other ships that had tried earlier than this had been forced to abandon the quest, had disappeared or had been ""crushed like a nut on the shoals and buried in the ice"", as one 20th-century Canadian captain put it.  But since then, about 110 boats had successfully completed the trip, said Mr Semotiuk. Thirty of those were recreational boats, most of which completed the journey in the past decade.  And, where once the journey could have taken years, with sailors being forced to overwinter in ports along the passage due to the ice conditions, this year it was possible to complete the journey in record time.  Roger Swanson, a 76-year-old pig farmer turned yachtsman from Minnesota, completed the journey last week after just 45 days.  Speaking to journalists, he described the journey as smooth sailing.  ""There was hardly any ice,"" Mr Swanson told the Wall Street Journal.  This was all very different to his previous attempt in 2005, when he was forced to turn around, vowing never to return.  A father-and-son British team also completed the journey this year.  ""He's correct to the point that there really wasn't any challenge, so to speak, other than the cold.""  Mr Semotiuk expects a greater number of sailors to turn up next season.  ""But that's not to say the risks are not there,"" he said. ""We could see more icebergs in the eastern Arctic as more glaciers melt off Greenland and off the Canadian east coast.""  The Northwest Passage was the goal of Arctic explorers from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Efforts to discover a trade route through or around North America began in the 1490s with the voyages of John Cabot.  Along the route, there are salutary reminders of those who lost their lives searching for what has been described as the holy grail of mariners.  A number of graves belonging to crew from an ill-fated expedition headed by Sir John Franklin, who sailed from England in the spring of 1845, are a reminder of the region's inhospitable past.  Franklin's two ships, the Erebus and Terror, and 129 men disappeared. The fate of the crewmen is a mystery that remains unsolved.  The commercial implications for the waterway could now be great.  ""But, for all this"", says Mr Semotiuk wistfully, ""I hope the fabled Northwest Passage doesn't become spoilt."""
295,"Nigerian troops completed their withdrawal and transferred control of the northern part of the territory.  The rest of the peninsula will remain under Nigerian civil administration for the next two years, in line with an International Court of Justice ruling.  But the mainly Nigerian population is deeply unhappy about the handover.  The ceremony in the Bakassi fishing town of Archibong came four years after the International Court ruling.  Officials from both countries witnessed the Nigerian military lowering its flag and the Cameroon flag was then raised.  The decision was aimed at settling the territorial dispute, which had led to a series of bloody clashes between Nigeria and Cameroon in the 1990s.  Bakassi juts into the Gulf of Guinea, an area which may contain up to 10% of the world's oil and gas reserves. It is also rich in fish.  But the court ruling has not gone down well with Nigerians living in the peninsula, the BBC's Alex Last reports from nearby Calabar.  Most Archibong residents have said they would rather leave their ancestral land than be ruled by Cameroon, such is their level of mistrust.  Nigerian inhabitants have been given the option of staying under Cameroonian authority or being resettled in Nigeria.  But, despite the Nigerian government's promises, no accommodation has been set up for those wanting to leave.  A few Bakassi young men have said they will stay and fight any attempt by Cameroon to administer the place.  They have requested help from militants along the coast in the Niger Delta, but it is unclear if any help is forthcoming.  Nigeria began withdrawing some 3,000 troops from the Bakassi peninsula on 1 August, years after they were sent in following complaints from Nigerian residents of harassment by Cameroonian police.  The two countries nearly went to war over the territory in 1981 and bloody clashes claimed 34 lives in 1994.  That year, Cameroon took Nigeria to the International Court in The Hague, which after years of legal wrangling ruled in favour of Yaounde in 2002.  Nigeria rejected the ruling, but the UN intervened and the two countries set up a UN-chaired joint commission to resolve the conflict.  The peninsula has been administered by Nigeria since independence from Britain in 1960.  However, Cameroon based its claim of sovereignty over the region on maps dating back to the colonial era"
296,"The US is known for its tough criminal justice system, with an incarceration rate far larger than any comparable country. So why is it that Republicans in Texas are actively seeking to close prisons, asks Danny Kruger, a former speechwriter for David Cameron.  Coming from London to spend a couple of days in Texas last month, I was struck most of all by how generous and straightforward everyone was.  Talking to all sorts of different people about crime and punishment, the same impression came across: We expect people to do the right thing and support them when they do. When they don't we punish them, but then we welcome them back and expect good behaviour again. It's not naive, it's just clear.  For years that straightforward moral outlook translated into a tough criminal justice system. As in the rest of the US, the economic dislocations of the 1970s, compounded by the crack epidemic in the 1980s, led to a series of laws and penal policies which saw the prison population skyrocket.  Texas, for instance, has half the population of the UK but twice its number of prisoners.  Then something happened in 2007, when Texas Republican Congressman Jerry Madden was appointed chairman of the House Corrections Committee with the now famous words by his party leader: ""Don't build new prisons. They cost too much.""  The impulse to what has become the Right on Crime initiative was fiscal conservatism - the strong sense that the taxpayer was paying way too much money to fight a losing war against drugs, mental ill-health and petty criminality.  What Madden found was that too many low-level offenders were spending too long in prison, and not reforming. On the contrary, they were getting worse inside and not getting the help they needed on release.  The only response until then, from Democrat as well as Republican legislators, was to build more prisons. Indeed, Mr Madden's analysis suggested that a further 17,000 prisoners were coming down the pipe towards them, requiring an extra $500m (£320m) for new prisons. But he and his party didn't want to spend more money building new prisons. So they thought of something else - rehab.  Consistent with the straightforward Texan manner, the Congressional Republicans did not attempt to tackle what in Britain are known as ""the causes of crime"" - the socio-economic factors that make people more disposed to offend. Instead, they focused on the individual criminal, and his or her personal choices. Here, they believe, moral clarity and generosity are what's needed.  Though fiscal conservatism may have got the ball rolling, what I saw in Texas - spending time in court and speaking to offenders, prison guards, non-profit staff and volunteers - goes way beyond the desire to save money.  The Prison Entrepreneurship Programme, for instance, matches prisoners with businesspeople and settles them in a residential community on release. Its guiding values are Christian and its staff's motives seem to be love and hope for their ""brothers"", who in turn support the next batch of prisoners leaving jail.  The statutory system is not unloving either. Judge Robert Francis's drugs court in Dallas is a well-funded welfare programme all of its own - though it is unlike any welfare programme most of the 250 ex-offenders who attend it have ever seen.  Clean and tidy, it is staffed by around 30 professionals who are intensely committed to seeing their clients stay clean and out of jail, even if that means sending them back to prison for short periods, as Judge Francis regularly does when required.  Every week the ex-offenders attend court and take a drugs test. Then, in the presence of 50 of their peers, they tell the judge what they've been up to before receiving a round of applause from the crowd.  Immediate, comprehensible and proportionate sanctions are given for bad behaviour, plus accountability to a kind leader and supportive community. This is the magic sauce of Right on Crime.  Far from having to build new jails for the 17,000 expected new inmates, Jerry Madden and his colleagues have succeeded in closing three prisons.  I visited one by the Trinity River in Dallas, now ready for sale and redevelopment. They spent less than half the $500 million earmarked for prison building on rehab initiatives and crime is falling faster than elsewhere.  This, then, ticks all the boxes - it cuts crime, saves money and demonstrates love and compassion towards some of the most excluded members of society. It is, in a sense, what conservatives in America and Britain dream of - a realistic vision of a smaller state, where individuals are accountable for their actions and communities take responsibility for themselves and their neighbours.  It is a more positive version of the anti-politics - anti-Washington, anti-Westminster - tide that seems to be sweeping the West.  I hope that Right on Crime will catch on in Britain. Already there are positive steps towards establishing drugs courts, expanding rehab and opening up our prisons to the community groups which can make such a difference.  This is part of a major reform of outsourcing - some call it privatisation - of prisons and probation, which involves handing huge contracts to private companies who will, it is hoped, subcontract to the little guys.  The danger is that people distrust big corporations as much as they distrust central government. The ideal is a criminal justice system that is genuinely community-led - not directed by profit or by politics, but by local people and the professionals accountable to them.  Danny Kruger is a former speechwriter for David Cameron and now runs Only Connect, a charity for young people involved in, or at risk of, crime.  Republican Rehab broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 1 December at 20:00 GMT - or catch up online."

You were there from the very beginning, but you weren't always the host. Is that right?     At the very beginning, I did the pilot because in those days, anybody that did any broadcasting - and I'd done a bit about music, about jazz, and things - anybody who did any broadcasting and sounded articulate would eventually be called on to do some kind of a pilot, you know. And that sample programme one hoped would go on the air. They never did, 90 percent of them went down the plug after they'd been done because the producers had a budget every year and if they didn't do enough of them, they would cut their budgets. And they used to do them. I thought this was one of them and you pick up a studio fee. No chance it would be coming out. So, I went in and did the first one. They tried to do it all ad-lib which meant that I sat there in the middle of four people, sweating profusely, because on radio with no studio time to go back and re-do an ad-lib situation, it's very nerve wracking.    But you'd not been known in radio. You were a jazz man, basically?     Yes.    So how did it occur to anyone to have you as the chairman?     Well, I had started a programme which is even longer running than this one in 1967 which was a jazz programme called The Best of Jazz and that still goes out on Monday nights. That's been going for 33 years or something. So, they knew that I could talk in a microphone. I did the pilot, and when they came through and said they were going to put it on the air, I had already some dates in the book with my band and so on. So Barry did the first one, he may have done a few more than the first one in the series, and I took it up from then.     You were sustaining a pretty hefty tour schedule during all this. Tim and Graeme were making The Goodies all through the 70s. When did you find time?     Well, it's not very time consuming because we do, we record them two at a time, and of course we do them in huge theatres - I think 1400 at Milton Keynes was the biggest, so that occupies… we do six in the spring, that means three usually Sunday nights and six more in the late autumn. So, that's only really six days out of the year so it doesn't occupy an enormous amount of time. The teams usually arrive a day earlier and sort out some things like the musical games. I just stroll in right before the recording goes on.    I notice you had a quick read through the cards. Is that about as much preparation as it takes now?     I have to do that because, as Jon Naismith told the audience tonight, he brought on Iain Pattinson who for ten years has written my introductions and the leads in to the different little games. And some people say ""We thought it was you"". For me, it's a bigger challenge, it's much harder to do and much more rewarding to do well, then just to think up stuff of your own, hit or miss, because you've got to see to it that you don't torpedo any of his punch lines. And therefore you have to think about the timing and judge it correctly so that, for instance, a good joke doesn't disappear in laughter or applause or anything like that.    Although a good portion is written down, there do seem to be these occasional ad-libs that basically bring the house down.     Well, it's all part of my persona on the programmeme of a grumpy chairman. When I first did the first real show, not the pilot, I drove in thinking ""What am I going to do? I've got four professional comedians, comic actors... I can't chip in with anything worth chipping in"". By the time I got to the theatre, I thought ""Well, that's is exactly how I will present myself: as somebody who has come in the midst of all these people and there's a slight hint that he doesn't really want to be there and slightly grumpy about everything"". And I've done that for 30 years now.    More...     "
298,"An undiscovered Caravaggio painting may have been found in Rome, according to the Vatican newspaper.  The painting depicts the martyrdom of St Lawrence and belongs to the Jesuits in Rome.  It will now be examined in detail by art historians to find out if it really is the work of the famous Baroque painter.  Italy celebrated the life of the great master over the weekend on the 400th anniversary of Caravaggio's death.  A gallery housing his work and several churches stayed open overnight to mark the anniversary.  An image of the work was published on the front page of the Vatican's L'Osservatore Romano on Saturday.  It shows a semi-naked man, with one arm outstretched as he leans over leaping flames beneath him.  But while the Vatican newspaper article points out that the painting is typical of Caravaggio's style - such as the perspective from which the subject is seen - it conceded that no known document mentions St Lawrence in relation to Caravaggio.  ""In certain moments, such as Caravaggio's anniversaries, it's no surprise that a lot of paintings come out that are supposedly Caravaggio's work,"" Marini told the AP news agency.  Caravaggio was born in either 1571 or 1573, according to varying scholars, and spent the last few years of his life fleeing justice in southern Italy.  Caravaggio was famed for his wild lifestyle - he was often involved in street violence, culminating in him stabbing and killing a man before going on the run in 1606.  He fled to Naples and died four years later in the town of Porto Ecole.  His works include Bacchus, The Supper at Emmaus and Sacrifice of Isaac.  A group of Italian researchers recently revealed they had found human remains found in a church in Tuscany almost certainly belong to Caravaggio."
299,"There has been a rise in GP prescriptions for alcohol dependency Hospital admissions linked to alcohol use have more than doubled in England since 1995, an NHS report shows. Alcohol was the main or secondary cause of 207,800 NHS admissions in 2006/7, compared to 93,500 in 1995/96. There has also been a 20% rise in the number of GP prescriptions for treating alcohol dependency in the past four years, the NHS Information Centre said. The British Liver Trust warned that the health impact of alcohol would only get worse in years to come. Tim Straughan, chief executive of the NHS Information Centre, agreed that alcohol was placing an ever-increasing burden on the NHS. We are talking about a younger age group, drinking sometimes huge quantities, which can be damaging    ""These rises paint a worrying picture about the relationship between the population and the bottle,"" he added. The figures include hospital admissions for a specific alcohol-related condition - such as liver disease, but also admissions where alcohol is a contributory factor but not the main cause - such as falls due to drunkenness. Of hospital admissions in 2006/7 specifically due to an alcohol-related diagnosis, almost one in 10 were in under 18 year olds. In 2006 there were 6,500 deaths related to alcohol, of which two thirds were men - a 19% rise from 2001 figures. The north west had the highest rate of alcohol-related admissions at 170 per 100,000, while the lowest was the east of England which had 72 per 100,000. Survey results also contained in the report showed more pupils aged 11 to 15 years who say they have never had an alcoholic drink increased from 39% in 2001 to 45% in 2006. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. But those who admit to drinking are drinking more - consuming 11.4 units per week on average, the highest figure ever recorded by the survey. And 30% of 15 year olds said it was fine to get drunk at least once a week, the poll of over 8,000 teens found. Among adults in 2006, 72% of men and 57% of women reported drinking an alcoholic drink on at least one day in the previous week. And 12% of men and 7% of women reported drinking on every day in the previous week. Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader According to the NHS Information Centre alcohol was 69% more affordable in 2007 than in 1980. Dr Varuna Aluvihare, a liver specialist at Kings College Hospital said: ""We are talking about a younger age group, drinking sometimes huge quantities, which can be damaging. ""We are seeing people in their 20s and 30s. When I started practising, we saw people in their 50s."" Frank Soodeen, spokesperson for Alcohol Concern said the figures confirmed what they had heard from frontline NHS staff. ""The government needs to shape a response that meets the challenges thrown up by this bulletin. ""Information campaigns are a great first step, but we also need urgent investment in treatment systems that help steer problem drinkers away from harmful behaviour before they develop chronic conditions."" Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said the government was working harder than ever to reduce alcohol-related hospital admissions. ""The NHS spends £217m a year on specialist alcohol treatment and I have just launched a £6m campaign to make sure people know their units and know how much they're drinking."" Alison Rogers, chief executive of the British Liver Trusts said: ""This is set to hit England hard over the following years because liver disease can take up to 10 years to develop. ""We need action now to protect people's health to stop health harm from alcohol spiralling out of control.""     "
300,"Whittle was a Royal Air Force officer who made a major contribution to the invention of the jet engine  Frank Whittle was born on 1 June 1907 in Coventry, the son of a mechanic. His first attempts to join the RAF failed as a result of his lack of height, but on his third attempt he was accepted as an apprentice in 1923. He qualified as a pilot officer in 1928.  As a cadet Whittle had written a thesis arguing that planes would need to fly at high altitudes, where air resistance is much lower, in order to achieve long ranges and high speeds. Piston engines and propellers were unsuitable for this purpose, so he concluded that rocket propulsion or gas turbines driving propellers would be required. Jet propulsion was not in his thinking at this stage. By October 1929, Whittle had considered using a fan enclosed in the fuselage to generate a fast flow of air to propel a plane at high altitude. A piston engine would use too much fuel, so he thought of using a gas turbine. After the Air Ministry turned him down, he patented the idea himself.  In 1935, Whittle secured financial backing and, with Royal Air Force approval, Power Jets Ltd was formed. They began constructing a test engine in July 1936, but it proved inconclusive. Whittle concluded that a complete rebuild was required, but lacked the necessary finances. Protracted negotiations with the Air Ministry followed and the project was secured in 1940. By April 1941, the engine was ready for tests. The first flight was made on 15 May 1941. By October the United States had heard of the project and asked for the details and an engine. A Power Jets team and the engine were flown to Washington to enable General Electric to examine it and begin construction. The Americans worked quickly and their XP-59A Airacomet was airborne in October 1942, some time before the British Meteor, which became operational in 1944.  The jet engine proved to be a winner, particularly in America where the technology was enthusiastically embraced. Whittle retired from the RAF in 1948 with the rank of air commodore. He was knighted in the same year and went to work in the US shortly afterwards, becoming a research professor at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis. Whittle died on 9 August 1996."
301,"The rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army have thought long and hard about whether they should attend peace talks in Paris at the weekend.  For now, though, the killing goes on and it has taken a new turn with a spate of terrorist attacks on bars and cafes in the capital, Pristina.  ""Not many Serbs can you now find after three pm or four pm. Nobody travels during the night because people are scared. The KLA is again on the roads.""  At lunchtime in an Albanian bar I visited it is busy but, at night, it is a different story. Like the Serbs, many Albanians dare not venture out after dark.  One Albanian resident, Linda Gusia told me: ""It's terrifying because it's different when you go and fight with a gun and it's different when you die drinking coffee. It's really stupid when you die drinking coffee. It's terrifying. You don't feel safe anywhere. You have this feeling of insecurity wherever you go.""  Until recently, most of this conflict has been confined to the countryside but in the capital Pristina there is a palpable sense of fear that it, too, could be engulfed in the fighting if the peace talks fail.  For the residents of the city, the ultimate nightmare is that their hometown could become another Sarajevo."
302,"Earlier reports quoting both Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and unnamed military sources had suggested that commandos crossed the border to prevent a flood of refugees.  Kurds in northern Iraq also told the Reuters news agency that no Turkish forces had arrived.  The denial comes amid fears that any incursion by Turkish trooops would raise tension with Iraqi Kurds and Turkey's Nato allies.  Turkish officials have in recent days repeated their determination to deploy the army in order to strengthen the security along the 300km-long border (about 190 miles).  But the US opposes such a move, fearing clashes between Turkish forces and Iraqi Kurdish factions and has repeated its objection to any unilateral move by the Turks into the area.  Turkey wants to prevents the Kurds forming a separate state. Iraqi Kurds say the presence of Turkish troops would threaten Iraq's territorial integrity.  The BBC's Jim Muir, who is in northern Iraq, says Iraqi Kurds fear a Turkish move would be directed against them rather than the Iraqi army.  Although the two main Kurdish factions are not threatening to attack the Turks, they have both said that the Kurdish people would not accept a Turkish presence and that sooner or later there would be trouble.  German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer threatened to withdraw its crews from Nato Awacs surveillance planes patrolling Turkish airspace if Ankara orders an invasion of Iraq.  After a long debate, Turkey decided to open its airspace to US warplanes attacking Iraq on Friday.  Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters the airspace agreement with the US was ""in Turkey's interests"".  Friday's agreement came after earlier talks between Turkey and US failed to resolve their differences.  Before the deal was announced, US Secretary of State Colin Powell had said: ""At the moment we do not see any need for any Turkish incursions into northern Iraq.""  The US originally asked Turkey to grant permission for 62,000 of its troops to use the country as a launch-pad for an attack on Iraq.  Turkey would have received a multi-billion-dollar compensation package in return, but US officials say the financial package has now been withdrawn.  Correspondents say that the airspace agreement allows an air bridge to be established to ferry special forces to a number of airfields in Kurdish-held northern Iraq.  This enables a northern front to be mounted against Iraqi Government forces."
303,"On 21 June, 1940, more than 1,300 bewildered children arrived in Glasgow - a city most of them had never even heard of.  Only two days before, these youngsters had been enjoying a carefree afternoon, swimming or playing after school on the beautiful and peaceful island of Guernsey.  The Channel Islands had been largely unaffected by the start of the war.  But that summer, the sound and flashes of gunfire could be seen and heard across the sea in nearby France. The German army was advancing.  The British government decided the Channel Islands could no longer be defended.  On Guernsey, all children aged five to 14 were evacuated, unless their parents chose to keep them with them.  It was the stuff of nightmares.  To send your children away to an unknown place, in the hope they'd be taken in by strangers - not knowing when, or even if, you'd see them again.  In the middle of the night, at schools around the island, parents hugged their youngsters and waved them off.  Clutching pillowslips or bags containing a couple of vests, pants and socks, perhaps a favourite toy, something to eat on the journey, the children were bundled on to buses.  They were driven to an assortment of waiting ships in the harbour, many coming straight from the Dunkirk landings.  Arriving on the south coast of England hours later, they were checked over, fed and watered and bundled onto trains heading north.  Most of these young people had never been on a ship before. They'd never left the island.  They'd never seen a train, a busy road - or a black and white cow.  The youngest were terrified, grief-stricken and missing their families. They'd left behind everything and everyone they'd ever known.  Some of the older kids regarded it as all as a bit of an adventure. For the teachers and helpers accompanying them, it was an onerous responsibility.  Church halls around the city of Glasgow had been preparing for the mass influx.  At St Ninian's on the south side, rows of beds were lined up.  Volunteers were on hand to welcome the evacuees. It was ironic, when so many of Glasgow's own children had already been sent out of the city.  Over the coming days and weeks, the majority of children were billeted with families who offered them a temporary home.  But siblings were often separated, and many of the placements were far from successful and hugely traumatic. For many, it was a lonely and unhappy time.  The bustling, dirty, noisy city and the strange accent were a world away from the sea and sands of Guernsey.  Others settled in quickly, welcomed by loving families. They thrived on the excitement of the big schools, buses and trams, cinemas, dance halls, and holidays in the likes of Rothesay.  Most of the evacuees who spent the rest of the war in Scotland did their growing up in their five years here.  Back on Guernsey, the Germans had invaded within hours of the evacuation.  Under German occupation life was hard - made worse by the worry over what had happened to the island's children.  It was months before most parents heard that their offspring were alive and being cared for in Scotland.  Telegrams from the Red Cross were the only form of communication for the remainder of the war.  A maximum of 25 words, sent through the organisation in Geneva, provided treasured news.  These carefully worded, coded messages are a poignant reminder of that long separation.  In 1945, at the end of the war, the majority of the children made the return trip home to families who barely recognised their grown-up, independent offspring.  They'd come back to Guernsey ""talking Scotch"" and telling stories of a very different life.  Many missed their adopted families in Scotland, and maintained contacts with friends made there throughout their lives.  Now in their 70s and 80s, they can look back on a time and experience which shaped their lives."
304,"Animal lovers have kicked up a stink in Vienna where horses could be ordered to wear nappies.  The city council has proposed that all horse and carriage drivers should put nappies on their animals to stop them going to the toilet in the street.  They reckon animal poo in the streets could put off tourists, and say it costs thousands of pounds a year to clean up.  But the horse and cart drivers, and animal rights people, think it's outrageous.  They say it would be uncomfortable for the horses, would stop them being able to flick away flies with their tails, and it would look ridiculous!  Campaigners against the idea lined up in the streets of Vienna, wearing nappies themselves, which spelt out the words 'Stop pooh bags'.  There are 140 horse-drawn carriages in Vienna, and all of the drivers are against the plan.  Now they've just got to wait and see if the council passes the motion."

This year's theme is record-breaking - and the team aim to break a record every 45 minutes during the TV broadcast.  Over four million of the charity's squeaking red noses have already been sold at shops across the UK.

308,"It is a fascinating, but hazardous, idea to attempt to revisit characters from Anton Chekhov's plays a couple of decades on in their lives.  Brian Friel's Afterplay engineers a late collision in a Moscow cafe between Andrey, the hen-pecked brother of the Three Sisters, and Uncle Vanya's self-abnegating niece, Sonya.  How better to glimpse such fascinating café life than to step in off a street in Soho through the doors of a gilt, old-world theatre like the Gielgud and find such fine actors as John Hurt and Penelope Wilton at the table?  But as the play unfolds and Friel rounds out Chekhov, one cannot help but wish that the characters here had been as unfamiliar from the outset as real strangers at another table.  Not that this is any less a poignant and memorable work than other Friel plays such as Dancing At Lughnasa, the bitter sweetness of which it shares.  If the dialogue is, as Sonya puts it, about ""living alone and how to manage it"", it is full of humour and none more so than when they pin down Andrey's ""little fables, tiny fictions and small untruths"".  It is a rich pleasure to see the pair grow closer, teasing each other out over tea and vodka, only to stumble at the inner, emotional reef which emerges from Sonya's surface worldly wisdom.  One wonders if someone who had never seen Chekhov could appreciate Afterplay in its own right, so numerous are the references to the earlier plays.  For those who know them, it can be hard going - would Uncle Vanya have taken a gun to his rival had he been the ""benign, bumbling creature"" this Sonya recalls.  Would Andrey's grasping wife Natasha really have let go her all-important children?  But character aside, there is the difficulty of believing that the Bolsheviks would deal so leniently with a daughter of nobility and the son of a tsarist general.  Perhaps one could imagine a meeting between them as emigrés in Istanbul or Paris but the idea of Sonya being in Moscow to negotiate the management of her country estate with the ""Agriculture Ministry"" is surreal.  Yet blur the details and the references and you have before you an encounter between two lonely souls flickering into eager life again like strangers chatting in a theatre foyer, after the play is over.  Afterplay, which had its world premiere this year at the Gate Theatre Dublin, is showing at the Gielgud Theatre in London until 8 December."
309,"The original 1972 inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, led by Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, was immediately dismissed as a ""whitewash"" by the relatives of the victims and the wider nationalist community. Thus began a long campaign for a fresh public inquiry into the events of that day.  Indeed, the official position of the British establishment quickly distanced itself from the conclusions drawn by Widgery. The following year, the Coroner, Hubert O'Neill, called the killings ""sheer, unadulterated murder"". Then, in 1974, the Ministry of Defence made 'goodwill' payments to the families of the victims, but without accepting responsibility for their deaths.  In 1992, then British Prime Minister John Major wrote to John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's nationalist SDLP and long-time Bloody Sunday campaigner, expressing the view that the British government had ""made clear in 1974 that those who were killed on 'Bloody Sunday' should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives.""  There had also been strong pressure from the Irish government, which published an assessment of new evidence relating to Bloody Sunday in June 1997.  It was against this political backdrop that British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced in January 1998 that the events of Bloody Sunday would at last be re-examined through a new, public and independent judicial inquiry.  The Bloody Sunday Inquiry, headed by Lord Saville of Newdigate, began on 3 April 1998. In his opening speech, Lord Saville said that his duty was to seek the truth and carry out that duty ""with fairness, thoroughness and impartiality"". Oral hearings commenced at Londonderry’s Guildhall on 27 March 2000 with an opening statement by Sir Christopher Clarke QC, Counsel to the Inquiry. It was the longest in British legal history, not concluding until June of that year.  Over four-and-a-half years, the inquiry heard testimony from nearly a thousand people - more than half of them civilians. Among the most dramatic was that of Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness. He confirmed in his statement to the inquiry that he was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry at the time of the Bloody Sunday shootings, the first time he had acknowledged his IRA membership. At the time, McGuinness was the serving education minister in the devolved Northern Irish government.  Giving evidence in November 2003, McGuinness denied a claim by the British agent 'Infliction' that he had fired the first shot on the day, describing the agent as ""a fantasist"". The inquiry nonetheless found that McGuinness was ""probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this.""  The inquiry also considered fresh evidence calling into question the leadership of the British Army in Northern Ireland. Classified papers drawn up three months before Bloody Sunday by the head of the British Army, General Michael Carver, raised the prospect of an operation to ""root out the terrorists"" in so-called 'no-go' areas of Derry.  A memo from General Robert Ford, the army commander in Northern Ireland, stated: ""I am coming to the conclusion that the minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ring leaders amongst the DYH (Derry Young Hooligans), after clear warnings have been issued.""  The Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry was delivered at the Guildhall in Derry on 15 June 2010.  Lord Saville concluded that ""firing by soldiers of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number, none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury. What happened on Bloody Sunday strengthened the Provisional IRA, increased nationalist resentment and hostility towards the Army and exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed. Bloody Sunday was a tragedy for the bereaved and the wounded, and a catastrophe for the people of Northern Ireland.""  The inquiry was estimated to have cost around £200 million. It sat for 444 days and took evidence from more than 900 witnesses. Following the report, British Prime Minister David Cameron made a statement to Parliament, saying that ""what happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable"".  For the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday, the Saville Inquiry had finally vindicated those who were killed and the report was hailed as a victory for their campaign."
310,"Russia has not put its clocks back for winter this year, after President Dmitry Medvedev decided the country would stay permanently in summertime.  Mr Medvedev announced his decision in March, saying it was in order to relieve the stress of changing clocks.  Officials at the time talked about an annual increase in suicides.  It means that this winter in Russia the mornings will be darker for longer, but there will be more daylight in the afternoons.  So, as almost all of Northern Europe set its clocks back overnight, Russia did nothing, opting instead to remain on summertime for the whole year.  But because Russia is almost alone in sticking to summertime it has meant that businesses like banks, and in particular airlines and railways, have had an extra complication this autumn."
311,"Guernsey firm Healthspan has announced it is launching a legal challenge to the UK's decision to end VAT relief on Channel Island goods.  Derek Coates, the group's chief executive, said: ""We are in the process of launching a legal challenge, perhaps in the form of a judicial review.""  He said it followed advice from accountants and UK lawyers and would be pursued ""on the basis of discrimination against the Channel Islands"".  The tax relief is to end on 1 April.  The abolition of Low Value Consignment Relief - or LVCR - was announced by the UK treasury earlier.  LVCR allows companies to send goods below a certain value to the UK without having to pay sales tax. That value was lowered from £18 to £15 on 1 November, a decision made on 23 March.  The relief was set up in the 1980s with the intention of reducing the cost of collecting trivial amounts of the tax.  Mr Coates, whose company sells health supplements from Guernsey, said the decision was ""not wholly unexpected"".  However, he said: ""What is surprising and disturbing for all the Channel Islands is the way the UK have treated our islands with such disdain.  ""They have taken no steps to stop LVCR imports from any other country outside the EU including Switzerland, Cyprus, Hong Kong, the USA or China.""  Mr Coates said it was likely that the group's long-term warehousing and postal operations would be moved off the island.  However he reassured customers that ""we don't foresee any significant changes to our customer service"".  ""Healthspan is a Guernsey based business that I started here in the island because I am a Guernseyman,"" he said."

All eight signatures are included on the rear of the menu card, which was acquired by the seller's father, who was the British Ambassador to Belgrade.  It was the ambassador who introduced the players on the pitch before the game against Red Star Belgrade in February 1958.  The air disaster claimed the lives of 23 people connected to the club, including players, officials and journalists."
313,"Ashes belonging to one of the founders of psychoanalysis, Alfred Adler, are being returned to Austria after languishing in Edinburgh for 70 years.  The remains were rediscovered in the city's Warriston Crematorium after a search in 2007.  They had been there since Adler's death from a suspected heart attack while on a visit to Aberdeen in 1937.  Adler, a former colleague of Sigmund Freud, is credited with identifying the concept of the inferiority complex.  He rose to prominence as the founder of the school of individual psychology and for his work with Freud in the early 1900s.  Born Vienna on 7 February 1870, Adler died while on a three-week visit to Aberdeen University.  His funeral was held in the city but his casket sent south for cremation.  It was the honorary Austrian consul to Scotland, John Clifford who retraced the remains after being approached by the institute founded by Adler in his native Vienna.  Mr Clifford said he searched the city's records after discovering that only Glasgow and Edinburgh had cremation facilities at the time of Adler's death.  He said: ""Adler's casket was lost track of, only recently to be found again in Edinburgh at the Warriston Crematorium, where, in fact, it had been since 1937.""  The ashes are now set to be returned to Austria, where they will be re-interred in a grave of honour at the Central Cemetery of Vienna.  A civic reception, presided over by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, George Grubb, and Mr Clifford is due to be held later.  Also attending will be representatives of the Austrian Society for Individual Psychology and members from the Scottish Institute of Human Relations and of the British Psychoanalytical Society."
314,"It announced that the country would send a team to try to prove that the seabed beneath the North Pole was a natural continuation of Greenland.  The world's largest island is a semi-independent Danish territory whose northern tip is around 725km (450 miles) from the Pole.  Possible claimants to the area with the Pole also include Russia and Canada.  ""We're seeing a growing focus on and fight for the resources in the Arctic, especially as the global warming makes the region more accessible,"" Samantha Smith of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) told Reuters news agency.  Danish scientists hope to prove through hi-tech measurements that Greenland's continental socket is attached to a huge ridge beneath the floating Arctic ice, the Associated Press reports.  The country has allocated 150 million kroner ($25m) for the project on the Lomonosov Ridge and four other potential claim areas around Greenland, reports say.  Science Minister Helge Sander said last week that success would give Denmark access to ""new resources such as oil and natural gas"".  The Danish bid also rests on a UN convention that allows coastal nations to claim rights to offshore seabed resources.  Countries that ratify it have 10 years to prove they have a fair claim to the offshore territory and its resources.  ""First, we have to make the scientific claim. After that, there will be a political process with the other countries,"" science ministry official Thorkild Meedom said.  But experts have warned that it could take years to sort out the overlapping potential claims in the Arctic.  Canada and Russia are making similar investigations around the North Pole, the Associated Press reports."
315,"Democrat Bill Clinton has won the presidential election to become the 42nd United States president and the first in US history born after World War II. Democrat Bill Clinton has won the presidential election to become the 42nd United States president and the first in US history born after World War II. Aged 46, the Governor of Arkansas will be the third youngest president in US history after John Kennedy and Theodore Roosevelt. There was an unusually high turnout - always good news for Democrats - with an estimated 100 million Americans voting. The president-elect got 43% of the vote to Mr Bush's 38% with Independent Ross Perot trailing behind with 19%. If you will be my voice today, I will speak for you for four years   The Democrats conducted a highly effective campaign pushing aside allegations of Clinton's extra-marital affair with singer Gennifer Flowers and accusations of draft dodging during the Vietnam war. Instead they promised to lift America out of an economic quagmire, a message that has obviously won favour. Early results showed the Republicans were on their way out when their usual strongholds of Vermont and New Hampshire fell to their rivals. Democrats then began slicing into southern states like Georgia. Mr Perot has not won a single state despite spending an estimated $60m of his own money on his campaign. Clinton and his running mate Al Gore spent the last few weeks of the campaign on a whistle-stop bus tour of America. At dawn today they were at a rally in Denver, Mr Clinton's voice hoarse from speech-making. ""I have just about lost my voice,"" he said. ""If you will be my voice today, I will speak for you for four years."" He began the campaign more than a year ago with little hope of winning against President Bush whose popularity was high on the back of the Gulf War victory. But since then the economy has taken a serious turn for the worse and with it President Bush's standing in the eyes of US citizens. In his victory speech at Little Rock, Arkansas, Mr Clinton thanked his wife, Hillary, who stood by him during the Flowers sex scandal. He said the American people had voted for a ""new beginning"" and promised to tackle issues such as Aids, the environment and ""the conversion of our economy from a defence to a domestic economic giant"". He also paid tribute to President Bush for helping to bring an end to the Cold War and a victory in the Gulf War. It was an historic day for Congress too - the first black woman, Democrat Carol Moseley Braun, was elected to the Senate.     Among his successes as president were the Oslo accord between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993, the Dayton peace accord signed in former Yugoslavia in 1995, and the Northern Ireland ceasefire. At home he carried through major welfare reforms. But his first term was tainted by the Whitewater real estate scandal that questioned the Clintons' involvement in an Arkansas land deal dating back to 1978. They were only cleared of wrongdoing in 2000. Thanks to a booming economy, President Clinton comfortably won a second term against his Republican challenger, Bob Dole in 1996. His second term was dogged by the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal which he first vehemently denied and then admitted in a televised speech to the Grand Jury . After Kenneth Starr's report into Bill Clinton was published in September 1998, the House Judiciary Committee decided to impeach him and he became only the second president in American history to face such an indictment, but he refused to resign. His trial ended on 12 February 1999 when senators voted to acquit him of the impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.   "
316,"        I'm here with Colin Sell, famously the pianist on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Does it seem like 30 years? Were you there from the very beginning?      It sort of takes me by surprise actually that, yes, it's been going for 30 years. I joined it, I think, 28 years ago. I didn't do the pilot and I didn't do the first series and then I joined it. And the reason I joined it was because the very young producer, the very good producer who'd been asked to take it over was a chap called Simon Brett who of course has gone on to do lots of other things, writing books and plays and heaven knows what else. Bur he'd seen me do stuff up at the Edinburgh Fringe and he just took a complete chance on me and said ""I've been given this new program to do and I've heard you play and heard you write music and you improvise and you can kind of cope with most things that people throw at you musically and would you like to do it?"" So, that was back in 1974, I was in short-trousers of course then, I was a child prodigy really, and it took me a long time to get used to it because I was working, and I still am working, with people who are sort of my icons, really. You know, I was a teenager watching The Goodies and there was Barry Cryer and Humph Lyttelton playing jazz and all that, you know. And Willie Rushton who was an enormous name, particularly in the 60s. He made his name really doing That Was The Week That Was and so on. And suddenly, I was working with these people and so for about 10 years I kept thinking ""They're never going to ask me back"". Gradually over a period of time I've become, which is very nice for me, part of the set up. I don't do much on the programme, it has to be said if you actually analyse it, I don't do a great deal but I get a kind of reflected glory from it.     And there's a certain relationship on stage, at least, between you and Humph which people enjoy.      Yes, yes. They do. And actually, because we get on very well, it's good fun to play that sort of antagonist towards me. I just sit there and smile blithely at him and I don't have a microphone in front of me so if I want to make any comments, I have to really shout so we get this disembodied voice in the background which Humph always likes to play off and makes rude remarks about me.     So have you ever got together with Humph as pianist and trumpeter?      Only on a couple of occasions when we've done Christmas shows - he's had his trumpet there and we've done Christmas specials and he's played 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer', and we've worked then with his bass player and drummer as well. And there was a book launch we did some time ago, two or three years back, at Pizza Express and we had a quartet then. There was Humph and me and then his bass player and drummer. We did quite a lot of jazz playing which was very jolly. But no, we don't - apart from these odd occasions, we don't work together musically. The only thing is that many years ago I was asked to do the music for a radio version of 'Look Back in Anger' and Jimmy Porter, the character who plays the trumpet, so somebody said to me 'Well, why don't you get Humph Lyttelton to come and play it' which was a very good idea. It was kind of revenge for all the times that Humph Lyttelton had been rude to me in the program. We had a good laugh about it. I was actually getting him to come into the studio and play my music and do what I told him. Actually, it was smashing. We had a wonderful time. It was great. He did a very good version of what the sort of trumpet playing that Jimmy Porter would have done.     There's a huge love for the show across the country and Humph recently played trumpet on a Radiohead…      He did.     More...     "
317,"About 200 olive trees have already died from the contamination.  Qalqilya's problems highlight the fears of both Palestinian and Israeli environmentalists that Jewish settlers are regularly polluting the land, air and water of the occupied territories.  In the West Bank village of Beit Duqqu, residents complain that neighbouring Jewish settlements have been polluting their farmland for around 15 years.  And a kilometre outside the village stands a huge pile of their own rubbish lies smouldering half-burnt.  The refuse is dumped and burnt there - next to ancient Roman ruins - because Jewish settlers in nearby Hadasha settlement demanded that Palestinians stop using a more suitable site which necessitated them passing close by the settlement, Beit Duqqu residents say.  Villagers also say children have fallen ill after swimming in a local stream polluted by untreated sewage pumped from another settlement high on a nearby hilltop - Givat Zeev.  ""It's had a big impact on my livelihood,"" said local farmer Farouk, ""I've had to use lots of my savings to buy insecticide and each year the problem is getting worse""  The villagers say they have tried to meet the settlers to resolve the problem.  ""We tried to make three or four meetings with the leader of the settlement but he refused to talk about it and said 'we don't care',"" says Beit Duqqu community leader Akrima Ray.  Environmentalists maintain that the Israeli authorities are not doing enough to prevent pollution in the West Bank.  In April, Israel gave the go-ahead to settlers to convert a former Palestinian quarry into a dump for industrial waste from Israel and Jewish settlements in the West Bank.  A 2004 report by Friends of the Earth Middle East found that only 6% of Israeli settlements adequately treated their sewage.  The settlers account for only 10% of the population of the West Bank, yet produce 25% of sewage pollution, the study found.  The group also found that sewage from settlements was polluting the underground water aquifer that serves both Israel and the West Bank.  The Israeli Ministry of the Environment which is responsible for enforcing environmental standards in Israeli settlements only took steps against 14 of more than 60 colonies illegally discharging sewage, the FOEME report says.  This is partly due to the difficulties of enforcement in areas under Israeli military control.  Yet some measures have been taken against the West Bank's largest settlement, Ariel.  According to environmentalists, criminal proceedings were launched against Mayor Ron Nachman over the lack of sewage treatment facilities serving the town.  Despite this, the mayor recently criticised Palestinians on their own environmental record.  In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Friends of the Earth he cited possible Palestinian pollution of Gaza as a reason for the government to abandon its controversial plan to disengage from the area.  The settlers themselves say they have taken their own measures to protect the environment.  The Municipal Environmental Associations of Judea and Samaria was set up by settler councils to promote environmental awareness in the West Bank.  Their stated goals include a commitment to find solutions to sewage treatment problems and to work with the Palestinian Authority on environmental issues.  They also require environmental impact surveys be carried out on new building by settlers in the West Bank.  The Palestinian Authority itself has also been targeted by environmentalists for not doing more to prevent water pollution, despite the difficulties posed by the security situation.  Campaigners are calling for the PA to raise awareness of environmental issues as many Palestinians dispose of their sewage in cesspits that leak into the water table.  It is not just the settlers homes that are a source of pollution in the West Bank.  The industrial and manufacturing businesses that they operate are also a source of pollution, Palestinian environmentalists say, as many do not conform to Israeli standards.  According to environmentalists Barkan industrial zone, close to Ariel settlement, is responsible for producing untreated sewage and solid waste that is then buried on Palestinian agricultural land.  ""We have no problem working with people living in Israel but the settlers have a different mentality,"" says Dr Nadil Khateeb of the Water & Environmental Development Organisation in Bethlehem.  He fears that the settlement industries could cause serious health problems among Palestinians in the future.  ""Industrial waste can contain heavy metals, you only need a small amount to pollute a water supply and that could cause cancers.""  ""The problem is definitely getting worse because nothing on the ground has changed."""
318,"Miss Widdecombe, 60, announced she would not be standing for re-election in the Kent constituency of Maidstone and the Weald.  It follows Gordon Brown's decision not to call an autumn election.  She said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have made the last 20 years so rewarding.""  Ann Noreen Widdecombe became notorious for her eccentric appearance and her tough and hard-hitting political style.  She once said of herself: ""I am toothy, dumpy, ugly, overweight, a spinster - what the hell.""  She has often been the target of unkind remarks both from colleagues and the press, but has taken them unflinchingly.  She has had two major political spats with her own party members.  The first was when she famously said former Tory leader Michael Howard had ""something of the night about him"".  The other was in 2001 with Michael Portillo during his campaign to become party leader and his allies, whom she called ""backbiters"".  She said, had he won, she would never have given him her allegiance.  Miss Widdecombe attended the Royal Naval School Singapore and the La Sainte Union Convent in Bath.  She went on to earn degrees in Latin and Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Birmingham University and Oxford University."
319,"Lord Longford's campaign to secure the release of celebrated criminals, in particular the Moors murderer Myra Hindley, caused constant derision in the public and the press. While he could accept the label ""eccentric"", he objected to being called a ""saintly fool"". The second son of the fifth Earl of Longford, Frank Pakenham was educated at Eton and Oxford where he gained a First in Modern Greats. At 25, he joined the Conservative Party but his future wife Elizabeth, who he had met at Oxford, helped persuade him to become a socialist and convert to Roman Catholicism from the Irish Protestant ascendancy into which he had been born. They were married in 1931, and seven years later, Pakenham was adopted as prospective Parliamentary candidate for Oxford. Soon after the outbreak of World War II broke out he was invalided out of the army through illness. He suffered a nervous breakdown at the feeling of humiliation he felt and he said the experience left him with a deep compassion for the underdog. He decided to contribute to the nation's future through government instead He worked with Lord Beveridge, during the war, in his researches on social security - the ensuing Beveridge Report laid the foundations of the post-war welfare state. He became a Baron in 1945 and Clement Atlee gave him a succession of ministerial jobs in his government including Minister for Civil Aviation. His first cabinet post came under Harold Wilson as Lord Privy Seal and leader of the House of Lords. In 1965 he was appointed Colonial Secretary. He reverted to the office of Lord Privy Seal in 1966 but resigned two years later in protest at the decision to defer the raising of the school-leaving age. Lord Longford was an active social worker and was chairman of the National Society for Physically Handicapped Children, of Mencap, and of the National Youth Employment Council. He also presided over various inquiries relating to crime and punishment and the rehabilitation of ex-prisoners. In 1971, he set up his own private study-group with a membership ranging from the Archbishop of York to Malcolm Muggeridge and Cliff Richard, ""to investigate the incipient menace of pornography in Britain"". The group's report recommended more severe penalties for traders in pornography, steps to raise the moral standards of films, television and radio and a new definition of obscenity. Though the report stirred up wide public debate, it did not lead to any government action. Lord Longford, who succeeded his brother, the Sixth Earl, in 1961, had several books published including a study of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, works about crime and punishment, an official biography of Pope John Paul II and an autobiography. In later life, it was Lord Longford's prison visits and continued pleas on behalf of Myra Hindley that attracted debate. He described Myra Hindley as a ""delightful"" person and said you could loathe what people did but should not loathe what they were because human personality was sacred even though human behaviour was very often appalling. Each day he would read from the Gospels and pray four times. ""My whole aspiration is to live up to Christian standards"", he said. He enjoyed a long and happy marriage to Elizabeth Longford, the author and biographer, and they had eight children. Although he will be regarded by many as misguided, Lord Longford's courage and sincerity in pursuing unpopular causes in the face of formidable opposition and ridicule were unquestioned."
320,"They have drawn up an alternative system which they argue more accurately reflects the harm that drugs do.  The new ranking system places alcohol and tobacco in the upper half of the league table, ahead of cannabis and several Class A drugs such as ecstasy.  The study, published in The Lancet, has been welcomed by a team reviewing drug research for the government.  The Academy of Medical Sciences group plans to put its recommendations to ministers in the autumn.  A new commission is also due to undertake a three-year review of general government drug policy.  The new system has been developed by a team led by Professor David Nutt, from the University of Bristol, and Professor Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the Medical Research Council.  It assesses drugs on the harm they do to the individual, to society and whether or not they induce dependence.  A panel of experts were asked to rate 20 different drugs on nine individual categories, which were combined to produce an overall estimate of harm.  In order to provide familiar benchmarks, five legal drugs, including tobacco and alcohol were included in the assessment. Alcohol was rated the fifth most dangerous substance, and tobacco ninth.  Heroin was rated as the most dangerous drug, followed by cocaine and barbiturates. Ecstasy, however, rated only 18th, while cannabis was 11th.  The researchers said the current ABC system was too arbitrary, and failed to give specific information about the relative risks of each drug.  It also gave too much importance to unusual reactions, which would only affect a tiny number of users.  Professor Nutt said people were not deterred by scare messages, which simply served to undermine trust in warnings about the danger of drugs.  He said: ""The current system is not fit for purpose. Let's treat people as adults. We should have a much more considered debate how we deal with dangerous drugs.""  He highlighted the fact that one person a week in the UK dies from alcohol poisoning, while less than 10 deaths a year are linked to ecstasy use.  Professor Blakemore said it was clear that current drugs' policies were not working.  ""We face a huge problem. Illegal substances have never been more easily available, or more widely abused.""  He said the beauty of the new system, unlike the current version, was that it could easily be updated to reflect new research.  Professor Leslie Iversen, a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences group considering drug policy, said the new system was a ""landmark paper"".  He said: ""It is a real step towards evidence-based classification of drugs.""  Professor Iversen said the fact that 500,000 young people routinely took ecstasy every weekend proved that current drug policy was in need of reform.  Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker said: ""We have no intention of reviewing the drug classification system.  ""Our priority is harm reduction and to achieve this we focus on enforcement, education and treatment.""  He said there had been ""unparalleled investment"" of £7.5 billion since 1998, which had contributed to a 21% reduction in overall drug misuse in the last nine years and a fall of 20% in drug related crime since 2004.  But he added: ""The government is not complacent and will continue to work with all of our partners to build on this progress."""
321,"The fire started in the living room of the Buckinghamshire home late at night.  Black Sabbath star Ozzy and X-Factor judge Sharon were roused by a fire alarm and ran to safety in the garden, rescuing their pets as they escaped.  The couple were not injured in the fire, which happened on Good Friday, but were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation.  Two fire engines turned up at the home and four firefighters wearing breathing apparatus went inside to douse the flames.  Fire chiefs believe the cause may have been electrical. The extent of the fire was not immediately clear but it is believed to have caused damage running into thousands of pounds.  On Wednesday fire officers visited the couple to give them safety advice.  The blaze is the latest in a series of blows for the MTV reality show stars.  Last November the couple were burgled at the Chalfont St Peter mansion, with an estimated £2m-worth of jewellery stolen.  Eleven months before the burglary Ozzy had suffered a near-fatal crash on a quad bike."
322,"After nearly two years of investigation the Russian Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov has ordered the criminal case on the Kursk nuclear submarine disaster closed.  He told President Vladimir Putin and the Russian public that no-one, but a faulty torpedo was to blame for the loss of 118 lives.  To the victims' families the verdict is nothing short of a whitewash.  Many of them refused to accept it and are considering civil action to try to find out the truth.  The prosecution says it has nothing to hide and is offering the relatives free access to the 133 tomes of the case, even those containing military secrets.  But the question remains: Why was a state-of-the-art nuclear submarine, designed to withstand the full wrath of an enemy fleet, so easily destroyed by a practice torpedo, which didn't even have a warhead?  And why had the torpedo - which was apparently leaking explosive fuel - not been checked properly?  The prosecution admits mistakes were made by the Russian Northern fleet command during the preparation and conduct of the exercises that ended in tragedy.  But they allegedly had nothing to do with the disaster itself.  However, the fleet Commander, Vyacheslav Popov, and his chief of staff, Mikhail Motsak, were sacked by President Putin following the catastrophe.  This ambiguity reflects the general state of affairs in the Russian Navy and, indeed, the Russian armed forces.  The top brass still thinks of itself as a force to be reckoned with, while junior officers go unpaid for months, and essential supplies and maintenance procedures are cut short because of financial constraints.  Modern weapons produced by the Russian defence industry have been out of reach for the armed forces, the industry itself living from hand to mouth on foreign orders.  The need for a radical shake-up of the Russian armed forces, a reform that will make them leaner and meaner is obvious.  But the generals have been dragging their feet, fearing to lose their cushy jobs.  They were fairly sure that President Putin, who owed his election success largely to the military campaign in Chechnya, would not dare to touch them.  But the Kursk disaster turned the tables on them.  From the start the president was advised that the situation was under control and that he should stay out of it.  He took the advice and remained at his Black sea retreat. A huge public outcry ensued.  The Russians wanted to see their president at the scene of the tragedy.  That, apparently was the end of the influence the military had been exercising on President Putin.  He removed a professional general from the post of the defence minister, which in Russia has always been the domain of the military, and appointed the first ever civilian to run the armed forces.  The military was dumbstruck but from now on appears to be afraid openly to argue with the president.  He has been more active lately in his attempts to kick-start military reform, and the Russian army will get its first fully professional division as soon as August.  Still, it's a far cry from a modern and efficient army that the Kremlin is aspiring to have so as to be on truly equal terms with its Nato partners.  And the full truth about the Kursk disaster, the victims' relatives say, is as much needed by them as it is crucial for the future of the Russian armed forces."
323,"Millions of Scots are expected to fill in questionnaires on Sunday for the 2011 census.  More than 2.5 million forms were sent out to homes across Scotland in preparation for Census Day.  The population survey is collecting information on topics such as age, gender and health to help plan services like housing, hospitals and schools.  Citizens are required to complete the questionnaire and could face a fine of up to £1,000 if they fail to comply.  The form must cover any people living or staying with a householder on the night of 27 March.  Residents are expected to return their answers to the census organisers as soon as possible.  Personal data from the questionnaires will be kept confidential for 100 years.  For the first time, citizens have the option of completing the census online.  Disabled and older people have raised concerns about how difficult the form is to complete.  But Scotland's census organisers, the General Register Office for Scotland, said there would be extra support available online and on the phone over the few weeks. The helpline number in Scotland is 0300 1231702.  A website was set up for Scotland's Census 2011 to help people decide whether or not they speak or understand the Scots language.  The Aye Can site was prompted by the inclusion, for the first time, of a question about language.  The survey asks those living north of the border if they can understand, speak, read and/or write Scots.  The language includes Scottish dialects such as Glaswegian, Doric, Buchan, Dundonian or Shetland."

More than 100,000 people went on it in the first six months and the council gave permission for it to stay until January 2011.  The council said was looking at plans to replace it with a Christmas attraction and details would be released in the coming weeks.  Councillor Roger Davidson said: ""We believe the Wheel of Sheffield has been a success in the city and a welcome addition to our skyline.  ""Its stay in Sheffield was always a temporary arrangement which has been extended beyond the original timescale of six months and we appreciate and accept its owner's decision to move it to a new location so it can be in place for Christmas.

325,"A historical sex offence inquiry into singer Sir Cliff Richard has ""increased significantly in size"" and involves ""more than one allegation"", police say.  The expansion of the investigation meant no date could be given for when it would be concluded, South Yorkshire Police's chief constable said.  It comes after officers raided Sir Cliff's Berkshire home last August.  Sir Cliff, 74, said he had no idea where the ""absurd and untrue"" allegations against him come from.  ""The police have not disclosed details to me,"" he said in a statement.  ""I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so.""  Sir Cliff has been interviewed about an allegation of a sex crime, but was not arrested or charged.  The BBC understands the original allegation relates to an alleged assault at an event featuring US preacher Billy Graham at Bramall Lane in Sheffield in 1985.  In a letter dated 10 February to Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, Chief Constable David Crompton said his force was in regular contact with Sir Cliff's lawyers.  That involved a ""verbal update about once a fortnight"", he said.  ""This is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since its inception. Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers are aware that there is more than one allegation,"" he said in the letter.  He added: ""It would be premature and potentially misleading to predict a likely date when it will be concluded, however, we are progressing as swiftly as possible.""  Parts of the letter were blacked out before it was released.  A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had not been presented with a file for a charging decision.  ""The CPS is providing early investigative advice in relation to allegations of sexual offences committed by a 74-year-old man, interviewed by police in August 2014,"" it said in a statement.  ""The allegations remain under investigation by South Yorkshire Police.""  It comes after an independent report concluded that police should not have released ""highly confidential"" details to the BBC about the planned search of Sir Cliff Richard's home.  A deal over the details was made when a BBC reporter told the force he knew they were investigating the star.  The report looked into a subsequent agreement between South Yorkshire Police and the BBC, which led to the raid being broadcast live.  South Yorkshire Police had ""interfered with the star's privacy"" by telling the broadcaster about the raid, the report said.  A statement from Sir Cliff's lawyers at the time said the coverage caused ""immeasurable harm"" to the star.  A BBC spokesman said the Home Affairs committee had ""already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story.""  South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Dr Alan Billings, said six recommendations in the report ""will be implemented""."

Bahrain is notorious for jailing journalists, often for extended periods, says Reporters Without Borders.

The government uses the Press Law to curb criticism of Islam or the king, and supposed incitement to actions that undermine state security.  TV is the main source of news. Most domestic broadcasters are state-run. An opposition satellite station, Lualua TV, operates from London.  There were almost 1.3 million internet users by 2016 (Internetlivestats.com).

The company had appealed to the high court after Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott twice blocked the development, but the appeal was rejected in February last year.  The Ashton-under-Lyne store is planned to be built on the corner of Wellington Road and Oldham Road.  Mr Quinn,Tameside Council's executive member for jobs and new investment, said: ""It's brilliant news for Greater Manchester.  ""Not only are we bringing an iconic company into the area, we are also bringing with it 500 new jobs.  ""People look to towns where Ikea is and we believe that other new businesses will now look to Tameside.""  Scott Cordrey, Ikea's UK property manager, said: ""We're happy to have obtained such a good site in Ashton and glad that the plans have been approved.  ""It's fantastic news for Ikea and all our customers in Greater Manchester."""
328,"The air is filled with the sweet smell of incense burning in a corner of the huge hall.  Wrapped in shiny bright clothes, idols of Hindu gods and goddesses smile benevolently from the elevated platform.  Sitting on the white marble floor a group of more than 50 men, women and children sing devotional Hindi songs.  Nothing extraordinary about this scene, except that the temple is in Ghana and the devotees are all indigenous Africans.  The tall cone-shaped temple emerges out of the crowded neighbourhood of Orkordi on the outskirts of the capital Accra. It can be easily identified - the holy Sanskrit word 'Om' shines on its top.  The devotees here have no links with India and have never visited the country. Still they strictly follow religious rules and observe rituals in traditional Hindu way.  They say they have all converted to Hinduism but many still use their Christian names and African surnames.  However, they give their young ones Hindu names like Rama or Krishna.  Once inside the temple, you forget that you are a continent away from India.  Diyas or little lamps are lit in obeisance to the gods. Surprisingly, there is even a picture of Jesus Christ amid the idols of Hindu deities.  Come evening and the devotees gather in the temple hall for evening prayer rituals. Holy offerings to the gods are distributed after prayers.  Swami Ghanananda Saraswati, the man who established Ghana's first African Hindu Monastery in 1975, oversees the prayers sitting in a high chair.  Dressed in a flowing saffron kurta and a wrap-around, he addresses the people on the public address system and explains the finer points of the Hindu faith and philosophy.  ""I was born in a village nearby into a native Ghanaian faith,"" he says.  But his parents converted to Christianity. ""From a very early age I would think about the mysteries of the universe and try to find the answers in religious texts. But I failed,"" Swami Ghanananda says.  Then he read some books on Hindu faith and embarked upon a new journey which took him to Rishikesh in north India.  He spent some time there with a spiritual guru who suggested him to open the monastery in Accra.  Ask Swami Ghanananda his original name and the reply comes promptly: ""My real name is Guide!""  It's not been easy for him to keep the faith.  He says initially he faced some opposition from a section of the local people, but then the number of visitors started growing.  ""We don't ask anyone to convert to Hinduism. Those who seek the truth enquire about the Hindu monastery. We write articles in newspapers before we observe big Hindu festivals like Navaratri or Dipawali,"" says DG Otchere, manager of the temple.  He says that when a devotee died recently, a local TV channel covered his cremation because burning a body on pyre was unusual in Ghana.  There is even one Muslim among the devotees.  Jamer Baroudy says he was born into the Islamic faith but his mother introduced him to Hinduism when he was eight years old.  Mr Baroudy says: ""I am aware that Islam prohibits idol worshipping but then God doesn't make any distinction. I visit this temple because I find solace here.""  Today there are more than 2,000 indigenous African Hindus in Ghana who come to the temple quite regularly.  The total number of Hindus, including those from India, is much larger.  Hindu religion was first introduced in Ghana by Sindhi settlers who migrated to Africa after India was divided in 1947. There is still a Sindhi temple in Accra."
329,"Strange natural phenomena have been witnessed in North Korea since the death of the country's leader Kim Jong-il, the state news agency KCNA reports.  Ice cracked on a famous lake ""so loud, it seemed to shake the Heavens and the Earth"", and a mysterious glow was seen on a revered mountain top, KCNA said.  The personality cult surrounding North Korea's founding father and son bestows near-divine status on them.  Meanwhile, South Korean intelligence has questioned how Mr Kim died.  Citing US satellite photos, the country's national intelligence service director Won Sei-hoon said there was no sign that the special train, on which Mr Kim is reported to have died while on a visit on Saturday, had ever left Pyongyang over the weekend.  South Korea's president says Seoul is trying to show no hostility towards Pyongyang. Lee Myung-bak said a return to stability in the communist state was in the interests of the region.  Seoul is also sending its top nuclear negotiator to Beijing for talks on the situation in its northern neighbour.  In North Korea, state media continue to report mass grieving following Mr Kim's death, reportedly from a heart attack.  The 69-year-old had led North Korea since the death of his father in 1994 and an elaborate personality cult, involving multiple stories of alleged miracles or astonishing deeds, has been built up around him.  Even nature is mourning, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on Thursday.  A snowstorm hit as Mr Kim died and ice on the volcanic Chon lake near his reported birthplace at Mount Paektu cracked, it said.  Following the storm's sudden end at dawn on Tuesday, a message carved in rock - ""Mount Paektu, holy mountain of revolution. Kim Jong-il"" - glowed brightly, it said. It remained there until sunset.  On the same say, a Manchurian crane also apparently adopted a posture of grief at a statue of the late leader's father in the northern city of Hamhung.  ""Even the crane seemed to mourn the demise of Kim Jong-il, born of Heaven, after flying down there at dead of cold night, unable to forget him,"" KCNA reported officials as saying.  On Wednesday state media said more than five million people had already turned out to pay their respects to Kim Jong-il.  State media have called on North Koreans to unite behind his designated heir, youngest son Kim Jong-un, who is being called the ""Great Successor"".  Observers fear that because the transfer of power from father to son had not been formalised before Mr Kim's death, it could trigger instability. Regional neighbours are keenly watching events in the internationally-isolated nuclear-armed state.  South Korea, which remains technically at war with its northern neighbour following the 1950-1953 Korean War, put its military on a state of alert after Mr Kim's death was announced.  But it has also scrapped a plan to turn on controversial Christmas lights on the border that anger North Korea, and offered ""sympathies"" over the death.  ""The measures we have taken so far are basically aimed at showing North Korea we are not hostile toward the North,"" Yonhap news agency quoted the president as saying on Thursday.  ""An early stabilisation of North Korea's system is in the interests of neighbouring countries,"" he said. ""On future relations with North Korea, there is room for exercising as much flexibility as possible. We will discuss the matter with all political parties.""  Ties between the two Koreas have been very tense in recent months, following the sinking of a South Korean warship in March 2010 and the shelling of a border island in November 2010.  North Korea denies a role in the first incident and says Seoul provoked the second.  Relations have also been hit by Mr Lee's refusal to offer aid to Pyongyang without progress on the nuclear issue.  South Korea's nuclear envoy, Lim Sung-nam, is heading to Beijing to discuss how stalled six-nation talks aimed at denuclearising North Korea should be tackled in the wake of Mr Kim's death.  South Korean media have also accused Beijing of failing to communicate with Seoul since the announcement came."
330,"Afghanistan's Chief Justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told the Associated Press news agency no evidence had been produced against him.  ""Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin ... he is a free man,"" he said.  The Taleban Information Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, said the Taleban had now fulfilled their obligations concerning Osama bin Laden.  However, he said the Taleban had ordered him not to use Afghan soil for any activities against other countries and that he had accepted this.  Mr Muttaqi said that if from now on, any country raised the issue with the Taleban it would be viewed as an illogical excuse for attacking Afghanistan.  Earlier this month, the Taleban challenged the United States to provide evidence to back its allegations that the militant Saudi millionaire had masterminded the bombing of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  Shortly after the embassy bombings in August, the US launched cruise missile attacks against what it said were Osama bin Laden training camps in south Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan.  Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan for several years. He was involved in the fight against the Soviet occupying forces in the 1980s and was considered a hero for his part in this holy war, or Jihad.  He left Afghanistan after the Soviet army pulled out, ending up in Sudan. But moved on again after US pressure on the Sudanese Government.  He returned to Afghanistan, where is believed to have remained to this day, as a ""guest"" of the Islamic militia.  The American government offered a reward of $5m for his arrest, but the Taleban say that, as a Muslim, bin Laden should be tried in a Muslim country.  ""It is not just to try a Muslim man in front of a non-Muslim court,"" the Afghan foreign minister said."
331,"Russian teen pop duo Tatu have been forced to cancel their forthcoming UK tour dates because of poor ticket sales.  They have had to cancel two arena dates just days before they were scheduled to play the shows.  The dates, at London's Wembley Arena on Friday and Manchester's MEN Arena on Sunday have been pulled by promoters because ticket sales are so low.  Both venues have capacities of over 10,000, and the concerts were understood to have sold only a fraction.  Tatu hit the top of the UK charts earlier this year with their debut single All the Things She Said.  They courted controversy by appearing to be lesbians, and dressing in school uniforms in the single's video, which drew several complaints.  The concerts were announced earlier this year despite the fact the duo - Julia Volkova, 17, and Lena Katina, 18 - had only the one hit to their name.  A spokesman for the duo's label Interscope said on Wednesday they had no details as to why the concerts had been cancelled, other than that the promoters had decided to pull them.  ""The girls will still be coming in to London on Wednesday for promotion. We hope the concerts can be rescheduled for later in the year,"" he said.  The promoter, Red Square, was not available for comment on Wednesday.  Concerts at the two venues are usually only mounted by acts who have a string of hits or much bigger fanbases.  Recent acts who have played Wembley Arena include Counting Crows, Supergrass and pop band Blue.  ""Ticket holders are advised to retain their tickets and return to the original point of purchase for a full refund,"" a spokesperson for Wembley Arena said on Wednesday."
332,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has died of a heart attack at the age of 69, state media have announced.  Millions of North Koreans were ""engulfed in indescribable sadness"", the KCNA state news agency said, as people wept openly in Pyongyang.  KNCA described one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, as the ""great successor"" whom North Koreans should unite behind.  Pyongyang's neighbours are on alert amid fears of instability in the poor and isolated nuclear-armed nation.  Fears were compounded by unconfirmed reports from South Korean news agency Yonhap that the North had test-fired a missile off its eastern coast before the announcement of Kim Jong-il's death was made.  Unnamed government officials in Seoul were quoted as saying they did not believe the launch was linked to the announcement. The South Korean defence ministry has declined to comment.  Following news of Mr Kim's death, South Korea put its armed forces on high alert and said the country was on a crisis footing. Japan's government convened a special security meeting.  China - North Korea's closest ally and biggest trading partner - expressed shock at the news of his death and pledged to continue making ""active contributions to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in this region"".  Asian stock markets fell after the news was announced.  Mr Kim's death was announced in an emotional statement on national television.  The announcer, wearing black, struggled to keep back the tears as she said he had died of physical and mental over-work.  The KCNA later reported that he had died of a ""severe myocardial infarction along with a heart attack"" at 08:30 local time on Saturday (23:30 GMT Friday).  He had been on a train at the time, for one of his ""field guidance"" tours, KCNA said.  The state news agency said a funeral would be held in Pyongyang on 28 December and Kim Jong-un would head the funeral committee. A period of national mourning has been declared from 17 to 29 December.  Images from inside the secretive state showed people in the streets of Pyongyang weeping at the news of his death.  Ruling party members in one North Korean county were shown by state TV banging tables and crying out loud, the AFP news agency reports.  ""I can't believe it,"" a party member named as Kang Tae-Ho was quoted as saying. ""How can he go like this? What are we supposed to do?""  Another, Hong Sun-Ok, said: ""He tried so hard to make our lives much better and he just left like this.""  KCNA said people were ""convulsing with pain and despair"" at their loss, but would unite behind his successor Kim Jong-un.  ""All party members, military men and the public should faithfully follow the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un and protect and further strengthen the unified front of the party, military and the public,"" the news agency said.  Little is known about Kim Jong-un. He was educated in Switzerland, is aged in his late 20s and is believed to be Kim Jong-il's third son - born to Mr Kim's reportedly favourite wife, the late Ko Yong-hui.  Kim Jong-un was unveiled as his father's likely successor just over a year ago. Many had expected to see this process further consolidated in 2012.  South Korea - which remains technically at war with the north - urged people to ""go about their usual economic activities"" on Monday, while putting the military on alert.  President Lee Myung-Bak spoke to US President Barack Obama by telephone and they ""agreed to closely co-operate and monitor the situation together"", a South Korean presidential spokesman said.  Reaction from Washington was muted, with the White House saying it was ""closely monitoring"" reports of the death.  The US remained ""committed to stability on the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies"", it said in a statement.  China said it was ""distressed"" to hear the news of his death. ""We express our grief about this and extend our condolences to the people of North Korea,"" foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu was quoted by Xinhua news agency as saying.  Analysts say that with the process of transition from father to son incomplete, Mr Kim's death could herald ""very unstable times"" in North Korea.  ""We have to be very worried because whenever there is domestic instability North Korea likes to find an external situation to divert the attention away from that - including indulging in provocation,"" Professor Lee Jung-hoon, specialising in international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul, told the BBC.  Christopher Hill, former US representative to the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme, said all parties needed to ""keep cool heads"".  Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague said it could be a ""turning point"" for North Korea to engage more closely with the international community.  Kim Jong-il inherited the leadership of North Korea from his father Kim Il-sung.  Shortly after he came to power in 1994, a severe famine caused by ill-judged economic reforms and poor harvests left an estimated two million people dead.  His regime has been harshly criticised for human rights abuses and is internationally isolated because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons.  Under Mr Kim's leadership, funds have been channelled to the military and in 2006 North Korea conducted its first nuclear test. It followed that up with a second one three years later. Multinational talks aimed at disarming North Korea have been deadlocked for months.  He had reportedly been in poor health since suffering a stroke in August 2008."
333,"Manchester City have announced plans to increase the capacity of their ground from 48,000 to about 61,000.  The Premier League club will add a third tier behind the goals of the Etihad Stadium's North and South stands, subject to planning approval.  Tiers will include about 6,750 seats, with fans able to join a season ticket waiting list for the seats next week.  The club aim to submit the plans next month and hope work will start on the project in February.  City said the work would not impact season ticket holders attending home matches. The tiers are expected to be completed for the beginning of the 2015/16 season.  The team has played its home fixtures at the stadium since 2003.  A club spokesman said: ""Should the club's exciting plans receive planning approval, City's home, which this year celebrates its 10th birthday, is set to be even more visually dramatic"".  The stadium initially had a capacity of 38,000 when it was built for the Commonwealth Games, which were held in Manchester in 2002.  The planned expansion would see the stadium become the second largest in the Premier League, behind neighbours Manchester United's Old Trafford home which holds more than 75,000."
334,"James was involved in the 1488 rebellion that saw his father, James III, killed at the Battle of Sauchieburn. As a 15 year old boy, it is unclear what he expected as the outcome of the rebellion but it seems clear that he carried the guilt of his father's death into his adult life. After the battle James did penance for his role in the rebellion and was to wear a celice – an uncomfortable metal chain – around his waist for the rest of his life.  Like his forefathers, James' reign was marked by the factional interests of the nobles in his court and, like previous Stewart monarchs, James fought to counter these to centralise power in his own hands.  James IV has been acclaimed by historians as the first true Renaissance king of Scotland. Under his rule, James patronised the arts and sciences and Scotland flourished as a result. It was during his reign that the first printing press was established in Scotland (1305).  During the same period James brought order to the Scottish kingdom. In 1493 he finished the work of previous Stewart kings in effectively ending the influence of the Lords of the Isles. From that date onward, the King of Scots would hold that title.  In 1502 he signed the Treaty of Perpetual Peace with Henry VII of England that went some way to ease the traditional enmity between the two nations. To cap the new warm relations with the old enemy James married Henry's daughter, Margaret Tudor in 1503.  This was an important marriage for both nations. For Henry, the marriage into one of Europe's most established monarchies gave a patina of legitimacy to the new Tudor royal line. For James, the marriage raised the interesting opportunity of a future offspring of the marriage having a claim to the English throne.  The new peace and goodwill established between the two nations lasted until 1513 when international matters forced James to make the most difficult of decisions. As part of a long-running conflict in Italy, England and France ended up at war. Under the obligations of the Auld Alliance (signed by John Balliol in 1295) James was honour-bound to aid the French and invade England. This was naturally at odds with the Treaty he had signed with Henry VII in 1502.  James made up his mind. He declared war on England and led his army south. The campaign was a disaster. On the 9th September 1513 James led his army into battle at Flodden, Northumberland. The Scots were slaughtered with many of the Scottish nobility killed. James was one of that number.  As a final side note, James was the last King of Scots to speak Gaelic."
335,"The 45-year-old star led the group to global stardom with hits such as Karma Chameleon and Do You Really Want To Hurt Me in the 1980s.  The band recently recruited newcomer Sam Butcher for a UK tour in December.  Boy George said he had seen their video on MySpace. ""I wanted to like it but I couldn't,"" he said. ""They're my songs, they're my heart, they're my life.""  Original band members Jon Moss, Mikey Craig and Phil Pickett recruited 29-year-old Butcher through auditions this summer, after Boy George decided not to go back on tour.  Butcher was unveiled to media and fans at an intimate gig in London in July, where his colourful style and androgynous image echoed the persona of his predecessor.  Boy George added: ""They're my gay love songs about my boyfriend. He can't sing them, can he?  ""To me, the mark of a good band is when someone else can't successfully sing their songs, and he can't sing my songs.""  Culture Club said they wanted Boy George to sing with the band again but he refused, and that they did not want to be involved in sniping.  Butcher said: ""I wish George well with his new solo career. I am hurt by George's comments but realises George says terrible things about everybody, including Madonna.  ""I am just starting my career so it seems rather cruel to take pot shots at me. Maybe Boy George should keep it for the big boys like Madonna and George Michael.""  Boy George made his comments at the Vodafone Live Music Awards on Wednesday, where he also had a confrontation with several youths who were shouting abuse.  The singer marched up to the onlookers, who were taunting him through a door at the Camden Roundhouse venue, telling them he would ""knock your teeth out"" and calling them ""chavs"".  Boy George - fresh from sweeping streets in New York as part of community service - recently exhibited his clothing range at London Fashion Week.  He is also releasing a single, Time Machine, with Amanda Ghost, who co-wrote James Blunt's hit You're Beautiful."
336,"Newcastle continued their unbeaten start to the season as Ryan Taylor's stunning goal saw off Everton.  Everton defender Johnny Heitinga turned in Danny Simpson's inviting low cross before Taylor doubled the lead when he crashed in a 25-yard shot.  Jack Rodwell headed in a corner to give Everton hope and the visitors should have been given a second-half penalty when Dan Gosling handballed.  But Alan Pardew's side closed out a win which keeps them third in the table.  Newcastle are now undefeated in the league since a 3-0 loss at Liverpool in May - a run of 14 games - but face a tough test of their ambitions in their next three fixtures.  Pardew takes his side to Manchester City and Manchester United on successive Saturdays after the international break, with Chelsea visiting St James' Park the following week.  But the Newcastle manager will have been concerned at the sight of influential midfielder Yohan Cabaye limping off with a groin injury.  Midfielder Danny Guthrie had the first effort on goal after a corner had not been cleared before Everton had a chance to open the scoring.  Seamus Coleman dragged his shot wide after Louis Saha had flicked on a Royston Drenthe cross from the left.  It proved to be a costly miss as Heitinga inadvertently put Newcastle ahead moments later.  Simpson's cross from the right was dangerous and Heitinga could only turn the ball past Tim Howard with Leon Best lurking just behind.  Drenthe created two quick chances for Everton but Rodwell and Leon Osman both had efforts saved by Tim Krul before Saha got in behind a faltering offside trap but lacked composure and blazed over.  Taylor then opened up a two-goal cushion in spectacular fashion.  Rodwell headed a long throw clear to Taylor 25 yards from goal and the full-back chested the ball down and smashed in a shot which arched over Howard before hitting the underside of the crossbar and bouncing in.  Saha hit the post and Taylor saw a cross strike the crossbar before Cabaye limped off to be replaced by former Everton midfielder Gosling.  Rodwell then brought the half to an end when he headed in Drenthe's corner at the near post.  Everton started the second period strongly and should have had a penalty when Saha's shot was blocked by Gosling's arm.  James McFadden came on for his first appearance for Everton since January 2008 as David Moyes' side had plenty of late pressure but Newcastle comfortably held on for the three points.  ""We were unfortunate today as injuries cost us our rhythm but the guys who came on did a great job.  ""If we were at Goodison Park we would have got beat today. But the fans helped us.  ""Our defending was a different class in the second half and it was one of our best displays. When Everton scored just before half-time it affected us but our discipline and defending has got us a victory.  ""I hope the Toon enjoy it tonight. We are a new team, we didn't expect to be on this run but we are enjoying it. We've got Manchester City next, who are also unbeaten, so that could be a great game.""  ""It was a penalty we didn't get today but we've had a lot of that.  ""We were very fortunate against Fulham the other week and you earn your luck.  ""Our defending in the first half wasn't good enough, especially in the opening 20 minutes. It was a terrible own goal to concede.  ""We created enough chances in the first half to get something from the game.  ""We've got to do better and win some football games."""
337,"The 58-year-old veteran entertainer has long harboured suspicions that he was deliberately being denied airtime.  So he sent out a heavily remixed dance version of his latest single, Can't Keep This Feeling In, to 240 radio stations, under the name Blacknight.  Sir Cliff compiled the pseudonym from his producer's name Clive Black, and the fact that he is a knight of the realm.  He said that the plan had worked and he now has proof that trendy DJs have a playlist policy of ignoring his songs.  The Mail on Sunday reports London-based Choice FM DJ Jerry Bascombe as saying: ""It is a great record and it took about four days to realise the identity of the artist.  ""I suppose, to be honest, if we knew it was by Cliff we would have never played it, so it proves his point.  ""Now we'll go on playing it regardless.""  Simon Sadler, head of music at London's Kiss 100 FM, said: ""He does have a point, that some stations are prejudiced.  ""I have to say that if I did see his name on a record I'd find it very difficult to play it.""  Manchester station Key 103 told the newspaper they would ""never knowingly play a Cliff record"".  Sir Cliff, who has made 60 albums during his career, said: ""They've taken me off the playlists along with Phil Collins.""  But he said that he had ""given up worrying"" about it.  He added: ""I still have ambition in my soul.  ""I'm really thrilled that at least some of the black music stations were playing my music and didn't know it was me.  ""Stations package new bands, but children have ears and they deserve to choose for themselves what sounds they like."""
338,"Tottenham Hotspur has signed a deal under which specialist bank and asset management firm Investec will become its second shirt sponsor.  Software infrastructure company Autonomy is the White Hart Lane club's shirt sponsor in the Premier League.  Now Investec will become shirt sponsor for Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years.  The new shirt should be worn for a Champions League play-off first leg match away to Swiss side Young Boys.  This season Spurs are also involved in the FA Cup and League Cup competitions.  The club is also looking for a naming rights sponsor for its proposed new stadium.  The Autonomy deal is worth £20m, and the Investec deal is believed to be worth worth £5m over two years, although the club has not disclosed the value.  ""It seems if clubs can cut their sponsorship cloth a different way the can extend their offer to more than one brand,"" says Nigel Currie of sponsorship consultancy Brand Rapport.  ""I think that other clubs may now look at ways of increasing the value of their shirt sponsorship.""  However it remains to be seen how many fans will fork out for both shirts.  The move to split the shirt sponsorship between league matches and cup competitions is understood to have been the idea of club chairman Daniel Levy.  Autonomy and Investec are only the fifth and sixth brands to appear on the club's shirts, taking over from online betting company Mansion."
339,"Attitudes then and now The Royal Navy of Nelson's period has generally been painted in terms of men being pressed into service against their will, living in hellish conditions, and being tyrannised with the lash. As one historian has put it, the sailors toiled on a sort of 'floating concentration camp'. It would seem unlikely, however, that men pressed and beaten into servitude would provide the manpower that delivered such crushing victories as the battles of the Nile (1798) and Trafalgar (1805), and current research is doing much to re-cast the lives of the men and women of the lower deck. This new perspective shows a much more complex, rounded picture of life in Nelson's Navy. In Nelson's time Admiralty Regulations stated that women were not allowed to be taken to sea ... In Nelson's time Admiralty Regulations stated that women were not allowed to be taken to sea and that '... no women be ever permitted to be on board but such as are really the wives of the men they come to, and the ship not too much pestered even with them'. Whatever the rulebook said, however, it is nevertheless clear that women did travel aboard Nelson's ships - and in large numbers, although senior officers were not necessarily in favour of this. When a great personal friend of Nelson, Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, discovered that women had been brought onboard his flagship, he ordered the women ashore because of '... the mischief they never fail to create wherever they are'. He also wrote that 'I never knew a woman brought to sea in a ship that some mischief did not befall the vessel'. The Earl Saint Vincent, another friend of Nelson's, was also against women coming to sea, largely due to their washing their clothes in the ship's fresh water. In our own day, following some passionate debate, official attitudes towards women serving onboard Royal Navy vessels have recently changed. In 1993 women were officially allowed to go to sea onboard Royal Navy vessels, and the current Equal Opportunities Policy of the Royal Navy states that: 'As a result of changes to employment practice from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the percentage of women entering the Armed Forces doubled, and today 20 per cent of officer entrants are female'.  In Nelson's navy, warrant officers were the ship's specialist officers, and included the carpenter, gunner, cooper, purser and master (the person responsible for the ship's navigation and sailing). Their name comes from the fact that they received a warrant from the Admiralty, rather than a commission, which is what the captain and his lieutenants received. A number of these men took their wives and children to sea with them. The presence of the women was largely hidden, for official purposes, as they were not paid or fed by the Navy, and therefore were not entered onto the ships' muster books. However other records, such as order books written by ships' captains, refer to their existence, as do memoirs and records of courts martial. The presence of the women was largely hidden, for official purposes ... The story of George Casey, his wife, and Nicholas Maeger is a good example. On Friday 5 January 1797, Commodore Horatio Nelson was presiding over the court martial of Lieutenant Nicholas Meager of HMS Dromedary. Lieutenant Meager was charged by George Casey, the ship's Master, because he '... took hold of me by the nose and pulled with all his strength', in public view on the deck of the ship. Prior to the attack one witness recalled that 'I was walking on the larboard [left] side of the quarter deck, Mr Casey and his wife were walking on the starboard [right] side, the prisoner [Meager] came out of his cabin and as he passed Mrs Casey he spit in her face'. It is not recorded why Maeger spat in Mrs Casey's face, but this record attests to the fact that a warrant officer had his wife with him while at sea, was promenading with her in public view, and the court saw nothing unusual in this. And what is more, in a separate court martial also involving Casey and Maeger, it came to light that the Caseys also had a child, which stayed onboard with them.  Whenever Royal Navy ships of the period came into port, an armada of 'bumboats' immediately besieged them. Bumboats were small vessels that brought fresh vegetables, supplies and, most notoriously, prostitutes and drink to the warships. In port, most ships' captains allowed prostitutes onboard, and the men were in any case already issued with large quantities of drink - the standard allowance was a gallon of beer a man per day. If beer was not available, then a pint of wine or half a pint of spirits could be substituted. The warships of the day were very overcrowded, and each man was only allowed 14 inches in which to hang his hammock. Add large numbers of prostitutes to the overcrowding and heavy drinking, and the scenes below decks where the men lived must have been something to behold. A sailor wrote that, 'with the women came drink and what with the drink and the women the ship's discipline came to a stop. The men and women drank and quarrelled between the guns. The decks were allowed to become dirty. Drunken women were continually coming up to insult the officers, or to lodge some complaint. Sometimes the women ran aloft to wave their petticoats to the flagship'. Other women, disguised as men, are also known to have entered the Royal Navy, and to have served for some considerable time without detection. Much has been written about them, and while some of these stories are likely to be folk myths, there are a number of attested cases in which the women involved became minor celebrities. For instance Hanna Snell, the daughter of a dyer from Worcester, enlisted in the army in 1745, deserted, and then enlisted in the marines - who were shipboard soldiers (later to become the Royal Marines) who helped keep discipline onboard ship. Hanna saw action in this capacity, and was eventually badly wounded in both thighs. Despite this, her true sex was never identified, and she recovered from her wounds. In 1750 she revealed her true identity, became a celebrity and starred on the stage.  Royal Navy ships were constantly carrying passengers on board. These could be government officials coming or going to foreign stations, discharged invalids going home, or soldiers being transferred from one post to another - and a number of them were women. Out of every 100 men, three soldiers were allowed to bring their wives ... During the 1801 Egyptian campaign, over 60 Royal Navy vessels carried and escorted 12,000 troops to Aboukir Bay, Egypt, in an attempt to drive French forces out of Egypt. Out of every 100 men, three soldiers were allowed to bring their wives, which meant that there were at least 360 women in the fleet, as well as their children. These women and children are recorded in the ships' muster books. For instance the muster book of HMS Charon records that there were 30 women and 20 children onboard 'belonging to the 30th Regiment [now the Queen's Lancashire Regiment]'. After the successful landing in Aboukir Bay, many of the troopships were turned into hospital ships, and although some of the women and children left to join the army now camped ashore, many stayed on board ship, and volunteered to act as nurses to the sick and wounded. In appreciation of this, Admiral Lord Keith, the expedition's naval commander, allowed them to be fed from the ships' stores, and encouraged them to volunteer for this service. The Royal Navy of the time had a comprehensive health care system, which included compulsory vaccination against smallpox, free medical treatment for sailors, a sick bay and a surgeon on every ship - as well as an extensive network of hospitals and hospital ships. However, the nurses who attended the sick and wounded at these establishments had quite a bad reputation, and were continually being sacked for prostitution, drunkenness and helping the sailors desert. One sailor wrote that, '... those ladies are exceedingly bold and audacious ... I had a great deal to do to repulse the temptations I met with from these sirens'.  In 2000, Italian archaeologist Dr Paolo Gallo, while excavating Hellenistic and Pharaonic structures on Nelson's Island, Aboukir Bay, discovered a lost Royal Navy burial ground from Nelson's time. A British team was invited by Dr Gallo to excavate these burials, which subsequently revealed graves containing officers, sailors, soldiers, marines, women and children. A poignant discovery was that of three infants. Two were either stillborn or had died shortly after birth, and one had died at just a few months old. Each was buried in a wooden coffin, wrapped in a shroud held together with small bronze pins, and one had been carefully packed in wood shavings. ... women fought, nursed, accompanied their husbands ... and even enlisted in disguise to serve in Nelson's Navy Directly next to one infant was the grave of a woman in a wooden coffin, and it is likely that this was her child. She had been laid to rest in a dress, and her face had been covered with what looks like a handkerchief. On the coffin lid had been nailed a large metal letter 'G'. There are currently three possible candidates for this burial. John Nicol, one of Nelson's sailors who took part in the Battle of the Nile (1798), wrote that a woman from Leith, Scotland, was injured whilst serving the guns on HMS Goliath, subsequently died of her wounds, and was 'buried on a small island in the Bay'. Two other women from the army regiments from the 1801 expedition were recorded to have died on board the ships moored in Aboukir Bay. One was Mrs Lambe, of the 3rd Guards Regiment (now the Scots Guards), and the other was Sarah Webber of the Coldstream Guards. Any one of these could have merited the mysterious 'G' (standing perhaps for 'Goliath' or 'Guards'). The historical and archaeological record thus makes it clear that women fought, nursed, accompanied their husbands, gave birth, entertained and even enlisted in disguise to serve in Nelson's Navy. These findings have forced us to re-examine the social and organisational nature of Nelson's crews, and has painted a much fuller and more complex picture of those who inhabited the 'wooden world'."
340,"It is 17 years since a gang of armed, masked robbers burst into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport one November night, beat up and poured petrol over the security guards, and made off with the goods they were guarding.  It was a South London gang at work, but it was no ordinary London robbery.  The property under guard was gold. Three tons of gold: 6,800 bars of it, packed into 76 cardboard boxes. And two boxes of diamonds.  And some of the stolen goods ended up in Kenneth Noye's hands - he was jailed for 14 years for his crime.  The six-strong gang had planned the raid with meticulous care and got away with the biggest haul in British criminal history.  Years later, the vast bulk of the bullion remains unrecovered. Some gold was melted down by a businessman near Bath. Some simply vanished into a criminal underworld and reappeared in foreign bank accounts in Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, Miami and the Bahamas. In one short period, £3m cash was withdrawn from a bank in Bristol, requiring the Bank of England to supply so many notes that even the Treasury had to be informed. And the gang - even those eventually jailed - is believed to have become wealthy. Some, like Kenneth Noye, lived off the proceeds in luxury homes in the UK and the Costa del Sol.  After escaping from Heathrow with their haul, the robbers needed help to turn the gold into clean cash. They called upon criminals with specialist knowledge, and that was where Kenneth Noye came in. He was an expert in his field, and paid such attention to detail that he even mixed some of the gold with copper coins to change its purity and disguise its origins. Some men who had played a part in the raid were eventually brought to justice. Micky McAvoy and Brian Robinson were both jailed for 25 years. A third man, Anthony White was cleared because of a lack of evidence. But within a short time White, a benefit claimant who lived in a council house, had spent more than £400,000 buying and restoring homes in London and Kent. And in Spain police found £115,000 in cash and jewellery worth £100,000.  White was finally jailed for 11 years in 1997 for his part in a massive drug-smuggling ring. Also cleared of involvement was a businessman friend of Kenneth Noye, who admitted melting down gold bars from the raid but insisted he did not know where they had come from. Noye was jailed for helping launder the proceeds, but not before he had stabbed to death an undercover detective, John Fordham, who was staking out his Kent home in the search for evidence. However Noye was cleared of the murder after he pleaded self-defence. So a handful of men were jailed, but police think up to 15 people took part in planning and executing the robbery. They believe they know their names, and some of the bank accounts they opened in tax havens in Jersey and elsewhere. Despite dogged police work spanning nearly two decades, it it seems most of those involved have simply got away with it - and most of the gold will never be recovered. But some believe it is closer at hand. It is claimed in some quarters that anyone wearing gold jewellery bought in the UK after 1983, is probably wearing Brinks Mat."
341,"A lawyer for the Bloody Sunday inquiry has expressed concern that two rifles thought to have been fired on that day were destroyed by the army.  The Ministry of Defence admitted in January they had destroyed two guns which it had specifically promised the inquiry would be kept safe.  The new inquiry into the deaths of 14 people who were shot by British paratroopers at a civil rights march in Londonderry on 13 January 1972, which started last week, is expected to run for two years in the Guildhall, Londonderry.  Counsel for inquiry Michael Clarke, QC, said it was ""a matter for very considerable concern"" that two weapons were destroyed after the inquiry asked for them to be preserved and a bar placed on their movement from storage in Donington.  Mr Clarke, who is presenting all of the evidence which the inquiry has gathered has so far made little comment on the evidence.  Mr Clarke said the matter was being investigated by MoD police and the West Mercia Constabulary, but that initial investigations had shown the fault may have originated with the MoD's computer system.  He said that when a request is made to the MoD not to destroy a particular weapon, a warning only appears on its computer system after the weapon has actually been destroyed.  A total of 29 rifles believed to have been fired on Bloody Sunday were submitted to the first tribunal into Bloody Sunday, conducted by Lord Widgery, for examination and testing.  When the current Saville inquiry wrote to the MoD last October, the MoD said 22 of those guns had been had been given to companies for destruction and two had gone to a company for sale.  Two of the remaining weapons were destroyed in February.  Mr Clarke also said he wanted to deal with another section of evidence, which came under the heading of 'premonitions.'  He said some witnesses had a sense of foreboding before the Bloody Sunday march because they said they were told ""with some belligerence"" by paratroops at a march at Magiligan Strand the previous weekend that they would ""see them next week"".  There was also evidence from a priest, father Anthony Mulvey, who has since died, who spoke to a woman on the morning of bloody Sunday.  He urged her not to go to the march, and when she asked him why, he said he was carrying his extra munction oils, which are only used to administer the last rites to the dead or dying."
342,"The plans, which could cost up to £6,000, come at a time when Devon County Council is proposing cuts in jobs and services.  Critics have branded the exercise a waste of money.  The council said the simpler design, featuring a pair of leaves to replace the current coat of arms, would save more than £3,000 a year.  The coat of arms features the Latin motto of seafarer Sir Francis Drake: auxilio divino, which means ""by divine aid"".  But the council said the new logo would reflect its new greener image and also save council tax-payers' money.  Peter Doyle, of the council, said: ""Currently, the council's full-colour crest costs us quite a lot of money to reproduce.  ""By using this new simple logo we can save £3,200 a year.""  But the decision to replace the crest has been branded a money-wasting exercise, especially as the council said in February it was raising council tax by 4.9% because it was facing a £15m shortfall in its budget.  Albert Venison of the Devon Pensioners' Action Forum said: ""It's absolutely incredible that we have these sorts of people who are supposed to be looking after the cares and worries of older people, talking about having a new logo.  ""I can tell you the sort of logo I'd like: one with a picture of two hands being held up in horror, saying: '""What are they going to do next?'.""  The new logo is due to be unveiled in April."
343,"It's a measure of how highly the directors of the British Broadcasting Company rated John Reith that they supported his proposals for a public corporation – even though it meant making themselves redundant in favour of governors on January 1st, 1927. Unfortunately for Reith, those former directors had given him a much freer hand to operate than his new ministerially-appointed board - some even wanted to meet daily. Reith distrusted the new chairman, Lord Clarendon, and called him behind his back 'a silly ass'. He was even more vehement about another governor, Ethel Snowden, wife of Philip Snowden, the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer: ""a truly terrible creature, ignorant, stupid and horrid.""  The feeling was mutual. Mrs Snowden's description of Reith was: ""a man whose overwhelming egoism is as distasteful as his character and ability are overestimated.""  Reith stayed at the helm of the Corporation for another eleven years, but the organisation he had created – and in many ways was still creating – was never the same for him.  ""The Archbishop had on his proper robes… and looked very fine""  Reith was nearly 39 and had been married six years when, in 1928, he and Muriel had a baby boy, Christopher John (they had a daughter Marista four years later).  And it was clear only the best would do for their first-born. Reith immediately decided to put his name down for Eton; and asked his friend the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, to perform the baptism. For a son of a Scottish Manse to ask a Primate of the Church of England to perform the ceremony raised some eyebrows.  A couple of years earlier he had turned down an invitation to become a church elder at St Columba's in London because it was part of the Church of Scotland; he explained he wanted to keep his links with his father's denomination, the even more strictly Protestant United Free Church of Scotland. Now he wanted his son to be baptised into what St Columba's minister reminded him in a letter was 'the Anglican branch of the Catholic Church'. Reith, not for the first time in his life, was impressed by the trappings of British society.  With pleasure he observed after the baptism at Lambeth Palace that 'The Archbishop had on his proper robes with the GCVO ribbon and looked very fine.'  ""I will not read any slower; I am going on announcing""  Reith was no behind-the-scenes administrator.  When it came to historic events, like the General Strike and the 1936 Abdication speech of Edward VIII, Reith himself took to the microphone.  Another occasion was the 1929 election, which was won by Labour's Ramsay MacDonald. Reith had been in contact with the parties beforehand about their election addresses.  'MacDonald was ineffective', he noted, though Prime Minister Baldwin impressed him by asking about the social make-up of the radio audience.  The senior Conservative Neville Chamberlain was more cavalier; and Reith in his memoirs complained he didn't take the power of broadcasting seriously enough:  'Neville Chamberlain on arrival at Savoy Hill said he was going to make a poor show – in fact he did – as he had no time for preparation.  What more important work could he have been doing during the week?'  But Reith's own election performance turned out to be a let-down.  The BBC's election results service had been rehearsed, but during the second bulletin of the evening, Reith announced he would read all the results himself until 1.30am.  He hadn't been doing it long when listeners rang asking for the reader to be clearer and to read slower.  The man with the job of explaining this to his Director General was the announcer Eric Dunstan.  He later recalled: 'I did my best politely to inform him of the position, but all he said was: ""I will not read any slower; I am going on announcing"" and he turned his back on me.'  A furious Dunstan stormed out of the building.  He said afterwards:  'The listening public wants clear and efficient announcing, and this is the announcer's job and no one else's.'  Dunstan was replaced the next day.  ""Under the control of that rare individual who acts according to his spiritual convictions""  Reith's reputation as a hardline religious boss was cemented by events in 1929 involving his chief engineer Peter Eckersley.  Popular perception has it that Reith sacked him for an extra-marital affair.  It wasn't so clear-cut.  Certainly Reith had a religious streak to him; one BBC interviewee in the1920s remembers being asked by the Director-General: 'Do you accept the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ?'  But it was the disapproval of Eckersley's senior engineering colleagues that brought matters to a head.  The 'other woman' was Dorothy Clark, the estranged wife of the BBC's music adviser, Edward Clark. Before their marriage, she seems to have been what is now known as a ""wild-child""; the daughter of affluent parents who became an actress and twice got pregnant while on tour. Eckersley first saw her when she was already separated from Edward and was visiting the BBC's Savoy Hill headquarters.  Once their affair began, it seems Edward had no objections. On one occasion he plotted with Eckersley for both to visit Germany on BBC business and take Dorothy with them.  Later, the chief engineer got bolder, taking Dorothy on a BBC visit to Brussels and regularly being seen with her at Savoy Hill. Colleagues who knew his wife Stella, were outraged.  In January 1929, it was brought to Reith's attention.  Reith acted cautiously.  He first spoke to Eckersley, then invited him and his lover to his flat to explain that Eckersley risked losing his job unless the affair ended.  Reith's wife Muriel broke the news to Stella, who knew nothing about the romance. The governors were consulted.  Ethel Snowden wanted instant dismissal, though the chairman and Reith were more cautious and wanted Eckersley to resign and be reinstated later if his marriage could be patched up.  Reith asked for advice from the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Admiral Byng, who was far more hard-line.  He said a BBC man was like a policeman and never off duty: Eckersley, Byng believed, should be sacked.  But Reith didn't follow the advice. Eckersley promised to end the affair and offered his resignation.  He let Reith decide what to do with it and Reith recommended to the Governors that he should stay. It was a brief respite. In April 1929,  Eckersley ran into Dorothy at a party and decided on the spot to leave his wife. The popular image is of Reith pointing to the door like an Old Testament prophet and condemning Eckersley for straying from the paths of righteousness. In fact, when  the governors accepted the chief engineer's  resignation, they awarded him £1,000 in recognition of his valuable service and kept him on as a consultant for another year.  Eckersley in his memoirs believed Reith, as both a Christian and the head of a national organisation, was entitled to sack him, though he thought a different boss might have been more lenient: ' I happened to come under the control of that rare individual who acts according to his spiritual convictions.'  ""It would have been fun to have had the hammer and sickle flying over Broadcasting House""  During Reith's time, the BBC had three headquarters buildings in London.  It began at Magnet House in Kingsway, with the 2LO studios further down the road in the Strand.  Soon after in 1923, it began moving operations to nearby Savoy Hill.  But as the BBC expanded, it outgrew this too.  Reith seems to have been unimpressed by the new Broadcasting House, which opened in 1932.  He wrote – a decade after he left the Corporation - that he had not been happy with it, and had left the development to others. He thought it was too early for what he called 'a comprehensive headquarters for British broadcasting.'  The BBC flag first flew above the 'prow' of the ship-like BH on May 2, 1932, but when overseas broadcasting dignitaries visited, the flags of their countries would be run up instead.  Impishly Reith wrote:  'To my regret the head of the Russian system never came to London; it would have been fun to have had the hammer and sickle flying over Broadcasting House and hear what some people had to say.'  ""What a miserable lot they are""  Reith's struggles with his Board of Governors continued for years.  The week after Peter Eckersely resigned in 1929, he was surprised how smoothly the governors' meeting went.  Then he found out they had been rushing off to the chairman Lord Clarendon's house for an informal meeting without their Director General.  'What a miserable lot they are, ' he wrote.  He was also annoyed the Governors would lunch at the Savoy without inviting him.  It was a relief when Clarendon was replaced in 1930 and by that time Reith decided he would prefer to be BBC chairman than Director General.  When the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald didn't give it to him, he described himself as disgusted.  He saw MacDonald at a funeral service shortly after and 'I directed a glare of malevolence'.  The new chairman was a former Commons Speaker,  John Henry Whitley who was nervous about working with the fearsome DG.  But the Postmaster General Hastings Lees-Smith told him not to be daunted, telling him Reith wouldn't be long at the BBC ""because he will end up in a lunatic asylum"".  He was wrong, but not wildly so. Reith did receive treatment at the  Psychological Clinic of Glasgow during his break-up with Charlie Bowser a decade earlier; and and in later life received electric shock treatment for depression.  Also, Reith's brother Ernest died in a lunatic asylum.  ""Where does he get his Mussolini traits?""  By the 1930s, Reith had an image problem that never left him.  It was made worse because – in an age of dictators - it was easy to make comparisons.  When Reith took his mother to tea at the House of Commons, the MP Nancy Astor asked if he got his 'Mussolini traits' from her.  During a Commons debate in 1936 on the BBC, the Labour MP George Lansbury said Reith ""would have made a very excellent Hitler for his country."" Another Labour member, Hastings Lees Smith – the former minister who predicted Reith would end up in an asylum – called the BBC 'the nearest thing in this country to Nazi government that can be shown.'  Reith's own comments didn't help.  He said he admired Mussolini and talked in 1939 of Hitler's 'magnificent efficiency'.  He also had a sneaking admiration for the German broadcasters: 'Germany has banned hot jazz and I'm sorry that we should be behind in dealing with this filthy product of modernity.'  ""We are thoroughly disgusted with the false and malignant statements about the Director General""  During the 1930s, Reith fought off attempts to introduce a staff association in the BBC to give employees a bigger say.  One supporter of the idea was  Clement Attlee, later to be Labour's postwar Prime Minister. Attlee suggested that Reith ruled 'a little by fear'. But in a comment that shows his firm belief in managerial hierarchy, Reith denied the charge:  '…unless the awareness and respect which a subordinate should feel of and for his chief is to be called fear – the fear a man should have of not doing as well as he might; of letting himself down; of letting his chief down.'  In 1934 Reith appeared in front of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs.  He expected a rough ride from critics about staff relations, based on newspaper campaigns against him. But when challenged, he passed a letter to the chairman, signed by 800 members of staff that was given to him as he left Broadcasting House for the meeting.  It read:  'The undersigned members of the staff of the BBC, thoroughly disgusted with the false and malignant statements about the director-general being published in certain newspapers, wish to record their detestation of the newspapers concerned, and to reaffirm their loyalty and gratitude to the director-general.'  The committee's critics melted away after that coup de theatre. But then Reith's sense of the dramatic was honed with the BBC's staff amateur dramatic company. The man accused of being aloof from his workforce  regularly appeared in its productions.  His last role was in 1936 playing a butler in a play performed at the Fortune Theatre in London. The Daily Mail reviewer described Reith as 'looking uncommonly like Boris Karloff at his most sinister'.  ""Usually on holiday when significant events in television took place""  Throughout Reith's time at the Corporation, it continued to expand. His determination meant its radio broadcasts spread to the Empire, too. The idea of an Empire Service was well received by politicians, but they could not agree who would pay the costs. It was Reith who took it upon himself – and the British licence payer – to go ahead without them. What became the World Servjce was later described by the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as ""Britain's greatest gift to the world in the 20th century."" On the first day of the Empire Service, in 1932, Reith personally delivered the opening address.  Because of the different time zones, he had to deliver his words live five times over the next 15½ hours.  He was less interested in the development of television.  Anthony Kamm, the biographer of television's inventor, John Logie Baird, says that Reith usually managed to be on holiday when significant events in television took place.  One explanation is his background in the Free Church of Scotland, where the Word was what mattered and church decoration was kept to a minimum  to avoid distractions. The BBC historian A S A Briggs believes Reith saw television as a threat to society: 'he thought it would really corrupt and ruin the nation and you can't go much further than that.'  At the 1937 Coronation of George V Reith declined an invitation to put the BBC in charge of filming. One of his leaving gifts when he left the BBC in 1938 was a television set. He said he would never look at it.  ""Good evening, Reith. Very nice of you to make all these arrangements""  In 1936 the new King Edward VIII renounced the Throne to marry the divorcee Mrs Simpson.  The King wanted to speak to the nation about the affair, but had to wait until the abdication was approved by Parliament.  Reith went personally to Windsor Castle, where engineers had set up a microphone for the 10pm broadcast.  The former King was grateful: 'Good evening, Reith.  Very nice of you to make all these arrangements and to come over yourself.'  Reith made the introduction, calling him 'His Royal Highness the Prince Edward', then slipped out of the chair for the prince to take his place.  As he moved in, Edward kicked the table leg with a bang clearly heard over the microphone.  Listeners thought it was a sign of Reith's disapproval, imagining the moralistic DG had walked out and slammed the door behind him.  Why Reith left the BBC in 1938 is still a mystery, which even he doesn't seem to have understood. He later called his resignation 'a frightful mistake', though his daughter Marista thinks he was trying to cover up the fact that he'd been pushed out. Reith's biographer Ian McIntyre says he wasn't pushed: he jumped.  He'd been announcing for years he wanted to leave.  Indeed as the BBC began a new Charter period in 1937, he offered the Governors his resignation so they could begin this new chapter with a fresh face.  Reith's diaries talk about his constant search for new challenges, though the BBC historian  A S A Briggs says there were challenges enough in the BBC, had he wanted to take them; like developing  television and how to handle mass communication in wartime.  But the facts of his departure are these. He was called to Downing Street early in June 1938 to see the Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's top adviser Sir Horace Wilson. He offered Reith the full-time job as chairman of the struggling government-subsidised Imperial Airways, 'starting tomorrow if possible'.  Reith had already heard his name linked with the job so wasn't surprised, but he insisted on Chamberlain making the job offer personally. His interview with Chamberlain sounds bizarre. Reith didn't fight to keep his BBC job and didn't argue with the Prime Minister. Nor did Chamberlain 'instruct' him to take it.  'He said he wasn't using that word. So I asked if he wanted me to go.  He said again that was maybe too strong but that if I went he would be very glad.'  And that was how, after 18 years in charge of British broadcasting, Reith got a new job. It wasn't an order, he could have refused and he didn't even get a peerage or extra money out of it.  In his memoirs he wrote: 'I said I was getting £10,000 from the BBC and would not require any increase on that.'  ""I resign, I shall resign, I have resigned.  There it is – in all three tenses…""  Reith's had hoped his new job running Imperial Airways would not cut all his links with the BBC and he might be appointed a Governor.  But the chairman, R C Norman, told him that his presence on the board would be unfair on his successor.  The governors also decided he should not help to choose his replacement, who turned out to be Sir Frederick Ogilvie, Vice Chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast.  Reith had wanted an internal appointment, but on the governors' behalf had rung up Ogilvie to see if he was interested.   Reith's view of him: 'a man of fine character and outlook; of personal charm…. I was quite sure he was not the man for the BBC.'  On June 30th, 1938, Reith left Broadcasting House for the last time as DG.  He had asked to go without ceremony and – as he put it – 'one walked out as quietly as one had walked in'.  He carried out one more duty.  Along with his secretary and his deputy Cecil Graves – the man he wanted to replace him – they drove to the BBC transmitter at Droitwich in Worcestershire to switch it off at midnight.  He signed the visitors book: 'J C W Reith – late BBC'.  There was a postscript to this.  A week later, the BBC governors realised Reith had not handed in a written resignation. The chairman had to remind him. In a bitter reply, Reith responded: 'I resign, I shall resign, I have resigned. There it is – in all three tenses…'"
344,"Big Bill liked his drink. So much so it is alleged he sank 10 pints before a snooker match to steady his nerves.  In an era when sport stars wore tight outfits as a result of fashion dictating, Werbeniuk had no choice but to wear tight outfits because his weight fluctuated around 20 stone.  So the combination of being a heavy drinker, vastly overweight and a smoker - yes, he smoked as well - made him a cult figure on the circuit.  But like other vice-ridden players of his time, he was also very good at snooker.  Werbeniuk occupied the world's top 16 for seven out of eight seasons.  The highlight of his career came in 1984 when he reached the final of the Lada Classic - he lost 9-5.  He also reached the quarter-final stage of the World Snooker Championship on four occasions.  The Canadian was a big favourite at The Crucible and always played to the crowd. On one occasion he broke wind at the venue then turned around to ask the audience, ""Who did that?""  But by the late 1980s things took a turn for the worse for the loveable Canadian.  Werbeniuk began to take the drug Inderal on the advice of his doctors to help his alcohol intake.  Unfortunately, the contents of the drug were on the snooker governing body's (WPBSA) banned substances list.  Werbeniuk, though, continued to take the drug and after receiving a number of fines he quit the sport.  In his last professional match in 1990 he said: ""I've had 24 pints of extra strong lager and eight double vodkas and I'm still not drunk.""  Werbeniuk returned to Canada and played a bit of pool before falling on bad times.  A year before his death in January 2003 he was out of work and living on disability benefits.  The big Canadian's passing was mourned by many fans around the world, who had not only lost a popular figure but a great player from snooker's golden age.

346,"Former international goalkeeper Harry Gregg, 75, will never forget that day 50 years ago when so many of his friends, among them the Busby Babes, died on a snow laden runway.  But he might draw some comfort from the thought of those he pulled from the wreckage.  At 1503 GMT on 6 February 1958, the plane carrying the legendary footballers back from Belgrade crashed in a blizzard after re-fuelling at Munich airport.  Gregg found himself hailed as a hero after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors - the goalkeeper's ""greatest ever save"".  Among those he helped was Vera Lukic, the wife of a Yugoslavian diplomat and her daughter, Vesna.  What he did not know was that Vera was pregnant. And in saving her, he also saved her son, Zoran.  Late last year, he returned to Belgrade and met the man who was not even born when Gregg saved his life.  He sat with Vera Lukic and her family and talked about that day and what it meant to all of them.  Zoran told Gregg: ""I have always wanted this moment, to look into your face and say to you, 'thank you'. I was the third passenger you saved, but, at the time, you were not to know that.""  Gregg replied: ""You've nothing to thank me for. I did what had to be done without thinking about it.  ""I've lived with being called a hero but I'm not really a hero. Heroes are people who do brave things knowing the consequences of their actions. That day, I had no idea what I was doing.""  On the anniversary of the crash, what he would like to remember, he said, are the happy moments before the crash changed everything.  ""The fact there's going to be a minute's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people I played with, but one must remember as well, there were other people on board that aircraft, a lot more people.  ""I want the minute's silence to be over and then I want to remember the happy times, that's what I want the world to remember, that's what I want the families to remember.  ""I want to remember fighting for the best tracksuits on the training ground, fighting for the best pair of socks. I want to remember the Arsenal game (united beat Arsenal 5-4 at Highbury in their last game in England before the crash).  ""And I want to remember the happy, free spirits after the final game (against Red Star Belgrade) and the banquet that night.""  Back in his home on the north coast of Ireland, Harry Gregg has pictures on his wall of the crash scene.  Yet they make up only part of what is a vast gallery of shots from his days as a Manchester United player.  And the most prominent pictures on that wall capture a young team, flush with promise, before a glittering future was cruelly snatched away.  ""I don't want my life to remembered for what happened on a runway,"" he said.  ""I don't need the sheriff's badge and I don't want to play the hero.""  He added: ""The wonderful thing to me about that period of time was the freshness of youth and the free spirit, the manner in which we played.  ""I'm not a poet but I always think 'they laughed, they loved, they played the game together, they played the game and gave it every ounce of life and the crowds - they thronged to see such free, young spirits'.  ""To me that what's I want to remember, that was the wonderful thing.""  Re-United is on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday, February 4 at 10.35pm."
347,"By BBC's Humphrey Hawksley in Mali At a run-down police station in Sikasso, a small town in Mali, the files on missing children are endless. The sad truth is that many have been kidnapped and sold into slavery. The going price is about US$30.    I might have got out but there are thousands of children still over there. If by your report, you can help free just one, you would be doing a good job    The local police chief is in no doubt where the children have gone. ""It's definitely slavery over there,"" he said. ""The kids have to work so hard they get sick and some even die."" In all, at least 15,000 children are thought to be over in the neighbouring Ivory Coast, producing cocoa which then goes towards making almost half of the world's chocolate. Many are imprisoned on farms and beaten if they try to escape. Some are under 11 years old. Save the Children Fund has set up a transit centre in the hope that one day these children will come home from the cocoa, coffee and other farms on which they are working. But so far they haven't. The place is empty, although one who managed to escape has a message worth listening to.    Mali's Save the Children Fund director, Salia Kante, has a message for shoppers - think about what you are buying    ""I might have got out,"" said Malick Doumbia, ""but there are thousands of children still over there. If by your report, you can help free just one, you would be doing a good job."" The work of this former slave ended up in shops around the world, as products that often do not specify exactly where they came from. So Mali's Save the Children Fund director, Salia Kante, has a message for shoppers too - think about what you are buying. ""People who are drinking cocoa or coffee are drinking their blood,"" he said. ""It is the blood of young children carrying 6kg of cocoa sacks so heavy that they have wounds all over their shoulders. It's really pitiful to see."" In the market, field worker Ibrahim Haidara asks people what they know about the slave trade. One man replied: ""After one year you don't get money. If you ask for your money, you don't get money and you are beaten."" The slave children are taken from poor areas of Mali - the sons and daughters of street sellers, or the slum kids whose parents sell them for just a few dollars to work as plantation slaves in another country. Yet the multi-nationals who make their living out of selling chocolate and coffee all around the world haven't contributed anything to the campaign here to stop the slavery trade taking place."
348,"There are plans to create England's biggest wetlands on a peninsula in Somerset, rather than rebuild its deteriorating flood defences.  The £20m project would involve letting the sea reclaim the land at Steart Point between the River Parrett and the Severn Estuary.  The Environment Agency will present the plans to the public on Wednesday, following an 18-month consultation.  Bids for funding are being put to the government and other organisations.  Natural England and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge are also involved in the project.  An Environment Agency spokesman said flood defences in the area were coming to the end of their useful life and that it was was ""sparsely populated and mainly farmland"".  The spokesman said: ""One option is to let the land flood to create valuable new wetland habitats which will also help with reducing risk of flooding elsewhere.  ""If it comes off it will be the biggest wetlands creation scheme in the country.""  The planned wetlands area would cover 500 hectares of land.  This, he said, was the preferred option following consultations with residents and experts.  The plans will be on display at Otterhampton Village Hall, Combwich, between 1430 and 1930 BST on Wednesday."
349,"""They had to kill him to prolong the life of apartheid,"" Nelson Mandela has said of Steve Biko.  Biko, a leader of the black consciousness movement in South Africa, died of major head injuries in South African police custody 25 years ago on 12 September 1977.  His contribution to the black fight for freedom from apartheid is often placed as second only to that of former President Nelson Mandela.  The anniversary of his death at the hands of the apartheid government's police is being marked across South Africa but is also the cause of a row over what he means for South Africa today  Steve Biko was never a member of the ANC and was active politically in the late 1960s and 1970s when the ANC was banned.  At the time young black activists moved away from the ANC's stress on non-racial ideology towards one that emphasised black empowerment and consciousness.  The arguments today in South Africa are about whether the ANC has taken on board his ideas and become an heir to his struggle for black rights or whether it is just appropriating his name when it suits them.  ANC supporters and those who claim to be the heirs of black consciousness argue over whether he would have joined the ANC had he lived and whether he would have supported the policies of the ANC government.  Born in the Eastern Cape of South Africa in December 1946, Steve Biko became a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner in the late 1960s while studying medicine.  A member of the non-racial National Union of South African Students, he decided that the union was too dominated by white liberals and founded the black South African Students' Organisation.  This stressed the need for black South Africans to take direct control of their own destinies.  Biko underlined the need for blacks to throw off mental as well as physical oppression but did not take the view that whites had no place in South Africa.  ""No race possesses the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and force, and I wish there is room for all of us in South Africa,"" he wrote then.  But on a pessimistic note he added: ""One wonders if the interests of blacks and whites in this country have not become so mutually exclusive as to remove the possibility of there being room for all of us"".  Steve Biko was viewed with alarm by the South African apartheid government and in 1973 he became a ""banned"" person - being restricted to his home town of King William's Town.  But he continued to work for the consciousness movement - leading to his arrest four times between 1975 and 1977.  The uprising against the white government's discriminatory education system, which started in the Soweto township on 16 June 1976, left hundreds of black people dead across South Africa and was a watershed in the development of internal opposition to the regime.  The student movements which led the protests were strongly influenced by Steve Biko.  His arrest and violent death at the hands of the police brought an abrupt end to his life and political career when he was still just 30 years old.  But it also brought ever greater international condemnation down on the South African Government, especially after the Justice Minister, Jimmy Kruger, said that Biko's death ""left me cold"".  Steve Biko became an icon second only to Nelson Mandela in the struggle against apartheid - recognised around the world as a symbol of resistance and sacrifice.  Internationally, this was emphasised by the Hollywood film, Cry Freedom, based on Biko's life.  After the election of the ANC Government in 1994, the Truth and reconciliation Commission was set up under Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Commission denied an amnesty to five policemen who admitted being involved in his death, though they have never been prosecuted.  In a tribute to him, Nelson Mandela wrote that just before his death, Steve Biko was arranging a secret meeting with ANC leaders and was killed to prevent him joining forces with them.  But the Azanian People's Organisation (Azapo), who still profess his black consciousness views, accuse the ANC of appropriating and corrupting his legacy.  ""Biko was not a neutral, apolitical and mythical icon that today he is scandalously made out to be in order to legitimise a black majority government that is weak,"", Azapo said, according to the French news agency AFP.  The black Sowetan newspaper takes the view that in South Africa today he would have argued that ""more emphasis should be placed on African self-reliance"".  So in South Africa the struggle continues for Steve Biko - but over his memory and legacy rather than against apartheid."
350,"Brady is believed to have sent the letter to Mrs Johnson via a friend The mother of Moors murder victim Keith Bennett has spoken of her shock at receiving a letter from her son's killer Ian Brady. Winnie Johnson, 72, got the two-page letter - dated 21 December 2005 - from the murderer, who is detained at Ashworth hospital near Liverpool. Brady, 68, complained of his treatment at the high-security hospital. Keith Bennett, 12, was murdered by Brady and girlfriend Myra Hindley, and is presumed buried on Saddleworth Moor. Watch the report on the Moors murderer Brady's letter repeated his claim that he is being kept alive by force-feeding for ""political purposes"". Keith Bennett's body has never been found Mrs Johnson, in an interview with Sky News, said: ""It was a shock to me. He knows a lot more than what he is saying. ""He's admitted he can take police to within 20 yards of where he buried Keith, so that man's not insane, and they just ignored him. Why should they ignore a thing like that?"" Mrs Johnson added: ""It's a human life that's gone 41 years ago, and I have had hell since he's been gone."" A spokeswoman for Ashworth Hospital said Brady must have sent the letter to Mrs Johnson via a third party as nobody from the hospital saw it. Patients' incoming and outgoing letters are inspected visually and opened if there is cause for concern. Ian Brady was convicted of the murders of five children ""It might have been passed to a visitor to post on his behalf or it might have been via a letter to a lawyer, MP or independent advocate... the hospital doesn't open these letters as these relationships are regarded as a private one,"" she added. Despite several police searches Keith's remains have never been found. Brady and Hindley's other child victims' bodies have been found, but Brady has said he has been unable to find the patch of scrubland where the youngster was buried. In his letter addressed to ""Dear Mrs Bennett"", Brady said he was ""perfectly rational"". Brady did not refer directly to Keith by name and did not claim he could take investigators directly to the grave but spoke of the ""clarity"" of his recollections. Brady and Hindley were jailed for life in 1966 for murdering five children.     "
351,"Although most of the Bloody Sunday Tribunal evidence was heard in Londonderry, the soldiers who were there on 30 January 1972 appeared in London amid security concerns.  Soldiers who were on the ground at the time of the shootings gave evidence anonymously. They were not granted immunity from prosecution; only immunity from self-incrimination.  Colonel Wilford was directly in charge of the soldiers who went into the Bogside to arrest rioters. It was his job to run a successful operation to round up trouble-makers, protect the public and get his troops back to base unharmed.  But Saville concludes that the soldiers only went into the Bogside because the colonel went further than his orders from Brigadier MacLellan. His superior wanted to avoid running battles that would make it impossible to distinguish between rioters and peaceful marchers.  ""Colonel Wilford either deliberately disobeyed Brigadier MacLellan's order or failed for no good reason to appreciate the clear limits of what he had been authorised to do,"" said Saville.  ""Colonel Wilford decided to send Support Company into the Bogside because at the time he gave the order he had concluded (without informing Brigadier MacLellan) that there was now no prospect of making any, or any significant, arrests in the area he had originally suggested, as the rioting was dying down and people were moving away.  ""In addition it appears to us that he wanted to demonstrate that the way to deal with rioters in Londonderry was not for soldiers to shelter behind barricades like (as he put it) ""Aunt Sallies"" while being stoned, as he perceived the local troops had been doing, but instead to go aggressively after rioters, as he and his soldiers had been doing in Belfast.  ""What Colonel Wilford failed to appreciate, or regarded as of little consequence, was that his soldiers… would almost certainly be unable to identify anyone as a rioter.""  Col Wilford was exonerated by the Widgery tribunal and six months after the event he was awarded the Order of the British Empire by the Queen.  The Saville inquiry found that one soldier, Lance Corporal F killed Patrick Doherty, Michael Kelly, Bernard McGuigan and possibly also William McKinney and James Wray.  The report says: ""Lance Corporal F did not fire in a state of fear or panic. We are sure that he fired either in the belief that no-one in the area into which he fired was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or not caring whether or not anyone there was posing such a threat.""  Other soldiers who definitely killed were R, G, U. In other cases it is too difficult to work out who exactly was responsible.  ""With the exception of Private T [and another soldier in one specific incident], none of the firing by the soldiers of Support Company was aimed at people posing a threat of causing death or serious injury.""  ""We have concluded, for the reasons we give, that apart from Private T many of these soldiers have knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing.""  In early 1972, the general was commander of land forces and increasingly concerned that the army had no control over a large part of Derry. He wanted to see rioters dealt with swifty.  The inquiry learnt of the existence of a memo, written by Sir Robert in January 1972, in which he suggested shooting (but not killing) some of the ringleaders of the rioting, known as the ""Derry Young Hooligans"". In the general's mind the army was ""virtually incapable"" against these gangs, because they operated under the cover of snipers.  Lord Saville's report said the panel were ""surprised"" that the general should have seriously considered such a plan and did not believe it had been adopted.  But the inquiry said he could not be criticised for deploying soldiers to arrest rioters, although he had probably sent the wrong unit.  ""In our view his decision to use 1 PARA as the arrest force is open to criticism, on the ground that 1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists in Londonderry.  ""However, there is to our minds a significant difference between the risk of soldiers using excessive physical violence when dispersing crowds or trying to arrest rioters and the risk that they would use lethal weapons without justification.""  The inquiry concluded the general had no reason to expect the tragedy that then unfolded. It accepted his denial in evidence that he sent 1 Para in to provoke republican gunmen to confront them in the street.  Brigadier MacLellan had the power to launch arrest operations against rioters during the day - and the inquiry accepted that he delayed launching that plan until he believed there was sufficient separation between their targets and the marchers.  Saville concluded he had no reason to believe that lives were at stake if the team led by Colonel Wilford went in. The inquiry said that his proposed arrest operation did not include storming the Bogside.  ""We have concluded that Brigadier MacLellan does not bear any responsibility for the deaths and injuries from the unjustifiable firing by soldiers on Bloody Sunday.""  Saville exonerates Major Ted Loden, the commander in charge of soldiers following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Families said the major could have stopped the soldiers from firing.  The report says that events moved so fast ""after the soldiers disembarked in the Bogside that Major Loden had no idea what was actually going on; he assumed that his soldiers had come under attack from republican paramilitaries and were responding.  ""At the time the casualties were being sustained, Major Loden neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat.""  General Sir Mike Jackson, the former head of the British Army, was a Parachute Regiment captain on the day and the second in command of 1 Para.  In the aftermath of the shootings, he wrote up what became known as the ""Loden List of Engagements"".  This was a brief account of what soldiers had told Major Loden about why they had fired. Sir Mike told the inquiry that the list was simply an operational record of shots fired - not an investigative document. He had simply transcribed what he had been told.  Families said that the document was an attempt to conceal the truth by presenting each victim as a bomber or gunman. The list was referred to by senior officers in press briefings in the hours after the killings.  Saville said that the circumstances under which the list was compiled were ""far from ideal"".  But the report added: ""We accept Captain Jackson's evidence of the purpose for which the list was initially prepared; and find nothing sinister in the fact that it did not include details such as the names of the soldiers and the number of rounds fired.  ""However, the list did play a role in the Army's explanations of what occurred on the day."""
352,"Swarms can devastate crops and cause serious economic hardship It is one of nature's most radical transformations - the moment a crowd of harmless desert locusts begins to swarm into a devastating plague. Now scientists from the UK and Australia say they have discovered the trigger - the brain chemical serotonin. The molecule is best known in humans as a target of anti-depressant drugs. The discovery could lead to new control strategies for the pests, which plague 20% of the world's land, they write in Science journal. Desert locusts are known to swarm by the billions, inflicting severe hardship on farmers in parts of Africa, China and other areas. But the insects actually spend much of their life in a harmless, ""solitary"" phase. To find that serotonin is what causes a normally shy, antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing    When food runs short, they slowly become clustered together and enter their ""gregarious"" phase, culminating in an aggressive swarm. Prior to swarming, the locusts undergo a series of dramatic physical changes - their body colour darkens and their muscles grow stronger. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. To find out the chemical signal that triggers this metamorphosis, scientists from Oxford University, Cambridge University and Sydney University began monitoring locusts in the laboratory. They triggered the gregarious behaviour by tickling the beasts' hind legs, to simulate the jostling they experience in a crowd. They found that locusts behaving the most gregariously (in swarm-mode) had approximately three times more serotonin in their systems than their calm, solitary comrades. ""The question of how locusts transform their behaviour in this way has puzzled scientists for almost 90 years,"" said co-author Dr Michael Anstey, from Oxford University. ""We knew the [physical] stimuli that cause locusts' amazing Jekyll and Hyde-style transformation. Gregarious locusts (L) and solitary (R) were once thought to be different species    ""But nobody had been able to identify the changes in the nervous system that turn antisocial locusts into monstrous swarms. ""Now we finally have the evidence to provide an answer."" The team say their finding opens up a new idea for a locust control strategy - a chemical that inhibits serotonin and thus converts swarming locusts back to their solitary phase. In humans, by contrast, keeping serotonin levels high is the aim of many anti-depressant drugs. ""Serotonin profoundly influences how we humans behave and interact,"" said co-author Dr Swidbert Ott, from Cambridge University. ""So to find that the same chemical is what causes a normally shy, antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing."""

The evergreen pop star released his debut album in 1959 and has produced 47 studio albums, 35 compilations, 11 live albums and seven film soundtracks.  The new release will feature classic rock 'n' roll tracks that were made famous by the likes of Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Buddy Holly.  Sir Cliff, 72, is the only artist to have had at least one UK top five album in each of the last seven decades.  Averaging two albums per year throughout his career, fourteen of his long players have reached number one in the UK, with a further 54 reaching the top 10.

354,"Children's programmes will no longer be shown on BBC One and Two following the digital switchover, the BBC Trust has confirmed.  Award-winning shows such as Horrible Histories and Blue Peter will move permanently to CBBC and CBeebies.  No date has been set for the change, but the final analogue transmitters will be switched off in Northern Ireland between 10-24 October.  The confirmation came in a report approving the BBC's cost-cutting plans.  Spending on children's programmes will not be affected, and the move is unlikely to be detrimental to viewing figures.  In recent months, the number of young people watching children's programmes on the BBC's main terrestrial channels has occasionally dropped as low as 1,000.  Figures on digital have steadily increased since its introduction of CBBC and CBeebies in 2002.  Blue Peter, for example, is now seen by an average audience of 123,000 6-12 year olds when it is shown on CBBC.  BBC One repeats of the show are watched by an average of 30,000 children in the same age range.  A Trust spokesperson said: ""Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere.  ""Only a very small percentage of children still solely watch these programmes on BBC One and BBC Two alone, so moving them to digital channels is merely following current viewing patterns and reflects the fact that CBeebies and CBBC will be universally available on digital TV from the end of this year.""  The BBC Trust document was its final report into cost-saving plans known internally as ""Delivering Quality First"".  It confirmed that cuts to local radio and TV services would be halved - with savings now in the region of £8m, compared to the original proposal of £15m.  As a result, reductions in local news teams will be lower, and coverage of local sport will be ""more protected"", the Trust said.  A plan for local radio stations to share programmes in the afternoon will now be limited to a ""very small number"" of stations.  However, on weekday evenings between 19:00 and 22:00, all of the BBC's regional stations in England will join together for a new all-England programme, although stations will have the flexibility to opt for local sports coverage.  Across the BBC, some of the main points noted by the BBC Trust were:  The BBC Trust, which is the governing body of the BBC, drew up its report in consultation with listeners, viewers and other broadcasters.  BBC management responded to the report, saying: ""We welcome the BBC Trust's full approval of our Delivering Quality First proposals.  ""The coming years will involve a significant effort from people at every level of the BBC to deliver the savings while we continue to provide the quality programmes and services that audiences expect from us."""

""2012 will be the year of a new era of MotoGP,"" FIM president Vito Ippolito told the motogp.com website.  ""Manufacturers want 1000cc engines, so that's the way now.""

357,"Corporal John Gregory, 30, from Catterick, North Yorkshire, fired an SA80 rifle up to 10 times at Sergeant Robert Busuttil, 30, from Swansea, at a barbeque in Afghanistan.  The incident occurred while both men were on peacekeeping duties in Kabul last August.  Wiltshire coroner David Masters recorded verdicts of unlawful killing on the death of Sergeant Busuttil and suicide on Corporal Gregory.  Mr Masters, speaking at Chippenham Magistrates Court, called on the Army to tighten its rules on alcohol and gun security.  ""It has been said that alcohol and lethal, loaded weapons as a lethal cocktail just do not mix,"" he said.  ""This incident may be a one-off but my concern is to prevent it from becoming a two-off, a three-off or more.""  The three-day inquest had heard how the two men had fought at the party, shortly before Corporal Gregory returned with his loaded gun.  The court was told Corporal Gregory was two-and-a-half times over the drink drive limit, despite orders rationing beer to just two small cans a day.  On Tuesday, his widow Annette blamed his actions on anti-malaria medication, saying the drugs had affected his moods.  She denied claims from other soldiers that her husband had been aggressive and could get ""punchy"" when drunk.  Recalling the horrific events of 16 August, Mrs Gregory said: ""What happened just wasn't John. He would never do anything so completely rash and irresponsible.  ""I think the anti-malaria tablets could have been a factor here - there is no other way to explain it.""  Referring to the drugs, pharmacologist Colonel Graham Stewart, of the Royal Army Medical Corps, said: ""Chloroquine can rarely cause psychotic effects in individuals but this is not fully understood.  ""I estimate it to be a one in 500,000 chance,"" he said. ""It is much more likely that Corporal Gregory's psychotic episode was the result of the direct ingestion of alcohol.""  The inquest heard how soldiers in Kabul - and especially the 12 stationed with the bulk fuel installation at Bagram Airport - often flouted the so-called ""two can"" drinks rule.  A weapons expert was critical about unit policies which allowed soldiers to have easy access to their loaded rifles whilst being able to drink.  Captain Andrew Riddell, of the Small Arms School Corps, based near Brecon, south Wales, said: ""This was a very unusual situation. Mixing alcohol with loaded weapons is a lethal cocktail."""
358,"It's been billed as the battle of aristocracy versus meritocracy; nobility against social mobility; the privileged as opposed to the talented.  Prince Charles' opinions on ""the learning culture in schools"", perceived by some to be an outdated defence of the class system, provoked a backlash in many corners.  The prince's supporters hit back, citing Charles' work for his Prince's Trust charity, which seeks to widen opportunity for young people. In uncharacteristically reactive mood, Charles himself publicly waded into the controversy - clarifying his thoughts in a speech on Monday night.  ""In my view, it is just as great an achievement to be a plumber or a bricklayer as it is to be a lawyer or a doctor,"" said the prince.  Yet the passions excited on both sides are a telling reminder that even in 21st Century Britain one only has to scratch the veneer of a ""fair society"" to expose the seething prejudices and conflicting beliefs underneath. These days, the question is not do we want to live in a fair society, but what definition of fairness should we be aiming for.  It was not always thus. The historic English class system is known the world over for its rigid social stratification - the idea of knowing one's station, and not rising above it, which Prince Charles vehemently distanced himself from in his recent retort.  Victorian free-marketeers believed efficient markets were stultified by the old order as jobs and wealth were passed down through families, rather than being open to ambitious individuals.  Nicholas Abercrombie, co-author of the Penguin Dictionary of Sociology, sees the 1870 Education Act, which introduced state funded schooling, as a key step in the drive towards greater social mobility. Beforehand, education was largely private; a preserve of the wealthy.  Sociologist Laurie Taylor puts his marker down at roughly the same time, noting the introduction of competitive exams for jobs in the civil service as a milestone on the road to meritocracy in Britain.  ""The civil service exams are the turning point. But the papers were very classical, very Oxbridge orientated,"" notes Mr Taylor.  And, in a sense, this is where the issue has stalled. When Michael Young, later the Labour peer Lord Young, coined the term ""meritocracy"" in the title of his 1958 book The Rise of the Meritocracy, he meant it as a negative term.  Ironic then that while Prince Charles' recent comments were widely portrayed in the media as anti-meritocratic, the late Lord Young's son, journalist Toby Young, sees his words as a vindication of that very doctrine.  ""My father certainly would have been opposed to what Prince Charles was advocating and probably would have described it as meritocratic,"" says Toby Young.  It was Lord Young's ideas that inspired the shake up of secondary education in the 1960s, leading to the rise of comprehensive schools - where children of all abilities and backgrounds are brought together under one roof.  Yet while the political argument about meritocracy remains deadlocked - Tories and Labour both subscribing to the word, but with crucial differences in how they define it - social mobility, the product of meritocracy, surged forward during Prince Charles' lifetime.  The post war boom in so-called professional managerial jobs has propelled millions from working class origins to middle class aspirations.  ""When there were distinctive sets of occupation in which people would take exams and rise though the system, a meritocracy was much clearer,"" he says.  ""The growth in jobs such as PR, advertising and consultancy have gone back to the nepotic world where it's all about who you know, not what you know. Networking has come to be an extremely important way of securing admission.""  But for those who tried and failed in a world where all things are equal, the shift to an anti-meritocratic world has its advantages, says Taylor.  ""The hideous thing about meritocracy is it tells you that if you've given life your all and haven't got to the top you're thick or stupid. Previously, at least, you could always just blame the class system."""
359,"European regulators have paved the way for the takeover of Railtrack by Network Rail, almost a year after the railway network was forced into administration.  The European Commission has approved the sale of Railtrack's stake in the Channel Tunnel rail link to London & Continental Railways, a state-backed consortium.  The move marks the first stage in the insolvent railway company's exit from privatisation after six years as a publicly listed company.  The government said the next step was to apply to the High Court to have Railtrack's operations handed over to Network Rail by early October.  Transport secretary Alistair Darling said the EU clearance meant ""we are one step closer to new ownership of Britain's rail network and all the benefits that a better management structure will bring"".  The Commission approved a state aid application to buy Railtrack's share of the first stage in the high-speed Channel Tunnel rail link.  The state-backed London & Continental Railways consortium is paying £295m for the asset.  Network Rail has already entered into a separate £80m agreement with L&CR for the right to operate and maintain the link and to manage the St Pancras station in London.  Network Rail said the EU's agreement over Channel Tunnel rail link asset did not relate directly to its plans to buy Railtrack.  But Network Rail said: ""It does satisfy a significant outstanding condition contained in the circular to Railtrack Group shareholders, which treats the two transactions as inter-conditional"".  Railtrack shareholders approved Network Rail's £500m takeover of Railtrack in July 2002, after the company was forced into administration in October 2001."
360,"American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the US military headquarters, killing 184 people, after it was hijacked as part of an al-Qaeda plot.  The release of the video, taken from a Pentagon security camera, comes after a Freedom of Information Act request by legal watchdog Judicial Watch.  The group said it hoped to dispel conspiracy theories about the crash.  ""Finally, we hope that this video will put to rest the conspiracy theories involving American Airlines Flight 77,"" president Tom Fitton said.  Some theorists have suggested the aircraft was shot down in flight, and that the Pentagon was struck by a missile.  Stills released in 2002 showed the moment the hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon, killing 125 people in the building and 59 passengers and crew.  The crash came shortly after two other hijacked airlines were flown into the twin towers at the World Trade Center in New York.  Judicial Watch filed the freedom of information request in 2004, but the Pentagon refused to release the video because it was part of the investigation involving al-Qaeda plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, the group said.  This February the group sued the government over its refusal, saying there was ""no legal basis"" for it.  Washington agreed to release the video after a court sentenced Moussaoui to life in jail for his role in 9/11 earlier this month, a Judicial Watch spokeswoman told the BBC.  The group said it fought to obtain the video because ""it was very important to complete the public record"" on the attacks.  French author Thierry Meyssan alleged that Flight 77 did not crash into the Pentagon and suggested a truck bomb or missile caused the damage.  Such views are challenged by witness testimony at the scene of an aircraft fitting the description of Flight 77 crashing into the site.  Correspondents say the release of the video is not unhelpful to the Bush administration.  The footage serves as a graphic reminder of why the US launched its global ""war on terror"" and is still fighting it, the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says."
361,"The prince has played polo for 40 years, but only in charity matches since 1992.  A spokesman from Clarence House said the prince had recently decided it was the right time to retire ""gracefully, but regretfully"".  Prior to 1992, the prince played for competitive teams, and has raised more than £12m while playing in charity matches since.  The prince, who celebrated his 57th birthday on Monday, broke his right arm badly in a fall during a polo match in 1990, which required lengthy treatment.  He suffered a fall again in a charity match in 2001 when he fell awkwardly from his horse and fell briefly unconscious, but was not injured.  The prince also fell from his horse earlier this year.  The Prince of Wales has passed his enthusiasm for the sport to his sons William and Harry, who are both known to be keen players.  And one of the most significant events of his life, meeting now-wife Camilla, happened at a polo match when he was 23.  An often-printed image of the pair shows them in front of a tree in conversation with the prince still in his polo outfit."
362,"Angela Smith is one of the most famous names in British squash, and she was a top-ranked player for over two decades.  She’s won titles across the world for both herself and Great Britain – in fact she only ever lost twice while on international duty.  Angela was the first female player to turn professional, doing so at the age of 24.  By turning pro, she forced Great Britain to allow her to play for her country which previously only let amateurs play.  She was also one of the forerunners of the professional body WISPA, which governs the sport today.  She even remembers the day when Sir Stanley Matthews returned to the club in 1961.  And just as the city's supported her, she supports Stoke-on-Trent and sees it as the centre of her universe although she's coached right across the globe.  Even her school friends would say the former Number 1 was competitive playing at home: Angela often told her doubles partner to serve and then leave the court so she could get on with playing!  To hear more about Angela's career and her love for Stoke City, listen to the interview she gave in 2008 to BBC Radio Stoke's Matt Sandoz.  In this 30 minute interview, Angela reveals, among other things, her highs and lows in the game - and even the surprising fact that, although she's been British and World Champion, she thinks being named the BBC's Regional Sport Personality of the Year is the highlight of her career!"
363,"Demolition work has begun at Heathrow Airport's Terminal 2 as part of a £1bn redevelopment.  Terminal 2, originally named Europa Building, was the west London airport's first terminal building when it opened in 1955.  The terminal, which handled eight million passengers each year, was closed to the public in 2009.  A new building will cater to 20 million passengers when it opens in 2013, airport operator BBA said.  The new terminal will be home to Star Alliance airlines.  By 2019 the new terminal will extend into the current Terminal 1 site to give a joint capacity of 30 million passengers.  Colin Matthews, chief executive of BAA, said: ""Heathrow is changing for the better, and there is much still to do.  ""Our brand new Terminal 2 will offer a better service to airlines and millions of passengers.""  Last September demolition work began on the airport's Queens Building, which housed offices of the airline companies.  Terminal 2 was built at a cost of £21m and designed by architect Frederick Gibberd, who also designed the old control tower, Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral and London Central Mosque.  The first non-stop flight from Heathrow to California took off from the 49,654 sqm terminal in 1957 and the building served as a port for long-haul flights for a time.  But after Terminal 3, also known as Oceanic Building, opened in 1961 long-haul flight operations moved there, leaving Terminal 2 to cater to short-haul flights.  In 1977 the terminal was connected to the London Underground network."
364,"A historic mill, which is part of Derbyshire's World Heritage Site, has been badly damaged in a fire.  Crews were called to the empty 18th Century Bath Street Mill in Derby after smoke was seen coming from inside.  At its height more than 30 firefighters were helping to tackle the blaze and roads in the area were closed.  There area no reports of any injuries and crews said that as soon as they can enter the building, an investigation would begin.  The Derwent Valley Mills, which stretch for 15 miles along the river, became a World Heritage Site in 2001 in recognition of their role in the Industrial Revolution."
365,"Some 136 passengers were evacuated after January's crash-landing The BA plane that crashed at Heathrow in January was probably brought down by ice in its fuel system, an accident report says. The pilots of the Boeing 777 managed to land so that the 136 passengers and 16 crew escaped without serious injury. The Air Accident Investigation Branch believes the flow of fuel dropped causing the engines to lose power less than a minute before touchdown. But investigators say they still do not know how the ice could have formed. Water is naturally present in aviation fuel and the investigators believe there may have been as much as five litres within this aircraft's fuel load. But the report says levels of water found in fuel recovered after the 17 January crash were very low for a Boeing 777. They dismissed the suggestion that the fuel itself froze or became ""waxy"" as icing occurred. The report says the plane flew through unusually cold air over Siberia while en route from Beijing to Heathrow. Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader The fuel temperature fell to -34C (-29F). But jet fuel should not freeze until it is at less than -57C (-70F), and the report says the temperatures involved were not ""unique"". The investigation into the crash of flight BA38 continues with testing at Rolls-Royce in Derby, and Seattle in the US, the home of Boeing. Following Thursday's report, a spokesman for the US Federal Aviation Administration said it would be issuing an air-worthiness directive to US carriers operating Boeing 777 aircraft. This was likely to be about ""changes in procedures for pilots to follow in certain cold weather conditions"" as well as ""changes in certain fuel procedures on the ground"", he said. While it would not be an emergency directive, it was likely to be issued within 24 hours and would have immediate effect. Water in aviation fuel can be dissolved at the molecular level, or simply float as free water, suspended in the fuel. As the fuel gets colder tiny droplets can form and freeze. The mystery facing investigators is why this might have happened on an apparently fully functioning aircraft. Water in the fuel is controlled by draining it regularly out of the fuel tanks - and on the Boeing 777 a so-called ""scavenge system"" pumps it out. Ice can form when the fuel temperature drops to around -1C (30.2F) to -3C (26.6F) Generally the ice crystals simply float and drift in the fuel without causing harm. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Only when the temperature falls further does the ice stick together. Within the fuel system a heat exchanger is used to increase the fuel temperature, but it is possible the blockage might have occurred before this point. The investigation team have built a test rig and introduced pre-prepared ice into the fuel system to see if it would clog up. But the amounts they had to put in to make this happen were far greater than is normal. Despite that, the scenarios being considered by the AAIB are based on the idea that the ice formed gradually in the system and was released as the plane prepared for landing. But the report makes three safety recommendations: that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency introduce interim measures to reduce the risk of ice forming on the Boeing 777 powered by Trent 800 engines the agencies should consider the implications for other aircraft types review the requirements for new engines This accident remains an enormous challenge for the investigation team. But their report stresses the rarity of this crash. It said: ""The accident flight was unique in that this has been the only recorded case of a restricted fuel flow affecting the engine performance to the extent of causing HP pump cavitation"" - the damage found within the pumps that alerted the investigators to the loss of fuel pressure. The report goes on: ""This is the first such event in 6.5 million flight hours and places the probability of the failure as being 'remote'."" In response to the recommendations, the European Aviation Safety Agency said it had agreed with the FAA to ""interim measures"" for ""mandatory aircraft level action"", but gave no further details. It also said it would examine the other recommendations. An FAA spokesman said it was still studying the report but felt the initial review indicated that the issue appeared to affect only Boeing aircraft with Rolls-Royce Trent engines. He understood that Boeing was carrying out tests to establish whether other aircraft with other engine combinations could similarly be affected. He emphasised that shorter-haul aircraft such as Boeing 737s would not be part of the directive as icing was a problem that affected only long-haul journeys. Flight BA 38 from Beijing was extensively damaged when it touched down on 17 January, landing short of the runway but staying largely intact. One person suffered a broken leg and others received minor injuries during the emergency evacuation. 4 Pilots take action to try to overcome problem 5 Aircraft crashes, bounces and slides before halting near start of runway   "
366,"Francis Aungier Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford - universally known as Frank - was a member of that exclusive band of people, the mere mention of whose name provokes visceral debate.  To the popular press he was ""Lord Porn"" or ""Lord Wrongford"". He was caricatured as both a reactionary, who sought to undermine freedom of speech by banning pornography, or as a misguided and dangerous liberal, set upon flooding the UK with newly freed mass murderers and rapists.  Others - like Peter Stanford who wrote Longford's biography, The Outcast's Outcast - take a different view.  The urge for transformation was seemingly hard-wired into Lord Longford's being. Originally a Conservative, he became a socialist.  A member of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, whose family title went back to the 17th Century, he later proved to be a committed Irish nationalist and was considered a class traitor by many of his fellow aristocrats.  And the man who was by birth a Protestant spent most of his life as a devout and practically minded Roman Catholic.  Born in 1905, Lord Longford took a double First at Oxford before becoming an Oxford don.  After having a nervous breakdown while in the Army during World War II, he served as the lead assistant to Sir William Beveridge, the creator of the framework for the modern welfare state.  Even then he courted controversy. As Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Longford had responsibility for post-war Germany.  His decision to ""forgive"" the German people, went down badly with his ministerial colleagues.  Even so, Longford enjoyed a close relationship with the West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who called him ""the founder of modern Germany"". He went on to serve in a number of ministerial posts up to 1968.  Though he was chairman of the National Bank - a large Irish financial institution - and was effective in loosening the Republic's dependence on the City of London, there were times when Lord Longford's idealism could be seen as other-worldly.  For instance, his commission into pornography - inspired by Mary Whitehouse's campaign to ""clean up"" the British media. Lord Longford formed his own committee of the great and good, which visited sex clubs in Denmark in a quest for greater understanding.  One member of the commission was broadcaster Gyles Brandreth. ""At the time the proceedings of the committee - and the media circus that surrounded its activities - were indeed ludicrous,"" he says.  ""But, 30 years on, it's intriguing to find that most people would agree with the thrust of what Lord Longford was saying. His line was that pornography was degrading - to its users and to those who worked in the trade, especially women.""  ""We would pass enormous lurid breasts hanging out of doorways and he wouldn't even notice,"" he says.  ""I felt we could probably have run into a naked woman in the street and he wouldn't have noticed.""  But it was his campaign to free Hindley which still most divides opinion on Lord Longford.  He first met her in May 1969, four years after she and Ian Brady were jailed for life for murdering three children. She would later admit two more killings.  The man whose 1963 report had paved the way for the parole system fervently believed that Hindley - just one among numerous prisoners befriended by Longford over the years - would be a prime candidate for early release.  ""He knew what he was talking about,"" says Mr Stanford. ""He set the system up.""  For more than 30 years he consistently put his reputation on the line in an attempt to convince successive governments and the public, that Hindley was a reformed and remorseful character. He described Brady as ""bonkers"".  The two became close and, until recently, it was believed that Hindley saw Lord Longford as her best chance of freedom.  In the end Hindley, who died in prison in November 2002, distanced herself from the peer, relying increasingly on others to speak out on her behalf.  Seen in this light, Lord Longford - who died 15 months before Hindley - might appear to be the dupe of a calculating and highly intelligent woman. But this would to be to under-estimate both the complexity and certainty of his beliefs.  Jim Broadbent, who portrays him in the Channel 4 film, says: ""His moral certainty was attractive and frustrating.""  To Gyles Brandreth, he was ""a man with enormous heart - human, human. I was grateful to know the man"".  For Peter Stanford, it is Lord Longford's belief in forgiveness and redemption which lies at the heart of his hugely relevant message.  ""Redemption is something we, as a society, are very bad at,"" he says. ""Eight-out-of-10 juvenile prisoners currently re-offend, and seven-out-of-10 over-21s do the same.  ""Lord Longford's argument for a different, more compassionate, approach, to prison is more important than ever."""
367,"Of those questioned, 40% said Mr Clarke would make the best leader, compared with 10% for David Davis and 4% for David Cameron and Malcolm Rifkind.  The poll suggests 20% of people would be more likely to vote Tory with Mr Clarke as leader, and 8% less likely.  ICM interviewed 1,007 adults at random by telephone between 2 and 4 September.  David Davis could lose the party more votes than he could gain, the poll suggests.  Seven per cent of those questioned by ICM Research said they would be more likely to vote for a Davis-led Conservative Party - but 10% would be less likely.  Welcoming the poll, Mr Clarke said: ""It is nice to know that such a wide section of the public hold me in such high regard and have confidence in me.  ""The poll shows that under my leadership, the Conservative Party would have the prospect of winning the next election.""  But supporters of Mr Cameron, the youngest of the candidates, say Mr Clarke's strong showing was down to ""recognition factor"".  Andrew Robothan MP told BBC Two's Newsnight: ""I think it would be surprising if the Conservative Party would go into a general election in 2009 with somebody who was first a minister for Edward Heath in 1972 - 37 years before.  ""We need to appeal to younger people who have not voted Conservative, not people of my age, 54, who already vote predominantly Conservative.""  Stephen Dorrell MP said it was ""an extraordinary tribute"" that Mr Clarke could still ""connect directly with people other Conservatives have failed to connect with"".  There is speculation an attempt to give MPs the final say in the choice of new leader may be rejected later this month.  The election would then take place under the current rules, which give all Tory members a vote.  That could delay the election result until later in January. Grass roots members voted for Iain Duncan Smith over Mr Clarke in 2001 - although the former chancellor says he can win their support this time.  Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.  Liam Fox was the favourite of only 3% of those questioned and David Willetts of only 2%.  And 4% of people said they thought none of the six named candidates would be best, with another 33% undecided.  Mr Clarke's support appears weakest in the 18-24 age group - where 23% said they thought he would make the best leader. But he was favourite among half of those aged above 55.  Mr Cameron had his best showing (8%) in this age group.  Only Mr Clarke and Sir Malcolm Rifkind have publicly declared they will contest the leadership, although Dr Fox is expected join the race later this week.  Sir Malcolm will try to boost his campaign on Tuesday when he begins a tour of Britain in Derbyshire.  He says there must be no ""no go areas"" for the party and is visiting activists in marginal constituencies and areas where there are few or no Tory MPs.  The former foreign secretary said: ""Consultation between MPs and party activists is vitally important all year round. Activists are the lifeblood of our party...  ""Our plans for rebuilding the party must be focused on how we can win back support in those areas of Britain where Conservative support has declined."""
368,"She set up her forum for the people, the first of its kind since Shakespeare, in defiance of establishment-supported theatre.  With her long-time love Gerry Raffles, Littlewood settled her workshop at Stratford, East London, as a ""place where people could act happily"".  Raffles dealt with all the administration of the Theatre Royal productions, leaving Littlewood free to express her creative spirit. Out went fussy sets, footlights, stage make-up and ham acting.  The creator of Look Back in Anger, John Osborne, called his characters soft in comparison with hers. Richard Harris, Brian Murphy and Barbara Windsor all flourished under Littlewood's guidance.  Radical and outspoken, she was feared by the authorities and snubbed by the Arts Council. She was spurned by the BBC and refused entry to a radio studio where she was due to record a play.  It seemed she was ahead of her time. Fifty years later, the same corporation serialised her memoirs, and brought to radio for the first time Littlewood's most celebrated creation, Oh What a Lovely War.  This play came about after a conventional play about World War I was dramatically altered in 1963, when Littlewood decided that ""war is for clowns"".  With her incomprehensible sergeant-major's drill and Frenchmen walking into battle ""baa-ing like lambs to the slaughter"", Littlewood combined slapstick humour with serious satire to set a new style in improvised theatre.  But the company was scuppered by its own success. Over the next decade, its actors were poached for television, and when Gerry Raffles died suddenly in 1975, Littlewood's life took on the aspect of one of her own dramatic creations.  Grief stricken and dismayed by the decline in quality of her ensemble, she closed the door on her Theatre Workshop.  In 1975, she left the theatre forever and moved abroad. A woman of extremes, Littlewood shared her time between a tiny flat in southern France, the vineyards of Bordeaux and a convent, where she steadfastly withstood any religious conversion.  In this environment of self-induced poverty, she was found and befriended by Baron Philippe de Rothschild. His long-time platonic consort, Littlewood lived at times in his Chateau Mouton Rothschild, which she always called ""a stable, converted in the 18th century"".  When Playboy magazine came to interview the Baron, Littlewood arrived at the dinner table dressed as a rabbit, complete with pompom attached.  This very individual self-creation had dragged herself from the poverty of South London to RADA on a scholarship. But she soon left, walked to Manchester and entered repertory theatre there.  Neither of her parents could read or write, and she was a self-professed ""vulgar woman of the people"".  In 1998, the only caveat Littlewood imposed on a young company's revival of Oh What a Lovely War, was that it wasn't staged at the National, that ""elitist and middle class anathema"".  She attacked everyone in the industry, and was freshly incensed in her eighties by the BBC's staging of Oh What a Lovely War as a radio piece, saying it was a visual event.  One of her most derided colleagues was her former assistant Philip Hedley. He once remarked: ""To know Joan is to be attacked by Joan, but the fact is she is a wonder. A ragamuffin, a nuisance, but a wonder."""
369,"Mobiles and the net are hugely popular among young Iranians As protests continue in Iran, details are emerging of the technology used to monitor its citizens. Iran is well known for filtering the net, but the government has moved to do the same for mobile phones. Nokia Siemens Network has confirmed it supplied Iran with the technology needed to monitor, control, and read local telephone calls. It told the BBC that it sold a product called the Monitoring Centre to Iran Telecom in the second half of 2008. Nokia Siemens, a joint venture between the Finnish and German companies, supplied the system to Iran through its Intelligent Solutions business, which was sold in March 2009 to Perusa Partners Fund 1LP, a German investment firm. The product allows authorities to monitor any communications across a network, including voice calls, text messaging, instant messages, and web traffic. But Nokia Siemens says the product is only being used, in Iran, for the monitoring of local telephone calls on fixed and mobile lines. Rather than just block traffic, it is understood that the monitoring system can also interrogate data to see what information is being passed back and forth. A spokesman described the system as ""a standard architecture that the world's governments use for lawful intercept"". [Iran] is also struggling to compete with an opposition that call on the skills of one of the world's most vibrant blogging communities and plenty of tech-savvy folks.    He added: ""Western governments, including the UK, don't allow you to build networks without having this functionality."" Asked by the BBC about the firm's attitude to doing business in Iran, Nokia Siemens said: ""We do have a choice about doing business there, and on balance providing connectivity means there is a net benefit."" He explained that millions of Iranians were getting mobile phone services through Nokia. ""The amount of information that is coming out of Iran from ordinary users because they have connectivity that they would not have had before is of a net benefit to them."" ""I don't think Iran would have expanded its mobile network and its connectivity to its citizens if it had not had this capability."" Nokia Siemens markets the Monitoring Centre product to 150 countries around the world where it does business. The firm says it does not supply the system to China or to Burma. The phone monitoring system sits side-by-side with the extensive net filtering system Iran has constructed in recent years. Traffic in and out of Iran is largely controlled by Iran Telecom. On 13 June, the day after presidential elections, data traffic come to an almost complete halt, according to analysis by network security firm Arbor Networks. Since then, traffic has gradually recovered, and analysts have speculated that the slowdown and re-start was caused by authorities putting in place filtering and monitoring systems. Because Iran is effectively reading every message, this results in an inevitable slow down of traffic. In mid-June, the OpenNet Initiative, which surveys net-watching efforts, updated its survey of net use in Iran and said the nation was: ""investing in improving its technical capacity to extensively monitor the behavior of its citizens on the internet."" It said women's rights activists arrested in the nation had been shown transcripts of instant messages they had sent. ""If true,"" said the survey, the evidence, ""would support the existence of an advanced surveillance program.""     "
370,"All 118 people on board a flight from London Heathrow to Brussels have died when the airliner crashed minutes after take-off.  The British European Airways plane came down in a field in Staines, missing the town centre by just a few hundred yards. It is the worst disaster in British aviation history.  The Trident jet - which had been involved in another accident in 1968 - left Heathrow at 1708 BST and was only three miles (4.8 km) from the airport when witnesses said it ""dropped out of the sky"".  The airline said it did not know what had caused flight BE548 to crash, but BEA chairman Henry Marking told reporters there was ""no reason"" to suspect sabotage.  Witnesses said the three-engined plane broke into two as it fell - the fuselage ploughed into trees bordering a reservoir and the tail section landed 50 yards (45.7 m) away. ""I heard the plane circling overhead and there was a spluttering sound as though the engines were cutting out - then there was a thud like a clap of thunder,"" said 15-year-old Adrian Bailey. Rescuers pulled two people alive from the wreckage of the airliner - a young girl, who died at the scene, and a Dublin businessman who was taken to a local hospital where he died a few hours later. Heathrow airport Catholic chaplain Father Peter Knott reached the site of the crash within 10 minutes and said it was a scene of total devastation. ""There was chaos inside the aircraft - it looked as if everybody had been killed instantaneously,"" he said."
371,"New runways at Heathrow and Gatwick are among the options that have been short-listed by the Airports Commission for expanding UK airport capacity.  The three short-listed options include adding a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow, and a new runway at Gatwick.  The commission, led by businessman Sir Howard Davies, will also consider a new airport in the Isle of Grain in north Kent.  The commission has not shortlisted proposals for expanding Stansted or Birmingham, but said there was likely to be a case for considering them as ""potential options"" for any second new runway by 2050.  Sir Howard was asked in 2012 to investigate the options for expanding the UK's aviation capacity and try to come up with a plan.  He said the Commission's analysis showed one net additional runway was needed by 2030.  ""The capacity challenge is not yet critical, but it will become so if no action is taken soon,"" he added.  There are four interesting elements of today's report. It hasn't written off the ambitious, expensive idea of building a new mega-airport on the other side of London in the Thames Estuary. It misses off Stansted, despite it being picked for expansion by the last government. Stansted lost a lot of passengers in the recession. It also suggests that we might not need one huge hub airport after all, because all the growth in recent years has come from low-cost carriers. In a nutshell, it makes the case stronger for a bigger Gatwick. When I first took over the transport job, about two years ago, the government told me straight away that it would not expand Heathrow. One of the first things the coalition did when it came to power was to cancel Labour plans for a third runway at the airport. I've gone through my old notebooks and found this phrase written down, ""dead and buried"". But after a great deal of lobbying from the airport's owners, other business leaders, airlines and the unions, as well as support from the Transport Select Committee, Heathrow is emerging once again, as a front-runner in the fight to get a new runway. Sir Howard has set a deadline of 2030. But believe me, there are plenty in the industry - like Willie Walsh at British Airways, for example - who still don't think that in the end, anything will actually ever get built.  The Commission has short-listed the following proposals to investigate ahead of its final report:  The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has said that putting a new runway at Heathrow would be a ""catastrophe"".  Following the commission's report, Mr Johnson said he continued to support the creation of the Isle of Grain airport in north Kent.  ""A new airport in the inner estuary is the only credible hub option left. By keeping it on the table, Davies is saying you have a choice - between a damaging U-turn or a radical new vision for expansion,"" he said.  In its report, the Commission calculates an Isle of Grain airport would cost up to £112bn - around five times that of its three short-listed options.  However, it said it would look at it in the first half of 2014, to reach a view on whether the option offered ""a credible proposal"".  ""The overall balance of economic impacts would be uncertain - particularly as an Estuary airport would require the closure of Heathrow for commercial reasons and London City for airspace reasons,"" it says.  Meanwhile, supporters of Heathrow's expansion say it will be quicker and cheaper than other options and will help to maintain the UK as an international aviation hub.  Heathrow's owners submitted evidence to the commission arguing that a new runway could be in place by 2029, allowing 260,000 more flights.  Colin Matthews, Heathrow chief executive, told the BBC: ""The case for Heathrow is strong. It's important that businesses can get around the globe to where economies are growing.  ""We've got Paris and Amsterdam, Frankfurt desperately trying to eat our lunch, they want to have the business that the UK benefits from today.""  John Cridland, head of business lobby group the CBI, said that urgent action was needed from the government when the commission's final recommendations were made in 2015.  ""It is no longer acceptable to bury our heads in the sand on this,"" he added.  Heathrow is one of the world's busiest hub airports, handling 70 million passengers in 2012.  But the airport operates at 98% of its capacity.  When the coalition government came to power in 2010, it scrapped the former Labour government's plan for a third runway at Heathrow.  The government said on Monday that it had not ruled out any options when it came to airport expansion in the south-east of England.  On Sunday, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said that the government would stick to its pledge not to build a new runway at Heathrow before 2015.  He told the BBC: ""We will not be building a third runway in this Parliament. We will stick by our manifesto commitment."""
372,"The Mersey - once the most polluted river in Europe - can support fish throughout its estuary for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, scientists have discovered.  It now has sufficient oxygen in it to support life, following a 20-year clean-up costing £1bn.  Scientists have recorded oxygen levels of well over 60%, compared to the late 1970s when tests found none at all in many areas.  Fish need oxygen levels of at least 30% to survive.  The pollution was the legacy of raw sewage and industrial waste including chemicals being discharged into the river.  George Ager, of the Environment Agency, said: ""This is fantastic news for the Mersey.  ""It was once a prolific fishery famed for its salmon, but after the Industrial Revolution it became infamous for pollution.  ""Not so long ago, people said there were no fish in the estuary, and folklore was that you couldn't drown in it because you'd be poisoned first.  ""But nearly 20 years of hard work have paid off and now we have an estuary to be proud of.""  Tighter regulations on industrial pollution and a huge effort to stop sewage getting into the river have helped clean the river.  In 2002 the agency captured and returned 26 salmon at a fish trap at Woolston Weir, near Warrington.  Other varieties of fish, including brown trout, sea trout, lamprey, dace and cod are also now frequently caught by anglers.  Water sports, including sailing and windsurfing, are also becoming increasingly popular as a result of the clean up, the agency said."
373,"   A select few songs, played on heavy rotation every year, have come to be considered Christmas classics.      The writers and co-writers of three of the biggest festive favourites tell the stories of their songs. How did the song come about? Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Marcia, my wife, said it was a load of rubbish, lyrically and narratively speaking, so she suggested a storyline about a couple who are down on their luck. The guy went out with what little money they had to buy a Christmas tree and presents but, on the way, he decided to go into the bookies and it all went horribly wrong - he came back and they had a row. The row was quite a crucial part of it. But then there was a redemptive quality - love took over from the more material aspects of Christmas. Christmas number two for The Pogues in 1987 It was co-written with the band's frontman, Shane MacGowan The hit version, featuring Kirsty MacColl and produced by Steve Lillywhite, was recorded two years later Multi-instrumentalist Finer, 53, of London, last performed song ""the night before last"" with The Pogues Favourite other festive song is Captain Beefheart's There Ain't No Santa Claus on the Evenin' Stage Shane [MacGowan] had been working on the same idea as well, a Christmas duet. He had written the first section and we kept the melody from my first song - the one with the really bad story - and basically the storyline from the second one, which Shane transposed to New York and rewrote in his own inimitable style. Do you get bored with it? I never got bored of performing it. There's always a lot of excitement. There's excitement when another singer arrives on stage - for the last few years it's been one of our daughters, Ella. Then when people realise it's Fairytale of New York, the piano starts out, then they get more excited. The audience always respond in increments of excitement. It must be disappointing that the song didn't reach number one. It doesn't surprise me that the Pet Shop Boys with a not-very-interesting remake of an Elvis Presley song [Always On My Mind] got the Christmas number one. I wrote a Christmas song called Is It Christmas Time on Venus? I don't think it's going to knock Fairytale off its pedestal    I suppose it might be nice to be number one but, as far as I'm concerned, it's had a longer life than that particular song. Have you written any other Christmas songs? I worked in an astrophysics department for a couple of years as an artist-in-residence, and I formed a band there. I wrote a Christmas song there called Is It Christmas Time on Venus? I don't think it's going to knock Fairytale off its pedestal. Has the song provided you with your pension? I don't know because I'm not of pensionable age. I'll let you know when I've got my bus pass. ROY WOOD - I WISH IT COULD BE CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY How did the song come about? Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. I actually had some ideas for the song about two years before we recorded it and I'd written bits for it and kept it in a folder until I was in the mood to write the whole thing. We recorded it in the August and, to try and get the atmosphere going, I went into the recording studio early on with the road crew and we put on some big fans and blue lights and left them on for an hour. So we got the band to record the song in overcoats and scarves and we put a Christmas tree up and lights and all that sort of stuff. Do you get bored with it? A lot of songs that were hits for me years ago, I do get bored of, to be honest, because I've been singing them for donkey's years. The Christmas one's different. Wood's song, performed by his band, Wizzard, reached number four in 1973 Wood, aged ""older than you"", lives in Derbyshire, and performs with The Roy Wood Rock 'n' Roll Band He last played the song ""two nights ago"" Wood has a gold disc for the record - from ""the days when you really had to sell a lot of records"" Favourite other festive song is All I Want for Christmas Is You, by Mariah Carey I listen to a lot of the stuff I've recorded in the past when it comes on the radio and you think, with modern technology you could have recorded it a lot better than that. But the Christmas one is different because it's just got a certain atmosphere about it and you think, well yeah, it was all right. It must be disappointing that the song didn't reach number one. I think the main reason that Slade hit the Christmas number one slot that year [with Merry Xmas Everybody] was that their record company released it three weeks before ours and they had more time to get the sales. Have you written any other Christmas songs? In 1980, I wrote a New Year song called Sing Out The Old, Bring In The New. Unfortunately, the radio stations were just playing I Wish It Could Be Christmas and they wouldn't play the new one. I was competing against myself. Has the song provided you with your pension? I'd rather rely on that than the modern day pension. You don't get it at Christmas, though. You have to wait until they work it all out so I'm usually broke at Christmas! How did the song come about? Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. It was written in 1976 for a musical of Hans Christian Anderson's The Little Match Girl, which I directed. The song was written as almost the opposite to its meaning now. We wanted a satirical Christmas carol when the little match girl is being kicked away into the snow by the unfeeling middle classes in a Dickensian setting. The turning point of it was when Twiggy sang it on a TV production of the show in 1987. By this time it had got itself into being used in a different way in the show - she sings it as a sort of pub song - she's playing the local whore. It was Christmas number one for Cliff Richard in 1988. It sold 750,000 copies It was co-written with Leslie Stewart and Keith Strachan Cliff's 99th single, it was the best-selling single of the year Screenwriter and playwright Paul, 69, admits the song has been mocked by ""sophisticated musos"" as ""old codswallop"" Favourite other festive song is Santa Baby, by Eartha Kitt She sings it lustily and all the people in the pub sing it along with her. The director of the television show, Michael Custance, moved house. This is the freaky thing about it - his new next door neighbour had been a roadie with Sir Cliff [Richard]. They got talking, virtually over the garden fence, and Michael played the show to this guy and he picked out Mistletoe and Wine and he said, ""I think Cliff would be interested in this"". In 1988, he brought it out for the Christmas song and the rest is history - the moral is never throw out your old songs. We were absolutely overwhelmed by it. We didn't particularly, the three of us co-writers, at that point, understand the power of Cliff's world. Do you get bored with it? No. I think kids can skip to it, old granddads can enjoy it. I think it evokes Christmas past, even going back to the war. Each generation can bring a private view of it. It hits the spots that surprise people. And as many people as get it on the level I've just described, are the people that are saying ""what a trashy song"" and they're entitled to that, as well. Have you written any other Christmas songs? No. Because the only context in which I have written any songs at all is in the context of writing a musical - I'm not really in the business. It's a one-off. It's a freak or a fluke - a happy accident. Has the song provided you with your pension? The truth is it has. And it's pretty constant. Each time you think, ""oh, it'll dip this year"", it sort of flares back into life.     "
374,"Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has urged Ed Miliband to use new rules to change his shadow cabinet.  Delegates at Labour's conference have voted to allow party leaders to choose their own cabinet when in opposition, rather than have MPs elect it.  ""There are some people in there who are undoubtedly not carrying their weight,"" Lord Prescott told the Today programme.  For the first time in 40 years, the Labour peer is not attending this week's party conference in Liverpool.  Lord Prescott stepped down as an MP at the general election in 2010 and failed in his bid to become Labour Party Treasurer at last year's conference.  He told Today some shadow cabinet members were not even campaigning.  ""This is a Tory government that's doing some outrageous things and we haven't had many words of protest. Ed, you're the leader, get a shadow cabinet who'll do that.""  Lord Prescott also urged Mr Miliband and his colleagues to stop apologising for Labour's record.  ""They all seem to accept that the 13 years of Labour was a failure despite the record levels of employment, record of investment in housing, minimum wage, SureStart and all that,"" he said.  ""I say stop apologising for that, stop complaining and get out campaigning.""  Describing Mr Miliband as a ""man with a good heart"", the Labour peer warned him to keep to the party's traditional values.  ""I've been 50 years in the Labour Party, I've listened to the debates between the left and right and it's always vigorous,"" he said.  ""Then it became old and New Labour, now we've got this kind of rainbow politics - this kind of movement from red Labour to blue Labour to purple Labour.  The Labour Party conference is being held at Liverpool's Arena and Convention Centre and is scheduled to run until Thursday."
375,"Iraqi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the mainly Shia country's Sunni vice-president, leading to fears of the government's collapse and an increase in sectarian tensions.  The warrant for Tariq al-Hashemi was issued under anti-terrorism laws, interior ministry officials said.  It came after bodyguards of Mr Hashemi who were arrested reportedly accused him of having links to terrorism.  The main Sunni political bloc has said it is boycotting cabinet in response.  The Al-Iraqiya parliamentary bloc, which represents most of Iraq's Sunni Arab community, had already withdrawn from parliament, accusing Shia Arab Prime Minister Nouri Maliki of monopolising power. Mr Hashemi has been an outspoken critic of Mr Maliki.  President Jalal Talabani's office issued a statement saying he was ""surprised"" at the announcement of the warrant.  ""Making hasty decisions and announcing them in the media will complicate the political solutions needed in this delicate stage in Iraq's history,"" the statement said.  The BBC Middle East correspondent Jim Muir says Iraq is now facing its biggest political crisis since the unity government was formed a year ago, after months of drawn-out negotiations.  The upheaval comes the day after US troops withdrew from Iraq.  On Monday, Iraq's state-run television aired what it said were confessions by alleged terrorists linked to Mr Hashemi. The men said they had been paid by Mr Hashemi's office to carry out attacks on officials and police officers.  One man said he had been given $3,000 (£2,000) by Mr Hashemi himself. The identities of the men could not be confirmed, and Mr Mutlak said al-Iraqiya did not recognise the confessions.  Maj-Gen Kamal Hussein, a senior interior ministry official, told a news conference: ""According to article four of the anti-terrorism law, an arrest warrant has been issued against Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi and it is signed by five judges.""  Mr Hashemi, who has been banned from leaving Iraq, is reported to have flown to the semi-autonomous northern enclave of Kurdistan on Sunday, but our correspondent says he is unlikely to be arrested immediately.  The warrant was drawn up on Saturday, but its announcement was delayed as attempts were made to convince the Sunni bloc not to begin its boycott.  Those attempts appear to have failed, says our correspondent, as Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlak has now said al-Iraqiya ministers will suspend their participation in the cabinet.  Mr Mutlak said the decision was ""based on the deterioration of the political process, and to ensure that the country will not head towards a catastrophe if Maliki's dictatorship continues"".  Iraq's government of national unity was formed in December last year, after months of debate following inconclusive elections in March. It was intended to include all of Iraq's main political factions.  But the increase of divisions along Sunni-Shia lines has led to fears of a return to the sectarian clashes which killed thousands in 2006-7. The absence of US troops who previously maintained security has increased these concerns.  Former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was a Sunni, and many Sunnis believe they are being penalised by the Shias, who have grown in influence since the US invasion.  Sunnis have accused Mr Maliki of taking an authoritarian approach to government.  The president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Massoud Barzani, earlier called for talks to prevent the ""collapse"" of the unity government, warning that ""the situation is headed towards deep crisis"".  White House spokesman Jay Carney said the US was urging all sides to ""work to resolve differences peacefully and through dialogue in a manner consistent with the rule of law and the democratic political process""."

377,"     Water management officials said the spill, believed to contain heavy metals, had dyed the river black for at least 20 kilometres.      The news came as Hungarian, Romanian and Ukrainian officials began talks in Debrecen in eastern Hungary to discuss the pollution of the region.     Serious situation      Hungary had been warned about the spill by Ukraine, through which the Tisza passes before entering Hungarian territory.      Hungarian radio quoted catastrophe prevention official Sandor Istenes as saying it was caused by the breach of a reservoir dyke at mining works in Baia Borsa, northern Romania.    The same mining works were responsible for a spill into the river last week of 20,000 cubic metres of sludge containing zinc, lead and copper.      Hungary has asked Romania to identify and, if necessary, close industrial plants that pose a serious danger to the environment.      It has also asked the European Union to help identify hazardous sites in Romania and either help improve them or close them down.      Deputy State Secretary Gabor Bagi summoned the Romanian Ambassador Petru Cordos on Tuesday to warn him the situation was ""extraordinary and serious"".     Emergency measures      The Hungarian authorities have reimplemented the emergency measures put into practice after the previous spills.      These include banning the use of river water for any purpose, including irrigation.      They have also sealed off side tributaries of the Tisza and the Tisza Lake, in an effort to protect them from pollution.      In January, a spill of sludge laced with cyanide from another mine in Romania entered the river, killing some 200 tons of fish.      The spills have been described as the most serious environmental disaster to hit eastern Europe since the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant nearly 15 years ago.      A new pollution spill from Romania has entered the River Tisza in Hungary - the third such spill in six weeks.Water management officials said the spill, believed to contain heavy metals, had dyed the river black for at least 20 kilometres.The news came as Hungarian, Romanian and Ukrainian officials began talks in Debrecen in eastern Hungary to discuss the pollution of the region.Hungary had been warned about the spill by Ukraine, through which the Tisza passes before entering Hungarian territory.Hungarian radio quoted catastrophe prevention official Sandor Istenes as saying it was caused by the breach of a reservoir dyke at mining works in Baia Borsa, northern Romania."
378,"There are several different sorts of pacifism, but they all include the idea that war and violence are unjustifiable, and that conflicts should be settled in a peaceful way. The word (but not the idea) is only a century old, being first used in 1902 at the 10th International Peace Conference. People are pacifists for one or some of these reasons: non-religious belief in the sanctity of life practical belief that war is wasteful and ineffective Many believe that pacifism is more than opposition to war. They argue that it must include action to promote justice and human rights. (Consider for example whether the preservation of peace throughout the British Empire justified the human rights violations of that colonial regime.) It's important to see the difference between the morality of pacifism as it applies to an individual, and the application of that morality to the behaviour of a nation-state. Not appreciating this difference can lead to real difficulties in discussing pacifism and non-violence. Pacifists are often thought of as totally opposed to killing, but they don't have to be. A pacifist can logically support euthanasia and abortion, although they would need to have thought their position through very carefully.  An absolute pacifist believes that it is never right to take part in war, even in self-defence. They think that the value of human life is so high that nothing can justify killing a person deliberately. To stick to this principle consistently is hard. It views it as unethical to use violence to rescue an innocent person who is being attacked and may be killed, and this is not a comfortable moral position. Absolute pacifists usually hold this view as a basic moral or spiritual principle, without regard to the results of war or violence, however they could logically argue that violence always leads to worse results than non-violence. Conditional pacifists are against war and violence in principle, but they accept that there may be circumstances when war will be less bad than the alternative. Conditional pacifists usually base their moral code on Utilitarian principles - it's the bad consequences that make it wrong to resort to war or violence. Other pacifists believe that it is a matter of degree, and only oppose wars involving weapons of mass destruction - nuclear or chemical and biological weapons - either because of the uniquely devastating consequences of such weapons, or because a war that uses such weapons is not 'winnable'. Pacifists are heavily involved in political activity to promote peace, and to argue against particular wars. During a war many pacifists will refuse to fight, but some will take part in activities that seek to reduce the harm of war; e.g. by driving ambulances, but other pacifists will refuse to take part in any activity that might support the war. Not all pacifists are brave enough to act according to these beliefs and to refuse to fight, but many have, bravely choosing punishment, and even execution, rather than go to war. Nowadays most democratic countries accept that people have the right of conscientious objection to military service, but they usually expect the objector to undertake some form of public service as an alternative.  Pacifism as national policy for a nation is almost unheard of, for the obvious reason that it will only work if no-one wants to attack your country, or the nation with whom you are in dispute is also committed to pacifism. In any other circumstances adopting a pacifist stance will result in your country rapidly being conquered. However, the idea of pacifism, and of seeking non-violent solutions to disputes between nations, plays a significant part in international politics, particularly through the work of the United Nations. Those who oppose pacifism say that because the world is not perfect, war is not always wrong. They say that states have a duty to protect their citizens, and that citizens have a duty to carry out certain tasks in a Just War. It doesn't matter that pacifists are motivated by respect for human life and a love of peace. The pacifists' refusal to participate in war does not make them noble idealists, but people who are failing to carry out an important moral obligation. A second argument says that pacifism has no place in the face of extreme evil. The war against Nazi Germany was a war against extreme wickedness, and in 1941 an editorial in the Times Literary Supplement wrote: We have discovered that there is something more horrible than war - the killing of the spirit in the body, the Nazi contempt for the individual man. The world reeks with the foulness of the crimes in occupied Europe, where a Dark Age has begun anew. Because most societies regard going to war as fulfilling a citizen's ethical duty, they honour and remember those who give their lives in war. If we believe that war is governed by ethics we should only honour those who give their lives in a Just War, and who followed the rules of war. So, for example, it should be wrong to honour dead soldiers who killed the enemy or wounded or raped enemy women. (But this distinction is not usually made about those who fought on 'our' side.) A more tricky moral dilemma is presented by the case of soldiers who died while fighting 'justly' for an unjust war. Many soldiers died fighting honourably and decently for Germany in World War II. But since the war was a blatantly aggressive and unjust war would it be wrong to honour such soldiers for their sacrifice?  Pacifism became widespread as a reaction to the scale of killing in the First World War and the use of universal male conscription, and gained further support after the creation of nuclear weapons. However, the Holocaust, and other industrial scale abuses of human rights, caused many to think that there could be cases when war was the least-bad course of action. In World War 1 those who refused to fight were known as 'conscientious objectors'. They numbered about 16,000. While the name was intended to make it clear that it was conscience not cowardice that kept pacifists out of the military, it was rapidly shortened to 'Conshie' and used as a term of abuse. Some pacifists were prepared to work in non-combat roles as medical orderlies, stretcher-bearers, ambulance drivers, cooks or labourers, while others refused to do anything that might help the war effort. Over 500 of these were imprisoned under harsh conditions. There were two major pacifist organisations in World War 1: the Fellowship of Reconciliation, and the No-Conscription Fellowship (both founded in 1914). In 1923 a Christian Pacifist MP was elected to parliament. In the middle 1930s the Peace Pledge Union gained wide support. Pacifism gained great publicity from a 1933 student debate in the Oxford University Union that voted for a resolution that 'this House will in no circumstances fight for King and Country'. In World War 2, there were 59,000 British conscientious objectors, who received rather better treatment than in the previous war. Some religions, such as Buddhism, promote pacifism. Others have strong pacifist elements, such as Christianity, but have accepted that war is inevitable and sought to provide moral guidance in dealing with conflict. Judaism, like other religions, is strongly opposed to violence, and where violence is permitted the minimum necessary should be used. But Jewish law does occasionally argue that violence may be the only solution: it imposes a moral obligation to save the life of a person who is being killed, even if the only way of doing so is to kill the attacker. (This demonstrates that Judaism regards going to the aid of someone who is being attacked as a higher moral duty than not injuring people.) Jewish law also specifically obliges Jews to use violence on the Sabbath as a response to an invasion."

380,"The mother of one of the Moors murder victims has died after a long battle against liver cancer.  Ann West's daughter Lesley Ann Downey was killed by Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, after abducting her on Boxing Day 1964.  Mrs West, 69, died at her home in Fallowfield, Manchester, on Tuesday.  She was at the centre of the campaign to ensure Hindley remained behind bars, and fellow relatives of her victims have described her as an inspiration.  Danny Kilbride, younger brother of victim John Kilbride, said: ""I have known her really well over the years; we fought for the same thing.  ""When I last saw Ann she told me she hadn't long left, and we all knew that, and she asked to carry on the fight.  ""This has only made me more determined than ever to carry it on, to ensure their memories live on and that Myra Hindley is never released.""  Winnie Johnson, whose 12-year-old son Keith Bennett was also killed, described Mrs West as an incredible woman.  Meanwhile, Lyn Costello and Dee Warner from Mothers Against Murder and Aggression said they were ""privileged"" to have known her.  ""She was an incredible and brave woman,"" they said.  ""We will remember Ann with love and pride and send our deepest sympathy to her husband Alan, her children and grandchildren.""  Lesley Ann Downey was 10 years old when she was kidnapped by Hindley and Brady from a fairground in Manchester.  She was stripped, gagged, sexually assaulted and strangled before being buried in a shallow grave on Lancashire's bleak Saddleworth Moor.  Mrs West saw photographs taken by her daughter's killers showing Lesley Ann tied up and helpless in the hours leading up to her death.  She also had to listen to Brady and Hindley's tape recording of her daughter's cries for mercy.  Mrs West was adamant that it was Hindley's hands which squeezed out her daughter's final breath and had threatened to kill her on many occasions.  She also vowed to haunt Hindley from beyond the grave, saying: ""I will still be a thorn in her side after I pass on, I will haunt that woman for the rest of her life.""  Over the years Mrs West had used psychic Doris Stokes to contact her daughter who she believed had visited her many times.  For years she had taken valium and high-dose sleeping pills to cope with nightmares.  Her doctors said that the years of stress had contributed to the cancer which affected her ovaries, breast, bowel and liver.  But the illness did not stop her campaigning and in 1997 she visited a High Court hearing on Hindley's future in a wheelchair.  At the time she told BBC News she was determined that Hindley should end her life behind bars.  She said she would rest in peace if the court ensured that Hindley remains in prison.  That wish was granted last year when the court agreed with successive home secretaries who had prevented the killer's release."
381,"When a tiny stage next to Liverpool's Cavern Club drew a crowd of thousands one bank holiday weekend, it was clear something special was taking place.  Local band Alternative Radio were on the bill with several other acts, and 18,000 people had come to see them. The Mathew Street Music Festival was taking shape.  This year, the two-day free music event is set to draw more than 300,000 people to watch live bands perform on five stages across the city centre.  Dave Jones, who has been involved with the festival from its first year in 1992, said it has grown ""exponentially"" since then.  He said the festival, which showcases local bands and a great many tribute acts, evolved out of International Beatle Week, which he has organised since 1986.  But the bands were steered towards Mathew Street after Mr Jones took on the lease of the Cavern and wanted to encourage the crowds towards the club to spend their money there.  In its first year in 1992, bands played at various venues in Mathew Street, but the following year the first outdoor stage was introduced.  Mr Jones said: ""We knew that we would get some people but we got 18,000 people, into the street.  ""We involved all the various bars and we supplied all the bands. It worked really well and it was a huge success.  ""We were amazed, it was a great day.""  He added: ""The next year we decided we needed another stage, and we had a stage in North John Street, to cope with the 18,000 people, but we actually got 42,000 people.""  For the following few years, festival organisers were granted money from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to help cover costs.  Today, it is organised by Liverpool City Council but Cavern Club directors Mr Jones and Bill Heckle remain in charge of the artistic content.  It is an arrangement described by Mr Jones as ""a great partnership"", but one which is by no means certain, as the council deals with cuts to its budget.  It has cut £50m from its budget this year and needs to find a further £21.6m in 2013-14.  A council spokesman said no decision on funding the festival had been made but that it would be something it would be looking at closely.  The event is the largest free music festival in Europe, with musicians from all around the world performing.  Bands performing this Sunday and Monday include tributes to Queen and U2, as well as original bands from the 1960s such as The Merseybeats, Mike Pender's Searchers and Gerry and the Pacemakers.  This year's event will celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Beatles, and many acts are expected to incorporate a Beatles element in their sets.  Liverpool City Council's cabinet member for culture and tourism Wendy Simon said: ""To attract bands from all over the world is a real testament to Mathew Street Music Festival, which is a much-loved event for the hundreds of thousands of music lovers who travel to Liverpool each year to enjoy this free, outdoor experience."""
382,"The Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, has been killed by a bomb blast on his boat in Ireland.  One of the earl's twin grandsons, Nicholas, 14, and Paul Maxwell, 15, a local employed as a boat boy, also died in the explosion.  The attack was followed only hours later by the massacre of 18 soldiers, killed in two booby-trap bomb explosions near Warrenpoint close to the border with the Irish Republic.  The IRA has already admitted carrying out the attack on Lord Mountbatten.  A statement from the organisation said: ""This operation is one of the discriminate ways we can bring to the attention of the English people the continuing occupation of our country.""  Lord Mountbatten, aged 79, and his family had traditionally spent their summer holiday at their castle in County Sligo, north west of Ireland.  They were aboard his boat, Shadow V, which had just set off from the fishing village of Mullaghmore, when the bomb detonated around 1130 BST.  A witness said the blast blew the boat ""to smithereens"" and hurled all seven occupants into the water.  Nearby fishermen raced to the rescue and pulled Lord Mountbatten out of the water.  But his legs had been almost severed by the explosion and he died shortly afterwards.  Other survivors were pulled out of the water and rushed to hospital.  At least one person is believed to be in a critical condition.  The attack has called into question the security arrangements surrounding the Mountbatten party. Lord Mountbatten never had a bodyguard.  The local police kept watch on Classiebawn castle for the one month a year Lord Mountbatten spent there.  But his boat was left unguarded in the public dock in Mullaghmore where it was moored.  The village is only 12 miles from the Northern Ireland border and near an area known to be used by IRA members as a refuge."
383,"Belgium has sworn in a new government, ending a record-breaking 541 days of political deadlock.  New Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo was sworn in by King Albert II at the royal palace along with his 12 cabinet ministers and six secretaries of state.  Mr Di Rupo, a French-speaking Socialist, took the oath of office in French, Dutch and German - reflecting language sensitivities in the country.  The Europe crisis is thought to have spurred politicians to find a solution.  Belgium had been run by a caretaker administration since the last government resigned in April 2010.  The delay in forming a new government revolved around arguments over budget and immigration issues, but originally started with a row over the distribution of voting rights between the French-speaking and Flemish communities, the BBC's Matt Cole in Brussels reports.  Belgium now holds the modern-day record for the country which has gone the longest without a government - beating previous title holder Cambodia by 182 days.  The situation had been as much a source of amusement as anger among Belgians, our correspondent says.  Demonstrations calling on politicians to resolve the crisis had been held, but there had also been more light-hearted protests including a group who refused to shave their beards until an administration was formed, he adds.  Politicians have been under pressure from financial markets and ratings agencies to create an effective government capable of carrying out structural reforms and reducing debt.  Last month, ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Belgium's credit rating to AA from AA+, which could make it more expensive for Belgium to borrow in future.  This is thought to have been the catalyst for the six parties now in coalition to finally agree a new administration headed by Mr Di Rupo.  Mr Di Rupo, 60, is Belgium's first French-speaking prime minister in three decades and the first Socialist to take the premiership in Belgium since 1974.  Didier Reynders, who held the role of finance minister in the caretaker administration, will swap portfolios with the temporary Foreign Minister Steven Vanackere, said the palace statement."
384,"United Russia, backed by President Vladimir Putin, is leading in 13 regions, while a new pro-Putin party, A Fair Russia, leads in the other region.  The elections are widely considered a rehearsal for upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections.  Opposition parties said they had been sidelined and dubbed the polls a sham.  The chairman of the Central Election Commission, Alexander Veshnyakov, said the preliminary results indicated that United Russia had won an average of 46% of the votes across the 14 regions.  Only in the southern region of Stavropol did A Fair Russia get more votes. However, the complex system there means that United Russia may end up with more seats in the regional assembly.  A Fair Russia was formed late last year with the Kremlin's support as a means, officials said, to strengthen Russia's multi-party system.  Critics have said the party was created to foster the illusion of democracy in Russia.  Election officials said the Communist Party had secured 12.5% of the seats in the regional assemblies while A Fair Russia was close behind with 11.7%.  Turnout was 39.1% of the 14 regions' 31 million eligible voters - about one-third of Russia's total electorate.  Yabloko was barred from contesting four of the nine races it wanted to enter because it had failed to meet tough new election criteria. It had a poor showing in the other five regions.  Mr Ivanyenko said they were elections in name only ""which look like democracy but where in fact the authorities hand out votes and determine which parties and candidates are convenient for them,"" he told Reuters news agency.  The vote was the first test of new electoral laws introduced last year.  The minimum threshold of the vote a party needs to secure seats was raised; the minimum voter turnout for elections to be valid was lowered; and the ""against all"" option on ballot papers was eliminated.  The BBC's Russian affairs analyst Steven Eke says the overall result was to halve the number of political parties registered in Russia and to destroy any possibility of the smaller, liberal opposition parties having their candidates elected.  The Russian government says it wanted to create a more efficient system based on two or three parties.  Opponents of the changes say they were designed to ensure the Kremlin maintains control over the country's electoral system ahead of parliamentary elections later this year and a vote to choose a successor to Mr Putin next year."
385,"A US judge has dismissed a legal action accusing Harry Potter author JK Rowling of copying the work of another author.  The estate of late author Adrian Jacobs claimed that the plot of fourth Harry Potter outing Goblet of Fire plagiarised parts of his book The Adventures of Willy the Wizard.  Judge Shira Sheindlin wrote in her ruling that there were major differences between the two works.  She added they were ""distinctly different in both substance and style"".  ""The contrast between the total concept and feel of the works is so stark that any serious comparison of the two strains credulity,"" Judge Sheindlin said in the 49-page ruling.  Scholastic, the US publisher for the Harry Potter books, said it was satisfied with the decision.  ""The court's swift dismissal supports our position that the case was completely without merit and that comparing Willy the Wizard to the Harry Potter series was absurd,"" spokesman Kyle Good said.  ""Scholastic will continue to vigorously defend any such frivolous claims challenging the originality of Harry Potter.""  The estate of British author Jacobs, who died in 1997, had claimed Rowling copied the plots of his 1987 book including a wizard contest, and the idea of wizards travelling on trains.  When the estate filed a similar legal action against British publisher Bloomsbury last February, Rowling said that she had never heard of Mr Jacobs's book before the original copyright claim was made in 2004.  In October, the judge overseeing that case at London's High Court said that the claims were ""improbable,"" but he turned down an application by lawyers for Rowling and Bloomsbury for an immediate dismissal of the case.  The first Harry Potter Book was published in 1997 and the series has sold more than 400 million copies worldwide."

387,"Goddess Vanessa is a professional dominatrix. She lives in New York.  It was role play, no experience necessary, no nudity. At that point, I had a big notion of whips and chains and leather, but I don't think I really understood the psychological dynamic.  I started working at a dungeon. The formal introduction was to come in and observe. I was in for about five minutes before a lightbulb lit up, and I said to myself, ""I understand this.""  Sebastian is one of my clients. I will call him and tell him when I have time to meet with him. So if I just want to be pampered I'll tell him to come over at a specific time and he'll bring over some groceries or things that I'll need and he'll give me a foot massage.  And other times I'll be in the mood to be a bit more aggressive and to play with him, and he makes himself available to that.  We get into heavy bondage. We try different things in terms of compromising positions for a man, including hog-tied - on your knees, hands behind your back, so that your ankles and your wrists are tied together, and there's another piece of rope that comes around so that your head movement is also restricted by your ankles.  And then we get into some meditative flogging.  What's really special about Sebastian is that he's really gone beyond engaging in these practices for personal sexual gratification.  For him, it's really about the sacrifice and the service.  So when we get into heavy flogging, it's important for him to be in a sacred ritual space.  We don't engage in any verbal back-and-forth. It becomes a moment for meditation and silence and contemplation.  The only thing you usually hear is the sound of the whip on his skin.  This is not in monetary or material terms, but in terms of just setting specific goals with the individual I'm dealing with. And that translates to all spheres of my life.  I think the most concise way to define the power of a submissive is to acknowledge that submission must come from a place of power.  So in other words, the submissive doesn't have power to give if he is not self-sufficient and secure in his own ability. It's a form of chivalry.  It's like a powerful knight before his queen. A knight is a noble figure, but he lays those skills down at the feet of whomever he serves.  Dominating a man who isn't self-assured and confident in what he's giving is really a futile activity. There's nothing to be gained. There's no satisfaction in breaking somebody who's already broken, or conquering someone who's already weak.  A submissive's role as a submissive has to come from a place of power, because otherwise there's really nothing for that submissive to lay at the feet of his ruler.     It gives me a sense of self-worth, a sense of value.  I think people have a desire to feel important and to feel valuable. For myself, being able to serve someone whom I view as a perfect individual, it gives me inner validation as an individual. I don't feel humiliated doing it.  The person who rules my world, as Submissive Sebastian, is Goddess Vanessa - without a doubt.  She is the person who is on my mind during the day. And when I go to sleep I say a special prayer for her.  I have a picture of her on my cell phone, so immediately when I turn on my cell phone I see her. I have a picture of her in my wallet.  Literally, she is the person I think of all the time in my daily life. And let's say I'm going to be making a decision, I think, hmm, what would my Goddess tell me to do?  So for me definitely it would be Goddess Vanessa who runs my life. Definitely.   "
388,"The three major voyages of discovery of Captain James Cook provided his European masters with unprecedented information about the Pacific Ocean, and about those who lived on its islands and shores. His achievements were the more remarkable because of his humble origins in an agricultural labouring family, from Marton, North Yorkshire. ... he intended to go not only 'farther than any man has been before me, but as far as I think it possible for man to go'. Cook first went to sea at the age of 18. He spent ten years working in the coal trade of the east coast of England - with its shoreline of treacherous, shifting shoals, uncharted shallows, and difficult harbours. In 1755 he joined the Royal Navy, and within two years passed his master's examination to qualify for the navigation and handling of a royal ship. He gained surveying experience in North American waters during the Seven Years War - as Britain and France fought for supremacy in North America - and spent the first years of peace between 1763 and 1767 charting the fog-shrouded coastline of Newfoundland. During those years he gained a practical training in mathematics and astronomy, and steadily accumulated the technical skills needed to make an effective explorer. The following years were to show that in addition he possessed those less tangible qualities, of leadership, determination and ambition, which made him the outstanding explorer of the 18th century. As he wrote, he intended to go not only 'farther than any man has been before me, but as far as I think it possible for man to go'.  Cook's first voyage (1768-71) was a collaborative venture under the auspices of the Admiralty and the Royal Society. The original intention was to organise a scientific voyage to observe the transit of the planet Venus from Tahiti, and this was supplemented by instructions to search for the great southern continent, Terra Australis Incognita, whose location had intrigued and baffled European navigators and projectors since the 16th century. With Lieutenant Cook (as he was at that time) sailed the botanist Joseph Banks, the astronomer Charles Green, and a small retinue of scientific assistants and artists. Cook's ship, the Endeavour, was a bluff-bowed Whitby collier chosen for her strength, shallow draught, and storage capacity. Although the ship was to change, the type did not; the Resolution of the second and third voyages was of the same build, and even came from the same shipyard as the Endeavour, to whose qualities, wrote Cook, 'those on board owe their Preservation. Hence I was enabled to prosecute Discoveries in those Seas so much longer than any other Man ever did or could do.' ... Cook had put more than 5,000 miles of previously unknown coastline on the map. Cook sailed first to Tahiti to carry out those astronomical observations that were the initial reason for the voyage, before turning south where, his instructions told him, 'there is reason to imagine that a Continent or Land of great extent, may be found.' After reaching latitude 40°S, without sight of land, he sailed west to New Zealand, whose coasts he charted in a little over six months to show that they were not part of a southern continent. From there Cook pointed the Endeavour towards the unexplored eastern parts of New Holland (the name given by the Dutch to Australia in the 17th century). Cook sailed north along the shores of present-day New South Wales and Queensland, charting as he went. After a hair-raising escape from the dangers of the Great Barrier Reef he reached the northern tip of Australia at Cape York, where he annexed the east coast on the grounds that it was terra nullius, no person's land. He then sailed through the Torres Strait, so settling the dispute as to whether New Holland and New Guinea were joined. With only one ship Cook had put more than 5,000 miles of previously unknown coastline on the map. The twin islands of New Zealand, the east coast of Australia and the Torres Strait had at last emerged from the mists of uncertainty.  Cook's second voyage (1772-75) was the logical complement to what had been explored, and left unexplored, on his first. Again there were scientists and artists on board, and for the first time chronometers, one of which was Kendall's copy of John Harrison's famous no. 4 marine chronometer. This superb instrument kept accurate time throughout the buffeting it endured on the long voyage, showing that a practical solution to the problem of determining longitude at sea had been found. In his three years away, the newly-promoted Captain Cook disposed of the imagined southern continent, reached closer to the South Pole than any previous navigator, and touched on many lands - Tahiti and New Zealand again, and for the first time Easter Island, the Marquesas Islands, Tonga and the New Hebrides. ... on his two voyages he had laid down the essentials of the modern map of the South Pacific. Most of these places had been sighted by explorers on earlier expeditions, so that even by conventional definitions Cook did not 'discover' them for Europe. His contribution was to bring order to confusion, to replace vagueness and uncertainty with a scrupulous accuracy. He had, he explained, put an end to the search for the great southern continent, 'which has at time ingrossed the attention of some of the Maritime Powers for near two Centuries past and the Geographers of all ages.' But his achievement was more than this, for on his two voyages he had laid down the essentials of the modern map of the South Pacific.  On his return from his second voyage, Cook found that his fame had spread beyond naval circles. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded its Copley Gold Medal, was painted by Nathaniel Dance, dined with James Boswell, and was described in the House of Lords as 'the first navigator in Europe'. Brief thoughts of retirement were replaced by a determination to return to the Pacific. Cook's third and final voyage (1776-80) had its own logic in that it took him to the North Pacific in an effort to solve a geographical mystery as old as the southern continent - the question of the existence of a navigable north west passage. ... in a single season Cook put the main outline of the coast of north west America on the maps ... As he approached the north west coast of America in 1778, Cook made the major discovery of the Hawaiian Islands, the northernmost outliers of Polynesia. He spent that summer in hazardous exploration along the American coast from Vancouver Island to the Bering Strait, searching in vain for the wide strait leading to an ice-free Arctic Ocean, as indicated on the speculative maps of the period. Although he found no north west passage, in a single season Cook put the main outline of the coast of north west America on the maps, determined the shape of Alaska well beyond the Bering Strait, and closed the gap between the Spanish coastal probes from the south and those of the Russians from Kamchatka. It was to be his last achievement, for the following winter he was killed on his return to the Hawaiian Islands. His death at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779 has remained a source of scholarly controversy. During the weeks after his arrival Cook seems to have been regarded by the Hawaiians as the god Lono, bringer of light, peace and plenty, for he had arrived at the time of makahiki, Lono's festival. Cook continued to conform to the sacred calendar of the islanders by sailing away from Hawaii as makahiki came to an end. However, the Resolution got damaged at sea, so that Cook was forced to return to the bay to repair his ship out of the correct season, thus making himself a violator of sacred customs. It was noted that there was an eerie atmosphere among the islanders following his return, and Cook's death after an argument on the beach was predictable if not preordained. Not all accept this interpretation. Some scholars see Cook's 'deification' as the product of a Western, imperialist tradition, and they explain his death as being the result of a row caused by one of his uncontrollable outbursts of temper, which had become increasingly noticeable during the voyage.  The circumstances of Cook's death were a reminder that one of his tasks was 'to observe the Genius, Temper, Disposition and Number of the Natives'. This was easier said than done, for successive migrations across the Pacific had left societies organised in overlapping layers and groups, and the strained nature of the contact between Europeans and non-Europeans made understanding between them all the more difficult. ... the coming of venereal disease, alcohol and firearms brought a depressing train of consequences to the islands. Cook and his fellow navigators of the period were for the most part humane and moderate commanders. Even so, the Europeans were intruders, emerging by the score from their towering vessels, appearing and disappearing without warning, violating sacred sites. An inescapable tension hung over the encounters, sometimes dissipated by individual contacts or trade, but often erupting into violence and death. Although the relationship between Polynesians and Europeans was not the one-sided affair of some portrayals, in the longer term the coming of venereal disease, alcohol and firearms brought a depressing train of consequences to the islands. Cook set new standards in the extent and accuracy of his surveys, but to see his voyages simply in terms of geographical knowledge would be to miss their broader significance. The observations of Cook and his colleagues played an important role in natural history, astronomy, oceanography, philology and much else. Above all, the voyages helped to give birth in the next century to the new disciplines of ethnology and anthropology. In practical ways, too, Cook set new standards, especially in terms of health. There were no recorded deaths from scurvy on any of his voyages, and few from natural causes generally - except during the Endeavour's disastrous stay at Batavia in 1770, when 30 members of the crew, who had been remarkably healthy until then, died of fever and dysentery. Specialists have corrected the popular view that Cook discovered the cure for scurvy - rather he applied with unusual thoroughness all suggested remedies. He ensured cleanliness and ventilation in the crew's quarters, and insisted on an appropriate diet that included cress, sauerkraut, and a kind of orange extract. Even so, his epitaph in a medical journal claimed that Cook's success in keeping his crews alive 'added more to his fame, and is supposed to have given a more useful lesson to maritime nations, than all the discoveries he ever made'."
389,"The world's largest mass yellow fever immunisation is starting in West Africa, targeting 12 million people.  Health charities are rolling out the vaccines to people in Benin, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Thirteen African nations are said to be at high risk of outbreaks of yellow fever, which can kill if untreated.  Yellow fever is spread through infected mosquitoes and has a wide array of symptoms from nausea and vomiting to kidney failure, jaundice and bleeding.  About half those who develop severe symptoms and are untreated die from the disease - about 30,000 people each year worldwide.  Local health staff in the target countries will vaccinate nearly 12 million people, as well as giving out vitamin A and de-worming tablets.  The World Health Organization says it is not aiming to eliminate yellow fever - there are too many infected mosquitoes in urban areas to make that possible - but to greatly reduce the number of people getting sick with the disease.  It wants to finish mass vaccinations in all high-risk African countries by 2015, but warns there is currently a gap in the funding needed to take the programme to the remaining West African countries most affected by yellow fever."
390,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Samoa has become the first country since the 1970s to change the side of the road on which cars are driven. At 0600 local time (1700 GMT) sirens sounded and drivers were told to move from the right side to the left. Police said that no accidents had been reported in the first hours after the switch in the island nation despite predictions of chaos from critics. The government brought about the change to bring Samoa into line with other South Pacific countries. A two-day holiday was declared to ease traffic as people got used to the new rules. A three-day ban on alcohol sales was also introduced to deter accidents. At 0600, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Lupesoliai Malielegaoi addressed the country on national radio. All we want to see is how smooth it is and how safe it is and I think we've seen that this morning    ""After this announcement you will all be permitted to move to the other side of the road, to begin this new era in our history,"" the New Zealand Herald quoted him as saying. Emergency vehicles and government workers were reportedly stationed at every junction and corner but witnesses said the change happened smoothly. ""All we want to see is how smooth it is and how safe it is and I think we've seen that this morning. You see how cars are moving now, so to me it's good,"" a resident in the capital Apia told Reuters news . However, the switch was briefly disrupted by a protest in a village on Savai'i - the bigger of the nation's two main islands. The protesters blocked roads for several hours, but later allowed traffic to pass through. The changeover survived a late legal appeal by the protest group People Against Switching Sides (Pass), who had argued that it would bring mayhem to the highways and byways of this remote South Pacific nation. Bus drivers have also protested that their doors will now open on the wrong side, in the middle of the road. The Samoan government introduced the change to end its reliance on expensive, left-hand drive imports from America. It hopes that Samoan expatriates in Australia and New Zealand will now ship used, more affordable vehicles back to their homeland. Are you in Samoa? What do you think about this decision?
