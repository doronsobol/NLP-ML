The Zambian government says it's detained eighty-four people in connection with the failed attempt last month to overthrow President Chiluba.  A statement said they were being held under the terms of the state of emergency, but gave no details of how many were military officers or civilians.  Opposition groups say more are being held, and some detainees allege that they have been tortured.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
