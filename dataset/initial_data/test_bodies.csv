0,"Mr Ramos-Horta was shot in a pre-dawn attack on his Dili home, and later airlifted to Australia for treatment.  Mr Gusmao, who was targeted in a separate incident but was unharmed, described the events as a coup attempt.  Rebel leader Alfredo Reinado and another rebel died in the attack on Mr Ramos-Horta.  Australian PM Kevin Rudd pledged to send more peacekeepers to East Timor.  He said the ""attempt to assassinate the democratically elected leadership of a close friend and neighbour of Australia's is a deeply disturbing development"".  The attack on Mr Ramos-Horta happened at about 0700 on Monday (2200 GMT Sunday).  Two cars drove past the president's house on the outskirts of the capital, Dili.  He was outside the compound at the time. He apparently tried to return home after hearing gunshots but was shot on the way in, according to UN officials.  One soldier was also reported to be seriously wounded.  Mr Ramos-Horta was taken to a hospital run by the Australian military in Dili, where he was stabilised.  He was later evacuated to Darwin for further treatment, and put in intensive care on a ventilator.  He received three gunshot wounds - one in the stomach and two in the chest - and his condition is described as ""serious but stable"".  But the Darwin hospital's general manager told AFP news agency he was hopeful for a full recovery.  ""The fact that he is in a stable condition is a good sign that we should see some reasonable outcomes for him,"" Dr Len Notaras said.  ""He's not fighting for his life but his injuries are extremely serious.""  Shots were also fired at Mr Gusmao's convoy, shortly after the attack on Mr Ramos-Horta, but no-one was hurt.  The attack happened after the prime minister had left his house. The vehicles came under heavy fire, and one reportedly left the road and rolled over.  Mr Gusmao told a press briefing that the situation was under control.  ""I consider this incident a coup attempt against the state by Reinado and it failed,"" he said.  ""This government will guarantee security and development will continue.""  He later announced a state of emergency, including a curfew between 2000 and 0600 and a ban on gatherings and protests.  Dili is reported to be quiet and heavily patrolled by local and international security forces.  But the BBC's Andrew Harding says officials are concerned that there could be fighting between rival groups.  An Australian-led UN force has been in charge of security in the capital since mid-2006.  Peacekeepers were invited into the country to quell violent clashes between police and the military, triggered by then Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri's decision to sack a third of the armed forces.  At least 37 people were killed in several weeks of fighting and more than 150,000 were forced to flee their homes.  Reinado, a former naval commander, was accused of being involved in several shooting incidents during the violence and charged with murder.  But he escaped from jail and, with a group of followers, holed himself up in the mountains, refusing government pleas to surrender.  His continued stand-off with the government had led to fears of renewed violence in what is one of the world's newest and poorest nations.  He spent 24 years in exile after Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in 1975, leading the country's bid for independence from overseas and winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.  He served in the more powerful role of prime minister in the wake of the 2006 violence, before elections last year which saw him switch roles with then President Xanana Gusmao."
1,"There had been fears some Manchester City fans would disrupt the silence before the game - in which the visitors beat rivals Manchester United 2-1.  But both sets of supporters inside Old Trafford stood for the full minute without any interruption.  However, several loud bangs appeared to come from outside the stadium.  City boss Sven-Goran Eriksson said: ""I would like to say a big thank you to our fans. They were absolutely fantastic before the game during the minute's silence and of course during the game.""  And the visitors captain Richard Dunne added: ""Our fans were fantastic - everyone within the club knew they would be.  ""We are very proud of them and hopefully they are very proud of our performance.""  Inside the ground, United and City supporters held up special commemorative scarves that had been handed out before the game.  Banners around Old Trafford paid tribute to the 23 people, including eight United players, who died in the disaster on 6 February 1958.  A lone piper led the United and City players out on to the pitch, where they were greeted by a guard of honour of United's youth and reserve players, and mascots wearing shirts bearing the names of the victims, which included former City keeper Frank Swift.  United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and his City counterpart Eriksson laid wreaths in their club colours on either side of the centre circle before embracing.  Thousands of supporters had arrived early at Old Trafford early to leave flowers at a temporary shrine opposite the statue of Sir Matt Busby, the legendary manager in charge of United at the time of the crash.  There were tributes left from all over the world, with one shirt emblazoned with the message 'Busby Babes, forever champions in heaven'.  A new, permanent exhibition about the tragedy was open for the first time, built into the walls of the South Terrace at Old Trafford, which has been renamed the Munich Tunnel."
2,"Veteran actress Madhuri Dixit, who made a grand Bollywood comeback in Yash Raj Films' 2007 dance musical Aaja Nachle (meaning 'come let us dance') will be conferred with the prestigious Padmashri Award for her invaluable contribution to Indian cinema this month.  She then went on to act in box office hits like Ram Lakhan (1989), Parinda (1989), Tridev (1989), Kishen Kanhaiya (1990), Dil (1990), Saajan (1991), Beta (1992), Khalnayak (1993) and the all-time Bollywood smash hit, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun! (1994) and also Raja (1995). All received popular screenings in Shropshire.  Madhuri further reaffirmed her acting prowess in Yash Chopra's blockbuster Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), for which she won a Filmfare Best Actress Award.  But it was not until 2002 that Madhuri won global fame for her work in director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas,Â  in which she shared screen space with the likes of Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai.  Her hard work paid off in the form of the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress award that year.  In 2007, she made a grand Bollywood comeback in Aaja Nachle. Although the film did not any break UK box office records, Madhuri's work was still appreciated by fans and critics alike.  This month, Madhuri Dixit will receive the Padmashri Award, rightly deserved for a Bollywood diva who has carved a small niche for herself in the history of Bollywood."
3,"The Democratic Republic of Congo's President, Joseph Kabila, has been sworn in for a second term in Kinshasa.  He reportedly promised to safeguard national unity, as tanks were deployed in the capital to prevent protests.  Mr Kabila's inauguration went ahead after the country's Supreme Court upheld his victory in November's disputed presidential election.  Opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi maintains he won the poll and says he will swear himself in on Friday.  The elections were the first to be organised locally since the end of a devastating civil war in 2003, which left some four million people dead.  The BBC's Thomas Hubert in Kinshasa says Mr Kabila, 40, took the oath of office in the presidential compound, in the presence of a few thousand supporters.  Our reporter says a 21-gun salute echoed around the empty streets of the capital as President Kabila took his oath in front of the Supreme Court and received symbols of power from traditional chiefs such as wooden statues and a leopard's skin.  The government declared a public holiday for the inauguration, while the opposition called for strikes in Kinshasa and other cities.  Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was the only foreign head of state present - our reporter says this is a sign of the discomfort generated by widespread irregularities in Mr Kabila's re-election. Mr Mugabe sent troops to back Mr Kabila's father, Laurent, during the conflict in DR Congo.  All ambassadors in the country were summoned to attend the inauguration or risk being made persona non grata.  Taking his oath of office, Mr Kabila pledged to allow himself to be guided only by the general interest, ""the respect of human rights to concentrate all my efforts to promote our common well-being and peace"".  DR Congo is two-thirds the size of Western Europe and is rich in minerals, but it has hardly any roads or railways. After years of mismanagement and conflict, living standards in the country were recently found to be the lowest of 187 countries surveyed by the UN.  Our reporter says the mention of revising the mining code is unlikely to go down well in the West.  The foreign minister of former colonial power Belgium cancelled plans to attend the ceremony. Congolese affairs analyst Theodore Trefon says that Western nations often follow Belgium's diplomatic lead over DR Congo.  Regional powerhouse South Africa said it would send its Foreign Minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, after describing the elections as ""generally OK"".  Along with the opposition, local and international electoral observers denounced widespread irregularities in November's presidential poll.  Mr Tshisekedi, 79, who enjoys strong support in Kinshasa, has called on civil servants and the security forces to take orders from him, rather than Mr Kabila.  He has also said he is offering a reward for the capture of Mr Kabila. An aide of Mr Kabila said the move was ""criminal"".  Mr Tshisekedi led the campaign for democracy under former leader Mobutu Sese Seko, but these were the first elections he has contested.  He boycotted the last poll in 2006, organised under the auspices of the United Nations, after claiming they had been rigged in advance.  As well as Kinshasa, Mr Tshisekedi enjoys a lot of support in the diamond-rich, central area of Kasai.  Mr Kabila has been president since 2001 following the assassination of his father.  Last week, Mr Kabila admitted there had been mistakes in the electoral process, but said no poll was 100% perfect and he rejected concerns that the results lacked credibility.  The US-based Carter Center, which sent observers to the election, said the vote was too flawed to be credible.  The US state department called for a review of irregularities and the EU described parts of the election process as ""chaotic"".  However, the African Union described the elections as a success."
4,"On the 1 November Hartlepool's Ritchie Humphreys played his 200th consecutive league game for the north-east club.  Having played three more league games since then - before Tuesday's home game with Colchester - Humphreys is now just a mere 198 games away from breaking the all-time record.  The holder of that record is Harold Bell, who between 1946 and 1955 played 401 consecutive league games for Tranmere Rovers.  Having turned 28 last week Humphreys thinks Bell's feats might be beyond him, but he has now set his sights on the record of Matt Holland, who between 1996 and 2003 played 286 league clubs with Bournemouth and Ipswich.  Since joining Hartlepool from Cambridge United in the summer of 2001, Humphreys has missed just two games for the club - a couple of LDV cup matches - when he was rested.  Modestly Humphreys says his ""quite proud"" of his record, attributing his achievement as much to good fortune as anything else.  ""You have to have a lot of luck with injuries,"" Humphreys told BBC Sport.  ""When you've got a game on a Saturday and then on Tuesday sometimes a dead leg might be enough to keep you out.  ""I don't tend to get booked so I haven't had a suspension - maybe I'm not tackling enough! - and importantly the managers that I have had here have kept faith with me.""  Since making his debut for Wednesday as an 18-year-old a decade ago Humphreys has suffered just one serious injury.  That came in March 2001 after he had left Wednesday the previous month to join Cambridge.  In his sixth game for Cambridge away at Luton he broke a bone in his foot and did not play again until the start of the 2001/2002 season when he made his debut for Hartlepool in the 1-1 draw with Mansfield.  Being versatile has helped Humphreys as well - this season he has played much of it at left-back, after Hartlepool's three first-choice defenders in that position picked up injuries.  Humphrey's believes his record might also have something to do with the influence of Paolo di Canio, Pavel Srnicek and Emerson Thome, who played with him at Sheffield Wednesday during the 1990s.  ""When the foreign players started to arrive at Hillsborough we subsconsiously picked up so many things from them.  ""The way they trained, the way they looked after themselves, refuelling at the right time, eating at the right time and drinking plenty of water.  ""All those things help you to recover quickly. And when you are playing four games over the Christmas period it's important for you to warm up and down properly.  ""Paolo was a fantastic pro, who trained as he played; Pavel was the ultimate professional and a really good athlete; while Emerson had a fantastic fitness level and looked after himself really well.  When Humphreys broke through into the Wednesday side as a 18-year-old he played in the England Under-21 side alongside Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Emile Heskey.  Those three went on to become full England internationals and still play in the Premiership, but Humphreys has no bitterness over the way his career has developed.  ""To be truthful I wasn't good enough at that level and to be honest I don't think I will ever play again in the Premiership.  ""If I was good enough to be in the Premiership I would be there.  ""Having said that I love doing what I do. This is my 10th season as professional.  ""I love the day-to-day ethic of being a player, of going in and training and playing. I wouldn't swap it for anything else in the world."""
5,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has made his first major state appearance since he had a suspected stroke last year. TV pictures showed him attending a parliamentary session where he was re-elected as North Korean leader. The session coincides with a separate announcement that North Korea is to revise its constitution. No details have yet been given, but there is speculation that the changes might be linked to who succeeds Mr Kim. He has no obvious successor, and rumours of his illness last year led to international concerns about the country's long-term stability. Mr Kim arrived in the Supreme People's Assembly to a standing ovation from his fellow ministers. He was wearing his trademark khaki military suit, but he appeared considerably thinner and older than the last time he was seen in public nine months ago. ""Having comrade Kim Jong-il at the highest post of our country again is a great honour and happiness,"" a newscaster said on state-run television. Mr Kim, 67, has ruled the impoverished nation of 24 million with absolute authority since his father's death in 1994. Mr Kim's suspected stroke last August kept him out of the public eye through a series of important anniversary events, and is believed to have caused a delay to the parliamentary elections. In recent weeks, North Korean media have released video images of Mr Kim touring farms and factories, in what analysts say was a strategy designed to show he was fit and well before the parliament vote. Some observers suggest that even Sunday's rocket launch was timed for maximum propaganda value ahead of the parliamentary session. Mr Kim was confirmed in his third term as the country's leader Analysts say Mr Kim received a domestic boost from the launch, despite widespread foreign criticism of what was seen as a disguised missile test. State television broadcast a lengthy paean to Mr Kim on Thursday, a day after tens of thousands of North Koreans rallied in Pyongyang to celebrate the rocket launch. But the UN Security Council has been debating whether North Korea should be punished. Japan and the US are pushing for a UN Security Council resolution which would reinforce and possibly extend existing sanctions against North Korea, applied in the wake of the country's nuclear test in 2006. But China and Russia have been more cautious, saying they are yet to be convinced Pyongyang broke any rules. North Korea has warned that ""strong steps"" will follow if the UN does takes action. A recent report in North Korea's communist party newspaper said Mr Kim was ""choked with sobs"" that the money spent on the launch could not be used for the people's basic needs - but added that they would understand.     "
6,"""Tyneside flats"" appealed to two London architects so much they are now building the first new versions in Newcastle since World War One. But what are they?  At first glance it could be a standard row of terraced houses. The giveaway is the neat pairs of front doors - one leading to the ground floor, the other opening onto stairs to the flat above.  ""You always had to go up and down the stairs to answer the door,"" remembers Esmee Telford, who lived in Sandyford in the 1940s and '50s. ""That got to be a bit of a chore.""  Her father, a woodwork teacher with a ""mechanical mind"", ran a cord through hooks down the stairs to the front door latch. ""Pull the string"" became family code for ""open the door"".  ""If it was a stranger you had to whip downstairs quickly,"" Mrs Telford says. ""It looked a bit rude if they just opened the door and there was nobody there.""  By the mid 1800s Tyneside's industry was booming and its population growing. Old-fashioned houses meant for single, middle-class families were filling up with multiple tenants. Conditions were unsanitary and disease was common.  ""When building bylaws came in in the 1860s this was the local response,"" says Simon Taylor, an architecture investigator for English Heritage.  With separate floors and staircases there was ""no communication between them whatsoever, internally or externally"", he says. The back yard, divided in half, had separate coal houses and private outside toilets.  It was an ""ingenious solution"", affordable for the tenant and, with ""high density rental incomes"", profitable for the landlord, he says.  ""It was a time when the sordid grotty back-to-backs that were being built in the 1850s were outlawed in most parts of the country,"" Mr Taylor says.  England's ""elite and ruling classes"" were finally beginning to care about the health of their workers.  Land was often sold on the condition only properties with not more than two households were built. Restrictive covenants still exist in some Tyneside flat deeds, limiting the number of families allowed and forbidding extensions to encompass more. Who would now enforce these, or receive any penalty for breaking them, is no longer clear.  ""It was a time when building bylaws were brought in across the country for the first time, which actually regulated how houses were designed and where and when they could be built and how many people could live in them and how densely congregated they could be,"" Mr Taylor says.  While Leeds and Bradford were modifying their back-to-backs, the Tyneside solution ""stacked dwellings one on top of the other"".  By 1900 half of all homes being built were Tyneside flats. Made to last and easy to extend and adapt, they are still popular.  So much so that a new development in the Ouseburn valley is recreating them - albeit with balconies, gardens and two floors per property. The outside toilets are long gone.  Architects Cany Ash and Robert Sakula were attracted by the double front doors and getting rid of common areas ""that no-one looks after properly"".  ""We're trying to build high-density without going high,"" says Mr Sakula. He is surprised the ""rather brilliant concept"" did not spread further.  People who have lived in the originals tell stories of oddly-placed bathrooms, chilly extensions and either loving or hating your neighbours.  Heather White has lived ""on this side of the street"" for 25 years - a telling turn of phrase that speaks volumes about a community used to living within doors of relatives, often moving little more than a few hundred yards on marriage.  Families often occupied a pair of flats, with parents in one and grandparents in the other. Whether it was the flats themselves, or the way they kept communities close, the result was a lasting affection.  ""The only way I'll come out, is out the door, feet first,"" Mrs White says. ""In a box.""  You were brought up with noise - either below you or above you - and got used to it, she says. Andy Hughes could hear his 92-year-old neighbour snoring through the floor - perhaps preferable to the noises emanating from the flat below Pam Kirkup.  As a child in the 1950s she remembers an older woman - teeth and husband ""mislaid"" - bringing home new friends from the pub.  ""There was usually lots of raucous laughter and some noises I didn't really understand,"" she says. ""I know my mother used to tut a lot and raise her eyes to the ceiling.""  Oz Taylor remembers being frightened to walk around for fear of annoying the landlady downstairs, who ""couldn't mind her own business"", and having to switch to teabags when she complained their loose leaves were blocking her drains.  As for the old outside loo - he used that to store his drop-handlebar bike.  In the 1900s a landlord might own two flats and either live in one or rent out both. It was only when people started buying them individually that the issue of who was responsible for what emerged.  The common solution is now reciprocal freeholds, with each flat owner, in effect, the other's landlord.  First built in Gateshead and then Newcastle, Tyneside flats spread to Ashington, Sunderland, Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Hartlepool and Berwick, though not in such huge numbers.  Similar styles could be found in Edinburgh and London, though neither were exactly the same, Mr Taylor says and the Tyneside flat remained ""overwhelmingly a Gateshead/Newcastle phenomenon"".  ""It is not entirely clear why flatted housing was not adopted earlier elsewhere,"" he says.  ""The Tyneside flat form was simply a special type - the result of local planning ingenuity when elsewhere, especially in the south and London, builders unimaginatively continued to build existing types of house, even though they were too expensive for individual households to rent outright and would have been divided from the outset.  ""People do take them for granted in this part of the country. We need to understand that they are something that no-one else has."""
7,"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has little resemblance to South Korea.  They share the same land area, but there the similarities end.  There are about 25 million North Koreans (making it the world's 48th most populous country), compared with the South's 48 million people.  Some of the starkest differences concern the earning power of ordinary Koreans.  The South has a per capita income of $20,000 (Â£13,000), while in the North it is about $1,000 (Â£644).  As North Korea publishes few statistics the actual size of the country's Gross Domestic Product is only a guesstimate.  In fact, the economy may have contracted slightly in the last two years, after several years of growth. But in terms of total GDP, the size of the economy is almost the same as that of pre-war Iraq.  Before 1945, South Korea was a largely agricultural country, while North Korea was very industrial.  The situation has reversed, with only about 2% of South Korea's GDP coming from agriculture compared with about 20%-25% of North Korea's.  But the North, as you'd expect in a centrally-planned economy, still has heavy industry, and also a mouth-watering array of mineral resources, including gold, iron ore, and a range of rare earths and uranium.  In many ways, North Korea was the most successful communist country, with a rapid - for a communist country, at least - rate of growth and a high rate of party membership.  In fact, the North's per capita GDP was higher than that of South Korea until the mid 1970s. Everywhere are reminders of this successful communist state in terms of organisation, fading infrastructure and decaying industry.  Does any of this present a business opportunity?  The first problem, unless you are a Chinese citizen, is the difficulty in getting a visa.  Once in North Korea, you are then faced with the problem of the ""US blockade"", as the North Koreans call it.  Dealing with this trade embargo is certainly a learning curve - as I know from personal experience.  In 1994, the US Treasury department seized $4,000 of my money while it was on its way to pay the monthly expenses of my consulting office in North Korea.  The money was released a few years later, during a period when there was a slight thawing of relations between the US and North Korea under the administration of President Bill Clinton.  The lesson? Never use dollars which have to clear through the New York banking system.  In order to avoid this kind of incident, the North Koreans adopted the euro as the foreign currency of record early last decade.  This was fine at the beginning of the last decade when the dollar and euro were at parity. But it pushed up prices for foreigners doing business in Pyongyang as the euro began to appreciate.  Most, if not all, Western multinationals avoid direct business with North Korea because they fear US Treasury penalties.  However, for smaller businesses, whether from the West or, more likely, China, life is easier.  Still, most products with a potential dual use - that is, military use - including computers, cannot legally be exported from most countries.  Fortunately for North Korea these restrictions, which date back to the Cold War are not enforced in China. For a small business, North Korea is full of opportunities.  Thousands of Chinese businesses have moved into North Korea, and are making money.  A handful of Western companies have done the same, with small scale restaurants and other businesses, including hotels, mobile phones and micro-credit operations.  The opportunities will increase if North Korea can improve the economy.  North Korea, with its dedicated and inexpensive workforce, and ample natural resources, has the potential to grow if it is allowed to access world markets and capital sources freely.  But the new collective North Korean leadership"" faces several tasks.  The first is how to feed all of the people all of the time.  Enormous efforts have gone into increasing the output of food since the ""Arduous March"" of 1995-1999, a period of economic strife when an estimated one million North Koreans died (though many would put the number three times higher).  In the 1990s, the World Food Program and many non-governmental organisations rushed to help the North.  But in 2011 there is donor fatigue, and the South has failed to supply food or fertilizer since President Lee came to power in 2008.  The US is returning to provide aid this year. North Korea needs development, not aid, but currently western governments punish the North by giving only emergency aid at best, and not development aid.  The second task is to continue the reforms of 2002, which introduced market forces on a limited scale.  A recognition that market forces could feed people, when the public distribution system could not, was grudgingly accepted.  However, the subsequent growth of a differential in wealth and individualism alarmed conservatives within the DPRK.  A third task is to deal with the US economic blockade. The blockade is now enforced by UN sanctions, imposed when North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon.  North Korea believes that its nuclear weapons are its major defence against a hostile world, and will abandon them only when the US signs a peace treaty that ""ends"" the Korean War of 60 years ago.  North Korea says it is still in a state of armistice.  The fourth task is to encourage experiments like the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a collaborative economic development with South Korea.  Here, some 123 South Korean firms use inexpensive and skilled labour provided by more than 48,000 North Koreans to produce products for the Korean market and beyond.  A meeting was held this month between businessmen from the South and officials in the North to discuss how to expand the complex.  Finally - and the priority for the new North Korean leadership - will be the task of continuing the rebuilding of limited industries and major buildings in Pyongyang to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the regime's founder and self-styled Great Leader  It is a rebuilding programme that the leadership believes will assure the North Korean people that their country is becoming an advanced country.

8,"Q: What was the oil-for-food programme?  It was a $60bn (Â£32bn) scheme which was supposed to allow Iraq to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies with the proceeds of regulated oil sales, without breaking the sanctions imposed on it after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  The programme - set up in 1996 - aimed to relieve the suffering of ordinary Iraqis under the sanctions.  It was formally ended in 2003 after the US-led invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.  Q: What is the scandal?  The scandal emerged in early 2004, after an Iraqi newspaper published a list of about 270 people including UN officials, politicians and companies it alleged may have profited from the illicit sale of Iraqi oil during the OFF programme.  Later, US Senate investigators concluded that the Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussein made about $13.6bn from selling oil to neighbour states keen to breach the sanctions.  Billions more were allegedly earned through kickbacks and illegal surcharges on services and goods provided by companies contracted under the OFF programme, the Senate investigators found.  The UN has come under fire as the organisation responsible for administering the OFF programme.  Q: What is being done about the scandal?  A number of investigations have been launched.  The UN set up a three-member independent inquiry, chaired by former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul A Volcker, and also including Justice Richard Goldstone of South Africa and Professor Mark Pieth of Switzerland.  The panel's findings, condemning mis-administration and corruption in the programme, were published on 7 September.  Separate inquiries are under way in the US Senate and by the Iraqi interim government.  The US justice department has also set up a criminal investigation. So far, one man has pleaded guilty and three others have been indicted.  Q: Who has been implicated?  Politicians and UN officials from dozens of countries are suspected of receiving bribes to lobby against sanctions on Iraq's behalf.  International firms - mainly from the Middle East and Russia, but including some large US oil companies - are also being investigated.  A key figure is the former head of the oil-for-food programme, Benon Sevan. In February, an interim report by Mr Volcker's panel into the scandal said he had tried to allocate oil sales from Iraq to one company.  Following that report, both Mr Sevan and another official, Joseph Stephanides, were suspended. Both men deny the charges.  In August, a third report said Mr Sevan took nearly $150,000 in cash bribes.  The panel recommended that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan lift Mr Sevan's UN immunity for the ""purposes of a criminal investigation"".  It emerged last year that Mr Annan's son Kojo received payments from a company, Swiss-based Cotecna, which was contracted to monitor the OFF programme.  Mr Volcker's panel found ""significant"" questions over the integrity of Kojo Annan's dealings.  However, it found no evidence that the secretary general had made personal gain or influenced the Cotecna contract.  It did find that Kofi Annan failed to exert control over the programme.  ""The report is critical of me personally and I accept its criticism,"" he said, adding that the findings were ""deeply embarrassing to us all"".  Q: Has anyone been charged over the affair?  Samir Vincent, 64, an Iraqi American, was the first to be charged in the US justice department inquiry. In January 2005, he pleaded guilty to being an illegal agent for Saddam Hussein's government and helping to skim money from the programme.  Three more people were indicted on 14 April 2005. A Texas businessman, a Bulgarian and a British citizen are accused of taking part in an alleged scheme to pay bribes to the former Iraqi regime as part of the programme.  Alexander Yakovlev, a Russian former UN procurement officer, was accused by the Volcker panel of accepting bribes of close to $1m. He has pleaded guilty and pledged to help investigators.  Q: What has the US Senate inquiry found?  A report from a Senate committee has claimed that two politicians, British MP George Galloway and former French government minister Charles Pasqua, were given allocations of oil by Iraq under the OFF programme.  They both deny the charges.  On 16 May 2005, a second set of reports accused Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and former presidential aides Alexander Voloshin and Sergei Issakov, of receiving allocations.  But none of the committee's evidence suggests direct contacts between the three Russians and the Saddam Hussein regime over oil. Nor does the committee present evidence that any of the five men actually received any financial gain.  The US committee says that it has found documents in the Iraqi oil ministry listing contracts in the OFF programme. It has also interviewed senior Iraqi officials including former Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan and former Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.  Q: What outside factors are affecting the investigations?  Correspondents say the scandal must be seen within the context of the row that erupted between the US and the UN over Iraq, and the debate over the future of the UN.  ""Neo-conservative"" opponents of the UN in the US have held up the scandal as a symbol of the UN's incompetence and last December Republican Senator Norm Coleman - who chairs the main Senate committee investigating the scandal - became the first to call on Mr Annan to quit.  The controversial new US ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, said the Volcker report ""unambiguously rejects the notion that business as usual at the United Nations is acceptable"".  But UN supporters say it is inevitable that in running such a large operation mistakes occur.  Correspondents point out that billions of dollars are unaccounted for in the Iraq reconstruction fund set up to replace the OFF programme - which was under the stewardship of the US-led coalition in Iraq.  Mr Annan has also alleged that that the US and UK turned a blind eye to oil smuggling by Saddam Hussein's regime, something they reject.  The UN chief suggested London and Washington had inadequately policed UN sanctions against Iraq, enabling the regime to earn huge amounts in illegal deals."
9,"At the beginning of the 1960s, an event occurred that changed the sound of Britain's radio forever - the growth of 'pirate' radio stations. What started out as a protest for the freedom to play music ended up challenging the British government and the BBC's rather conservative radio broadcast output. If it had not happened it is possible that commercial radio as we know it may not have been allowed to develop.  At the beginning of the 1960s there were only three national radio stations in Britain, all run by the BBC. In the spirit of public service broadcasting, the government insisted that all programmes were respectable, hopefully educational and impartial - hence the BBC was not allowed to broadcast commercials for fear that advertisers or sponsors could try to influence the quality or content of the programmes.  At the start of the 1960s the BBC played very little contemporary or 'youth-orientated' music, partly because those in charge of output were quite disparaging about pop music, and partly due to existing agreements with the Musicians Union regarding the employment of musicians, which limited the amount of recorded music that could be played. So in the evening, if you wanted to hear pop music you'd have to retune to Radio Luxembourg a commercial station that broadcast from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, in mainland Europe. As it was originally granted a low-powered internal frequency and was not licensed to broadcast to Britain, it paved the way for British audiences to appreciate the later pirate radio stations.  At that time a young Irishman, Ronan O'Rahilly, was managing pop singer Georgie Fame, who had managed to get a few songs into the 'hit parade' with only limited airplay on the larger channels. Ronan decided to start his own station - and realised that the best way to get around the restrictive broadcast policies of the UK would be to transmit his programmes offshore.  A radio station broadcasting from a ship may have seemed an odd idea but Ronan O'Rahilly became inspired by Holland's Radio Veronica, which had been broadcasting since 1960. O'Rahilly was fortunate in that his father was a successful businessman who owned the port of Greenore in Ireland. Through his record company, Ronan raised finance for his first ship. Subsequent would-be pirate broadcasters had to form companies to afford the ships, maintain them and pay a crew and DJs. To do this they ran them, as Radio Luxembourg was run, with commercials or sponsors.  Although the station traditionally celebrates its launch over Easter each year, 27 March, 2004 marks the 40th Anniversary of the first test transmission from Radio Caroline. The station was officially opened by Simon Dee two days later on Easter Sunday 29 March, 1964.  The first ship - which was placed in the North Sea three-and-a-half miles from Felixstowe - was the 763-ton former passenger ferry MV Fredericia. On 27 April, 1964, she was joined by a smaller ship, the 370-ton coaster MV Mi Amigo, which was home to Radio Atlanta. Atlanta and Caroline were at first rival stations, though after a few weeks the two stations merged. The Fredericia sailed around the coast into the Irish sea to become Caroline North while the Mi Amigo stayed in the North Sea as Caroline South. In November 1964, the Mi Amigo was joined there by a major rival. The 780-ton American minesweeper MV Galaxy, housing Radio London.  Other ships soon followed, and stations were also set up in the old wartime forts that still stood in the Thames estuary; the result was that the British coast was soon surrounded by music. The young DJs, the majority of them just into their mid-twenties, were admired for their daring defiance of the government and rebellious choice of playlists. They played upon the 'romantic pirate' image, although in reality they were sometimes homesick or seasick. For audiences exposed to our 'Digital Age', it's difficult to explain the spirit of adventure and challenge that the pirates conveyed. Being confined on board ship for weeks at a time they developed a happy camaraderie that they communicated through their broadcasts to the listeners, a feeling of togetherness and freedom that the land-based stations could not capture. It lasted for over three years, until the Government's Marine Offences Act made it illegal for ships to broadcast within British territorial waters. The pirates were forced off the air on 14 August, 1967. All, that is, except one: Radio Caroline continued alone for another seven months.  Public reaction and loyalty to the pirate stations had not been lost on the BBC however. On 30 September, 1967, the BBC launched Radio 1 as part of a shake-up of their radio stations and, unofficially, as a replacement for the ships. Many of the DJs who'd made their names on the pirate stations were hired for the new station, as well as some from Radio Luxembourg. These were already well-known to the listeners and were experienced at 'personality' broadcasting. BBC programmes had always been presented by announcers who addressed an audience; the DJs aimed to speak to individual listeners.  BBC local radio started on 8 November, 1967, with Radio Leicester. At first, all BBC Local Radio broadcasts were on FM only. Currently, the BBC operates all local, licensed non-commercial radio stations in the UK.  The commercial stations tend to be independent of each other, although some have combined after their inception; some larger areas of the country are now covered by companies that broadcast the same program to the whole area. They have been regulated by the Radio Authority, which changed to OFCOM (the Office of Communications) at the end of 2003.  The Isle of Man has been legally broadcasting commercial radio on Manx Radio since June 1964 on FM and October 1964 on AM. It had its own internal government but needed a licence from the British government, which was reluctantly granted. The Republic of Ireland has always had its own different system of broadcasting. The first legal local commercial radio station within Britain - LBC - started on 13 October, 1973, followed a week later by Capital. The first national commercial station, Classic FM, started in September 1992. It broadcasts mainly classical music, competing with BBC Radio 3 for listeners.  Virgin 1215 AM is, at the time of writing, the only national commercial pop music station. It launched on 30 April 1993.  There are, of course, hospital and student radio stations in the UK, though these broadcasts can only be heard inside the buildings or campuses they serve.  Radio London's Ed Stewart currently broadcasts on Sundays on Radio 2.  Johnnie Walker started his radio career with Radio England before he 'jumped ship' to become one of Radio Caroline's most famous DJs. He is now back on Radio 2's Drivetime show, after an eight month break due to serious illness, from which he has now recovered.  The DJ who opened Radio 1, Tony Blackburn, was voted 'King of the Jungle' in the 2002 round of 'reality' TV programme I'm A Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here. He spun discs on both Caroline and London. Since 1988 he has been on commercial radio, but is now back with the BBC on local station, BBC London.  Many other DJs from the ships still broadcast on various stations all over Britain. All of them owe a huge amount to Ronan O'Rahilly's dream.  Broadcasting from ships did continue at various times throughout the 1970s. Radio Northsea International broadcast off the Dutch coast from the MV Mebo 2, a 630-ton general cargo ship, and Caroline continued on the Mi Amigo, until she sank in the Thames estuary on 20 March, 1980. From 1983 to 1991, broadcasts on 558 FM came from the MV Ross Revenge, a 978-ton Icelandic trawler, 223 feet 4 inches in length, which the Caroline organisation still has and are in the process of restoring. The present plan is to continue occasional broadcasts from the ship for 28-day periods, using a restricted service licence and to arrange tours at other times, but this could change in the future. The 558 frequency now carries Spectrum Radio a local commercial station for London's multi-ethnic community.  Radio Caroline herself is still broadcasting, legally now, via Sky, Worldspace digital and the Internet, still 'Keeping the Dream alive' as it says in the song which became Caroline's theme tune in the 1970s.  During Easter 2004, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pirate Broadcasting, BBC Essex broadcast a week of programmes from the lightship LV18 half a mile from the Norwich coast. DJs from the 1960s who took part included 'Tatty' Tom Edwards, Roger 'Twiggy' Day, Keith 'Cardboard Shoes' Skues and Mike Ahern 'Your DJ Michael A', all former Radio Caroline DJs, along with Pete Brady (formerly of Radio London) and Dave Cash (formerly of 270 and Radio London).  Most of the Radio Caroline DJs had nicknames. Dave Lee Travis had more than most: as well as 'DLT' he was known as 'your dinner record spinner' on the Radio Caroline lunchtime programme. During his time on Radio 1, he became the 'Hairy Cornflake' on the morning Programme and also 'The Hairy Monster'.  Sadly some of the DJs from the 1960s are no longer with us.  For pictures and information on the ships visit The Broadcasting Fleet. For pictures of many of the DJs who worked on them, plus much more information, visit The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame.  For all the main events in the history of UK Radio see the Timeline. The information in this Entry is correct at the time of writing, but stations and schedules are constantly changing."
10,"It is no surprise that Tunisia's prisons are overcrowded as it's relatively easy to end up there. In one prison I met two women who were locked up for smoking a joint.  The dreary reception hall of Menouba prison lies between the gates of freedom and captivity.  From one corner, the squeal of a young woman being embraced by her visiting family echoes through the room.  From another, a muffled sob interrupts the tapping rain.  The tearful woman paces, then sits, and puts her head in her hands. She appears broken and lost.  She tells me her name is Arouseya Mezouzi and she misses her three children who are now staying in an orphanage.  It is her third week in detention on charges of smoking marijuana - locally dubbed ""zatla"". Her husband is also in jail for drugs.  ""In most countries, they don't have these cases against drugs - it's just us,"" Arouseya says.  ""It's destroyed so many people. A whole family has been destroyed for something like this? Children are in orphanages, schooling is disrupted, and their future is lost,"" she says.  A short walk away, there's a new facility that could be mistaken for any nursery.  It is seen as one example of improvements being made here.  In the living room there's a TV, some toys scattered around and children taking their first steps.  The youngest amongst them is a one-month-old girl wrapped in a blanket, lying wide-eyed in a crib.  This house provides a safer space for incarcerated mothers who have their children with them, and for others, like Amel, who are expecting.  She has been detained for five months on accusations of forging a signature, and says she is innocent.  ""Cases like forgery should be resolved quickly by experts on the matter.  ""The slow judicial process affects us. Why should my child be born here? They call this place a solution, but it's still prison,"" she says.  Another prisoner, Amira - not her real name - seemed more fearful of her neighbourhood finding out that she was in prison and pregnant, than she was of the state that jailed her for ""smoking half a joint"".  She tells me her family has told everyone that she had moved to a different city.  She says she was so shocked by her incarceration she took medication for it.  ""I'm not an addict, but even for those who are, I wish the state would rehabilitate them rather than sentence them for a year.  ""You don't leave prison feeling like you were taught a lesson - I'm going to be harder on myself and on society.""  Many of the women I met would be walking around freely in most countries.  There is anger here towards a justice system that appears to be failing them.  Menouba prison is reputed to be bigger, better, and more comfortable than most.  Prison director Jamila Smida tells me: ""It's not like before, where you just lock up the prisoners and leave them indoors.""  On the day we visited, she was overseeing the end of a three-day event to expose the inmates to arts and theatre.  She tells me reforms have been successful here because it's not overcrowded like other jails.  She is quick to dismiss any suggestions that they are running over their 420 capacity.  This jail houses first-time drug offenders, pre-trial detainees and others serving long-term convictions for crimes like theft, murder, and terrorism.  We were only allowed inside one cell, in Bloc B of the main prison.  The inmates' laundry hung to dry across a small, wet courtyard that swept a cold wind across the four halls surrounding it.  The room houses the so-called ""working women"" of the prison; the cooks, the bakers, and the tailors. There were 35 prisoners in it.  ""We get out more, but it's not like that for the ones in the other rooms, it's completely different,"" Samira explains.  She's the room boss - a privileged prisoner who takes care of her cell mates.  It's a stuffy and slightly damp room with two long rows of bunk beds draped in colourful bedding.  Trinkets of personal belongings occupy the narrow space between each bed. Some are gossiping, having their lunch, or smoking.  ""In this room we don't have women convicted of terrorism, but the others do.  ""They don't get along, they think in a certain way and we think differently.  ""But in prison you have to deal with them. We don't have a choice,"" Samira says.  Critics see that lack of choice as a potent combination that could turn cannabis smokers into hardened criminals.  The prison director says that fixing the prison system is not just in their hands.  ""It's in the sentencing, and in the judiciary,"" Ms Smida insists.  Tunisia's government is under pressure to jail fewer people and provide more rehabilitation opportunities.  There is a serious, albeit slow, ongoing debate amongst lawmakers to amend some criminal laws and reform the judiciary.  Until that happens, the changes seen in Menouba prison will make little difference."
11,"Curries are now a regular part of life in the North West. Rusholme's curry mile in Manchester has offered a diverse range of foods from the Asian subcontinent since the 1960s. But did you know that curries were eaten in the North West as early as the 18th century? Inside Out went to John Rylands library in Manchester and tracked down recipes dating back to 1769, written by the house keeper at Arley Hall in Cheshire. Tony Morris researches the history of the nation's favourite dish The first curry houses in the North West were cafes, set up for the men who had come to the region from the Asian subcontinent in the 1950s to work in the textile mills. The Tandoori Kitchen was one of the first curry restaurants to open on Rusholme's famous Curry mile on Manchester's Wilmslow Rd. The Hussain family opened the business 35 years ago, originally serving Persian food to immigrant workers. In recent years there's been a revolution in curry eating. The image of men behaving badly, gulping downing super-hot curries with several pints of lager, are long gone. Today, a trip out for a curry is a posh affair, with some of the country's top chefs cooking up sophisticated dishes of complexity and variety. A far cry from a Saturday night curry from a foil container! The Shere Khan opened its first restaurant on Wilmslow Road in Manchester 16 years ago. Chief executive Nighat Awan says she wanted the restaurant to be bright and modern, away from the ""flock wallpaper"" image that other restaurants had at the time. Her empire has now grown to include restaurants and takeaways across the North West, and a Shere Khan range of food products which are exported across the world. So what are the Shere Khan's top tips for making that perfect curry? One of the hardest things to get right for the amateur cook is the 'spice factor'. If your sauce is too hot, try cooling it down with a touch of yoghurt. On the other hand, if it isn't spicey enough, simply add some chopped green chillies. Better still, try out the Shere Khan's very own special recipe for chicken balti. 1 knob of butter or tablespoon of vegetable oil Add peppers and fry with chicken for three to four minutes. Garnish with coriander and serve with basmati rice and naan bread."

The bank's governor, Gideon Gono, has announced 10 zeros will be lopped off the Zimbabwe dollar, making 10bn dollars now equal to one dollar. Only last week, the government introduced the Z$100bn note. South Africa's Thabo Mbeki is visiting Harare after crisis talks between government and opposition were halted. He will meet President Robert Mugabe, whom the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) have accused of stealing the election earlier this year. We would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks... so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy    Mr Mugabe said he wanted the talks to succeed but warned that ""sometimes compromise is difficult"". The BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg says it has emerged that President Mbeki held a meeting in the South African capital, Pretoria, on Tuesday with the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai. Mr Mbeki, the lead mediator on the Zimbabwe crisis, has said the two sides are determined to reach an agreement within a two-week time-frame at the talks in a secret location near Pretoria. But opposition sources said the talks have reached deadlock. After the currency announcement, Mr Mugabe warned the country's businessmen in a televised address to stop profiteering or face emergency measures. ""If you drive us more than you have done we will impose emergency measures, and we don't want to place our country in a situation of emergency rules, they can be tough rules you know,"" Reuters news agency reports him as saying. Mr Mugabe blames Zimbabwe's economic problems on white businessmen and Western sanctions, rather than his own policies. The latest currency announcement is another desperate attempt by Mr Gono to stabilise Zimbabwe's collapsing economy, our correspondent says. ""The Zimbabwe dollar will be redenominated by a factor of one to 10, which means we are removing 10 zeros from our monetary value. Ten billion dollars today will be reduced to Z$1... effective from 1 August,"" Mr Gono said in a television broadcast. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The high rate constrained the operations of the country's computer systems, with computers, calculators and banks' cash machines not able to handle transactions in billions and trillions of dollars, he added. The new Z$100bn (under $2, Â£1) note introduced last week is not enough to buy a loaf of bread. Inflation is officially running at more than 2,000,000%, but many analysts believe the true inflation figure is at least 9,000,000%. A BBC reporter in Harare said that on the day he recently went shopping, a tray of 24 eggs went up from Z$375bn to Z$600bn. Mugabe to be accepted as president MDC to take a few minor ministries International community to drop sanctions and help kick-start economy Full text of the Memorandum of Understanding[39KB] So far this year, Zimbabwe has been forced to print Z$100m, Z$250m and Z$500m notes in rapid succession, now mostly worthless. Mr Mugabe said he would like a speedy conclusion to talks with the MDC so ""we can focus in the future our attention around our economy"", AFP news agency reports. The negotiations began last week after Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai met for the first time in a decade. Mr Tsvangirai pushed Mr Mugabe into second place in the first round of voting on 29 March but he pulled out of a 27 June run-off election after a wave of deadly attacks against his supporters. The MDC says that more than 120 of its supporters have been killed, some 5,000 abducted and 200,000 forced to flee their homes after being attacked by ruling Zanu-PF militias and security agents.

13,"He said the ethnic Albanian majority and the Serbs remained diametrically opposed on the final status issue.  In international law, Kosovo remains a province of Serbia, but has been administered by the United Nations since Serb forces were ousted in 1999.  ""I don't see the parties moving on the status issue,"" Mr Ahtisaari told a parliamentary seminar in Helsinki.  However, he said there had been progress on technical matters since direct talks began in Vienna in February. He has been overseeing the talks.  Last month the Serbian parliament adopted a new constitution declaring Kosovo to be an integral part of Serbia, despite the ethnic Albanians' demand for independence.  Serbia will now put the constitution to a referendum vote at the end of this month, to be followed by elections.  Failure to come to an agreement puts the onus on Mr Ahtisaari to come up with recommendations to be approved by the UN Security Council, the BBC's Balkans expert Gabriel Partos says.  There is widespread expectation that the eventual settlement will give Kosovo independence - albeit of a conditional kind, under strict international supervision to protect the Serb minority.  Because of this, the Serbian government would like to put off the decision on Kosovo's future, Gabriel Partos says.  But Mr Ahtisaari said he had received no instructions for a slow-down from the six-nation Contact Group spearheading the UN's efforts to find a settlement.  Contact Group diplomats have told the BBC any discussion about a revised timetable would be purely hypothetical at this stage.  But they say if, and when, Serbia does set a date for elections, the Contact Group may reconsider the timing."
14,"A legal battle sparked by the discovery of the world-famous 5,300-year-old ""Iceman"" known as Oetzi in northern Italy in 1991 has finally been settled.  German hikers Erika and Helmut Simon found the remains, but officials in the north Italian province of Bolzano had refused an adequate finders' fee.  A court ruled against the province in 2006, and it has finally agreed to pay 150,000 euros (Â£120,000; $216,000).  But the award has come too late for Mr Simon, who died four years ago.  The money will go to his 71-year-old widow.  The row began in earnest in 1994, when the Simons turned down a ""symbolic"" reward of 10 million lire (5,200 euros).  Italian law stipulates a finders' fee of 25% of a discovery's value. Oetzi has brought many visitors to Bolzano - and millions of euros as a result.  In 2006 a court ordered the provincial government to ''properly'' compensate Erika Simon.  But lawyers for the council contested the ruling.  They argued that the council had footed the bill for the excavation and provided an air-conditioned, temperature-controlled home for the iceman.  On Monday, the council finally agreed to the Mrs Simon's claim, saying the reward was in recognition of the couple's discovery and the tourist income it attracts.  The BBC's Mark Duff, in Milan, says Oetzi has brought nothing but bad luck to many of those involved in his discovery.  Mr Simon died in a mountaineering accident in 2004, and six other people linked to the discovery in some way have died in apparently mysterious circumstances.  This has all led to talk of a Tutankhamen-like ""curse of Oetzi"", our correspondent says.  Oetzi, named after the Oetz Valley where he was discovered, was one of the great archaeological finds of recent years.  He was still wearing goatskin leggings and a grass cape, and his copper-headed axe and a quiver full of arrows were lying nearby.  At first, it was thought he died from cold and hunger, but researchers were eventually able to establish that he died from injuries sustained in a conflict.  Oetzi was about 159cm tall (5ft 2.5in), 46 years old, arthritic, and infested with whipworm.     "
15,"The base at Bagram is used by special forces and as a prison The hangars and buildings of Bagram airbase are a distinctive sight on the horizon on the drive from the Afghan capital, Kabul. Originally built by the Soviet military during its invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, Bagram is now the main base for the US-led coalition force. The base can hold up to 10,000 troops. It is under US command and control but forces from other coalition nations also use the facility. Bagram also houses the main prison facility for people detained by US forces across the country, which can hold up to 1,000 prisoners. The base, situated around 40km (25 miles) north of Kabul on the Shomali plain, has been occupied by the coalition forces since the toppling of the Taleban regime in December 2001. It is officially known as Bagram Airfield by the US military. It is served by a runway of more than 10,000ft (three-km), where large cargo and bomber aircraft can land and which has been repaired by coalition troops. It played a key role during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, serving as a base for troops and supplies. The airfield gets its name from the nearby Bagram village. Many of the village residents now work at the base. Some of the troops situated there are involved in combat, but many supply the thousands of other US forces spread around the country. Day and night, there is constant movement at the base. Huge transport aircraft land or take off from there, and all kinds of helicopters can be seen, from Apache gunships and Chinook transport helicopters to Blackhawks. Despite the heavy security, four detainees, described as ""dangerous enemy combatants"", escaped from Bagram in July 2005 - the first time any prisoner has managed to do so, the US military said. Like the inmates of the US prison at Guantanamo in Cuba, the detainees were denied the right to challenge their detention in US civilian courts. When this was overturned for Guantanamo detainees the US justice department sought to continue the practice in Bagram. The prison at the Bagram air base houses senior al-Qaeda suspects This was partially overturned in April, 2009 when a US judge, John Bates, decided non-Afghan prisoners held by American forces in Afghanistan could challenge their detention in the US. People detained at Bagram are mostly held in an anonymous-looking building deep in the heart of the base, correspondents say. Those who have been inside describe it as being divided up into cages in some areas, with walled-off rooms in others. During the course of 2005, the US military gradually released many of those held there under a joint Afghan and US-backed reconciliation scheme known as the Takhim-e-Solh or ""Strengthening Peace"" programme. Despite this initiative, after US President Barack Obama began his term in 2009 the justice department said around 600 people, including Afghan nationals and foreign al-Qaeda suspects, remained detained at Bagram. The US is further planning to construct a $60m (?36m) new prison designed to hold 1,100 more people. It is rare for attacks to take place on Bagram base but a rocket attack killed two US soldiers in June, 2009. In February 2007 a suicide bombing outside the base during a visit by then US Vice-President Dick Cheney killed more than 20 people.     "
16,"Singer Sir Cliff Richard will face no further action over allegations of historical sex abuse, prosecutors say.  The Crown Prosecution Service said it had decided there was ""insufficient evidence to prosecute"".  Sir Cliff said he was ""obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close"".  But he said his naming by the media, despite not being charged, meant he had been ""hung out like live bait"".  Four men claimed offences took place between 1958 and 1983, the CPS said.  It is understood that one of the complainants intends to use the Victims' Right to Review Scheme to appeal against the decision not to bring charges.  In a statement, Sir Cliff said: ""I have always maintained my innocence, co-operated fully with the investigation, and cannot understand why it has taken so long to get to this point.""  He criticised the ""high-profile fumbling of my case from day one"".  ""Other than in exceptional cases, people who are facing allegations should never be named publicly until charged,"" he said.  ""I was named before I was even interviewed and for me that was like being hung out like 'live bait'.  ""It is obvious that such strategies simply increase the risk of attracting spurious claims which not only tie up police resources and waste public funds, but they forever tarnish the reputations of innocent people.""  Sir Cliff Richard's anger, mixed with relief, seeps from every line of his 366-word statement. The phrase ""hung out like live bait"" stands out - and it's designed to.  Sir Cliff wants to stop the reputations of other people being tarnished by publicity about allegations that haven't crossed the threshold for a prosecution, let alone been proven.  Although it's not police practice to identify suspects who haven't been charged - unless there are exceptional circumstances - names occasionally leak out and journalists sometimes discover the details through other routes.  A statutory ban on naming would put a stop to that. But would it allow sex offenders to get away with their crimes?  The concern is that if they hadn't been named in the media at an early stage, thereby emboldening other victims to come forward, some recently convicted celebrities would have got away with it.  Last year an independent investigation concluded that South Yorkshire Police should not have released ""highly confidential"" information to the BBC about a planned search of Sir Cliff Richard's home.  BBC film crews, including one in a helicopter, filmed the raid in August 2014.  In a statement, South Yorkshire Police apologised ""wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused"" to Sir Cliff by the force's ""initial handling of the media interest"" in its investigation.  The investigation is estimated to have cost ""in the region of Â£800,000"" including staffing costs, the force added.  ""Non-recent allegations are, by their very nature, complex and difficult matters to investigate and can take a considerable amount of time,"" it said.  ""We appreciate that waiting for a conclusion will undoubtedly have caused additional distress. However, it is in the interests of justice to investigate such matters thoroughly.""  Prosecutors received the full evidence file from police on 10 May, and BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said that meant the CPS had made its decision ""quite quickly"".  But he said the CPS had been working alongside the police for many months and there would now be ""serious questions for the police about why this has taken so long"".  He also said there would be ""serious questions for the BBC in terms of its coverage"".  Commenting on the claims against Sir Cliff, our correspondent said this ""isn't necessarily the end of the matter"", as the CPS maintains it must ""keep every case under review"" and every complainant has the right to a review of a decision not to bring charges - as one has said he will.  Responding to questions about the BBC's coverage, a BBC spokesman said: ""We applied normal editorial judgements to a story that was covered widely by all media and have continued to report the investigation as it developed including the CPS's decision today - which is running prominently across our news output.""  Conservative MP David Davis said Sir Cliff's case was ""another high-profile arrest which resulted in no prosecution"".  ""It is time for a complete review of police procedures surrounding high-profile sex abuse cases, and the publicity surrounding these cases,"" he said.  ""Whilst it is important to protect victims and maximise the chances of a successful prosecution, this must not result in the gratuitous destruction of people's reputation.""  Broadcaster and campaigner Nick Ross agreed with Sir Cliff's comment that he was ""hung out like live bait"".  He said police faced an ""impossible dilemma"" trying to balance justice for victims with ""trying not to have a witch hunt against people, some of whom are celebrities"".  But he said police did not handle Sir Cliff's case correctly, both in terms of Sir Cliff's name being released and by taking ""so long"" over the investigation.  Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck said he had not expected the CPS to come to any other decision when it came to his friend.  Tarbuck was released without charge in 2014 after his arrest over allegations of historical child sex abuse.  He said: ""I have known this man since we were 19 years of age, that's a long time, and I knew him then as a nice fellow.  ""I can tell you so many things about him, he's a decent human being. And why keep him waiting all this long?"""

The former colonel was born in what is now Ukraine, but was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1894.  He escaped the German invasion of Poland in 1940 and worked as a gardener in Scotland before moving to Cumbria.  His son-in-law Richard Thomas, of Birks Fold, said he and other members of the family had seen the highly decorated veteran at the Boarbank Hall nursing home before he died on 6 December.  Mr Thomas said: ""We saw him on the day he died. He had a very colourful and eventful life.""  Mr Dydynski studied law at the University of Vienna, but when World War I broke out joined the Polish Army and saw service in the war between Russia and Poland in the 1920's.  He was still with the army when Germany invaded Poland in 1939, but eventually managed to escape to Britain.  He spent months in hospital after falling ill on New Year's Eve 2003 and breaking his hip.  The colonel was born in Lwow on 19 July, 1894, and moved to Sedbergh from Edinburgh in 1993 with his second wife Dorothy, who predeceased him.  The family said his long life was down to his positive outlook and, until recently, a daily half glass of Guinness.  He was called up to the Austrian Infantry in 1915 and became a sergeant before going to Montenegro and Albania, where he fought against the Italians.  He married in 1924 but his first wife later died. He married again in 1946.  Family from Poland, Britain, the US, Australia and France are due to attend a funeral service at Sedbergh Parish Church on 12 December."
18,"Toshiba is to start making products that can play Blu-ray discs.  The decision marks a big change for the electronics firm which was the prime mover of the rival HD-DVD format.  Blu-ray and HD-DVD went head-to-head to see who could dominate the burgeoning market for movies produced in the high definition format.  The format war was effectively won in early 2008 when the Blu-ray camp won the backing of all four of the biggest movie studios.  Blu-ray was largely developed by Sony. Its efforts to dominate the HD market were also helped by sales of the PlayStation 3 which has a Blu-ray player built-in.  Toshiba said it would begin production of stand alone Blu-ray players as well as drives for PCs and laptops. Its first products are likely to be ready for the end of 2009.  The Japanese firm also said it would join the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) - the industry body which oversees development of the high-definition format.  ""In light of recent growth in digital devices supporting the Blu-ray format, combined with market demand from consumers and retailers alike, Toshiba has decided to join the BDA,"" the Japanese firm said in a statement."
19,"Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment said its own website - Utube.com - had to be moved five times after millions of inadvertent hits made it crash.  The Ohio-based firm has now filed a claim in the US district court.  It says it wants YouTube to stop operating or alternatively pay for it to create a new web domain.  Universal Tube said the cost of hosting its site had grown significantly in the last two months, and claims that it had lost business because customers have had trouble accessing its site.  In August, the company, founded in 1985, got 68 million hits on its site which eventually crashed.  ""We were there first by 10 years,"" Universal Tube's president Ralph Girkins told the Associated Press news agency.  ""We've had to move our site five times in an effort to stay ahead of the YouTube.com visitors.""  YouTube, launched in February 2005, has grown quickly into one of the most popular websites on the internet.  It has 100 million videos viewed every day and an estimated 72 million individual visitors each month.  Last month it was bought by Google for $1.65bn (Â£883m) in shares.  It has more than 60 staff including co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen."

Maces are used in courts as a symbol of judges acting with the authority of the Crown, though they may have been used as weapons to protect them in the past.  It is 150 years since one was formally presented by a monarch.  In 1856, Queen Victoria presented the exchequer mace to the Court of Session and it remains in use.  The mace received in Wednesday's ceremony will be used by Lord Hamilton in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It was designed and crafted by royal silversmiths Hamilton and Inches in Edinburgh."
21,"                        The sounds were recorded in Mongolia       From BBC Science reporter Dr Chris Riley in San Francisco A Croatian astronomer thinks he has cracked a meteor mystery that has baffled the scientific world for over two centuries. He has managed to record what he believes are the elusive, instantaneous sounds made by shooting stars as they crash through the Earth's upper atmosphere. The display of shooting stars was amazing, says Dejan Vinkovic The extraordinary thing about these noises is that the observer on the ground hears them at the same time as the meteor appears overhead. On the face of it, this would seem impossible because it would require the noises to break the sound barrier! These strange sounds are very rare He made the recordings during last November's Leonid meteor storm and presented his findings to a conference in San Francisco this week. Dejan Vinkovic, currently at the University of Kentucky, conducted his enterprising experiment on an expedition to Mongolia. He was joined by colleagues Slaven Garaj, Goran Zgrablic and a number of others from the University of Zagreb. They were perfectly placed to record any sounds that might accompany the Leonids, the shower of shooting stars that are seen when the Earth plunges through the dust debris left by Comet Temple Tuttle as it circles the Sun. Since Biblical times, stories have been told of a low thunder-like noise instantly accompanying bright shooting stars. But it was not until 1784 that proper research into the phenomena began. Sir Charles Blagdon, the then Secretary of the Royal Society, collected eyewitness accounts of a bright fireball that rushed across the UK. He noted surprisingly that all the witnesses had heard the accompanying rumble at the same time, regardless of where they were in the country. The team endured freezing temperatures while they waited for the Leonids Blagdon concluded that it could not be a proper acoustic sound as it had travelled too fast. But he knew of no principle that could account for what his witnesses had heard and declared that future observations would no doubt explain it. But it was to take almost two centuries to explain the principle when a huge fireball streaked across Australia promoting lots of reports of the ""instant"" sound phenomenon again. This time astronomer Colin Keay gathered the eyewitness accounts and proposed that the twisting wake of the fireball might trap its magnetic field - creating very long radio waves which would travel to the ground below at the speed of light. The display of shooting stars was amazing, says Dejan Vinkovic In the lab Keay showed that such radio frequencies could produce an audible sound at ground level by interacting with anything from a tree to someone's hairstyle or pair of spectacles! He called his phenomena electrophonic sound. Generating sounds in this way is still somewhat controversial. And most astronomers believed that these instant sounds which accompanied bright meteors were just something that eyewitnesses were imagining. The proof to the contrary has had to wait until now. Away from civilisation, 20 kilometres south of Ulan Bator and battling with temperatures below minus 30 degrees centigrade, Dejan Vinkovic and his team set out to record these enigmatic X-sounds. The Microphones were buried in sealed wooden boxes ""Our equipment was not sophisticated,"" he admits. ""To protect the microphones from wind noise, we just buried them in sealed wooden boxes with a partition of aluminium or paper foil to act as a kind of drum skin. Then we just covered them in snow and waited."" Their wait was rewarded after two frigid nights when the fireballs started falling over the Mongolian steps. ""We were just chatting around midnight and suddenly a few happened,"" recalls Vinkovic. ""Then they just came, brighter and brighter. We stood there amazed. It was complete madness. I've never seen fireballs so bright. You could see your shadow - night turned to day."" Vikovic estimates they saw more than 30 fireballs in about five hours. But this was a freak night that probably will not be repeated in our lifetimes. ""And the accompanying sounds are very rare,"" he stresses. Remember, it is the thud in the middle of the clicks that is the electrophonic sound ""The average person may expect to hear only one electrophonic fireball in a lifetime, as long as they spend most of their night hours outside."" Alternatively you could click on our RealAudio recording. The sound to listen out for is a thud heard in between a couple of sharp clicks.         "
22,"On the 1 November Hartlepool's Ritchie Humphreys played his 200th consecutive league game for the north-east club.  Having played three more league games since then - before Tuesday's home game with Colchester - Humphreys is now just a mere 198 games away from breaking the all-time record.  The holder of that record is Harold Bell, who between 1946 and 1955 played 401 consecutive league games for Tranmere Rovers.  Having turned 28 last week Humphreys thinks Bell's feats might be beyond him, but he has now set his sights on the record of Matt Holland, who between 1996 and 2003 played 286 league clubs with Bournemouth and Ipswich.  Since joining Hartlepool from Cambridge United in the summer of 2001, Humphreys has missed just two games for the club - a couple of LDV cup matches - when he was rested.  Modestly Humphreys says his ""quite proud"" of his record, attributing his achievement as much to good fortune as anything else.  ""You have to have a lot of luck with injuries,"" Humphreys told BBC Sport.  ""When you've got a game on a Saturday and then on Tuesday sometimes a dead leg might be enough to keep you out.  ""I don't tend to get booked so I haven't had a suspension - maybe I'm not tackling enough! - and importantly the managers that I have had here have kept faith with me.""  Since making his debut for Wednesday as an 18-year-old a decade ago Humphreys has suffered just one serious injury.  That came in March 2001 after he had left Wednesday the previous month to join Cambridge.  In his sixth game for Cambridge away at Luton he broke a bone in his foot and did not play again until the start of the 2001/2002 season when he made his debut for Hartlepool in the 1-1 draw with Mansfield.  Being versatile has helped Humphreys as well - this season he has played much of it at left-back, after Hartlepool's three first-choice defenders in that position picked up injuries.  Humphrey's believes his record might also have something to do with the influence of Paolo di Canio, Pavel Srnicek and Emerson Thome, who played with him at Sheffield Wednesday during the 1990s.  ""When the foreign players started to arrive at Hillsborough we subsconsiously picked up so many things from them.  ""The way they trained, the way they looked after themselves, refuelling at the right time, eating at the right time and drinking plenty of water.  ""All those things help you to recover quickly. And when you are playing four games over the Christmas period it's important for you to warm up and down properly.  ""Paolo was a fantastic pro, who trained as he played; Pavel was the ultimate professional and a really good athlete; while Emerson had a fantastic fitness level and looked after himself really well.  When Humphreys broke through into the Wednesday side as a 18-year-old he played in the England Under-21 side alongside Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Emile Heskey.  Those three went on to become full England internationals and still play in the Premiership, but Humphreys has no bitterness over the way his career has developed.  ""To be truthful I wasn't good enough at that level and to be honest I don't think I will ever play again in the Premiership.  ""If I was good enough to be in the Premiership I would be there.  ""Having said that I love doing what I do. This is my 10th season as professional.  ""I love the day-to-day ethic of being a player, of going in and training and playing. I wouldn't swap it for anything else in the world."""
23,"Since the Cursing Stone was placed in Carlisle, the city has suffered floods, foot-and-mouth disease, job losses and a goal famine for the football team.  Now the city council is considering destroying the stone, to try to bring the run of bad luck to an end.  But Kevin Carlyon, high priest of the British White Witches, says that would only increase belief in its power.  He said: ""A curse can only work if people believe in it. I think at the moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse.  ""Most of us have some kind of superstition, and I think that destroying the stone would be very bad for Carlisle because it would feed that power.  ""The council could make things a lot worse for the city.""  The 14-tonne stone is inscribed with a 1,069-word 16th Century curse which was first invoked by the Archbishop of Glasgow against cross-border families, known as the ""reivers"", blamed for stealing cattle, rape and pillage.  It was designed by artist Gordon Young whose own ancestors were reivers, and who believes recent events have nothing to do with the stone.  He said: ""I think there are enough rational people on the council to make sure there's no chance of it being destroyed, but the fact that they are considering that is truly amazing.  ""Having been brought up in Carlisle, I can remember factories catching fire, flooding, unemployment, and consecutive relegations by Carlisle United. It just doesn't stack up for one second.""  The council is meeting on Tuesday evening do discuss the fate of the Cursing Stone, which would cost the council about Â£7,500 to remove."
24,"Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which controls much of Somalia, has released a joint video with al-Qaeda, announcing the two groups have merged.  Al-Shabab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, known as Mukhtar Abu Zubair, said he ""pledged obedience"" to al-Qaeda head Ayman al-Zawahiri.  The two groups have long worked together and foreigners are known to fight alongside Somali militants.  The announcement comes as al-Shabab is under pressure on several fronts.  Africa Union troops supporting the forces of the UN-backed government have taken control of the capital, Mogadishu, while both Kenya and Ethiopia have sent forces into Somalia to push back the Islamists.  Al-Shabab, however, still controls many southern and central areas of the country.  However, correspondents say al-Shabab's policy of banning many foreign aid agencies from areas it controls during the region's worst drought in 60 years has lost the group some of its popular support.  The United Nations says that although the famine in Somalia is officially over, a third of the population still needs urgent feeding.  BBC Somali editor Yusuf Garaad Omar says the merger of al-Shabab and al-Qaeda has the potential to change the dynamics of the conflict in Somalia.  During the 15-minute Arabic-language video posted on jihadist websites, Zawahiri said the move was ""good news"" for al-Qaeda.  Analysts say the announcement helps boost al-Qaeda after its leader Osama Bin Laden was killed last year.  ""Al-Qaeda needs to project power and influence, particularly given its own operational impotence,"" Australian analyst Leah Farrall told Reuters news agency.  ""Al-Shabab's acceptance under the al-Qaeda umbrella probably came with permission from Zawahiri for the group to launch external operations against the West.""  This week, the London-based Royal United Services Institute think-tank warned that about 50 Britons were training with al-Shabab and could return to attack the UK.  Last week, William Hague was also in Mogadishu, the first visit by a British foreign secretary in 20 years.  The UK government is holding a conference in London on 23 February to try to find a political solution to Somalia's problems, and tackle piracy and extremism.  Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991 and since then, has been convulsed by conflict."
25,"In the weeks before the Blur vs Oasis chart battle, one song seemed to be drifting out of every speaker in the land - the Boo Radleys' Wake Up Boo!  It was a sudden flush of success for the Liverpool band, already seven years into their career, who had become critical darlings without ever quite making it into the pop mainstream.  But thanks to Wake Up Boo!, the band - led by singer Sice and featuring guitarist Martin Carr, bassist Timothy Brown and drummer Rob Cieka - the Boo Radleys found themselves, unwillingly as it turned out, at the epicentre of Britpop.  A decade on, Carr, the band's principal songwriter, looks back on Britpop's legacy with mixed feelings.  ""I tried to have nothing to do with what was being called Britpop. Our whole career was spent trying not to 'fit in'. We just carried on doing what we had been doing.  ""I didn't like most of the new bands or the flag-waving. I didn't like New Labour or idolise Paul Weller and I hated media-generated movements within music.""  The Boo Radleys had already released three albums before Wake Up Boo - Ichabod and I, Everything's Alright Forever and 1993's Giant Steps, which had been proclaimed album of the year by music weekly Melody Maker.  Giant Steps - which spawned the alternative hit Lazarus - was an ambitious, stylistically varied record which had elements of dub and trip-hop alongside the fuzzy guitars and distorted vocals which had become something of a hallmark.  Released on Creation Records - also home to Oasis - Wake Up Boo! featured a much clearer, pared-back pop sound more in keeping with the kind of guitar rock suddenly in sway. It went all the way to number one.  But despite suddenly being lumped in with the likes of Oasis, Blur and Pulp, Carr did not feel any particular camaraderie.  The Britpop scene had originally been dubbed ""the scene that celebrated itself"", and Carr was often featured in the music press gossip columns as something of a staple in the bars and clubs.  ""We had been partying since the late 1980s,"" he says. ""I went to a couple of the big Oasis concerts, primarily to take drugs and hang out.  ""We didn't sell masses of records; we sold relatively little compared to others. We were never ones for going to the right clubs or hanging out with the rich and stupid.""  Carr himself is not one to stick on Oasis' Definitely Maybe or Blur's Parklife to relive the mid-90s.  ""I never give it a moment's thought. I certainly don't play any records from around that time except for hip-hop records.""  But Carr disagrees with the notion that the British music scene was celebrating a sense of Britishness.  ""It was about record companies trying to make money. Bands weren't given a chance to learn and grow; it was all about having hits,"" he says.  'Everyone had given up'  ""I was gutted when Creation signed to Sony, I'd never wanted to be on a major label and we were under much more pressure after that. It was also a chance for everyone to get away with more jingoism than usual.  ""American music was great then, I loved all the Wu-Tang stuff and Pavement and Richie Hawtin.""  Little more than a year after Wake Up! was released, The Boo Radleys released a denser follow-up, C'mon Kids, which harked back to their more experimental roots.  At the time they were accused of trying to ditch fair-weather fans.  ""I'm not even going to answer that,"" Carr says.  ""It was a bunch of songs that I had written that we recorded; it only seems inaccessible because everyone had given up and started listening to dreary pub rock records. Some things haven't changed.""  After the release of 1998's Kingsize, another record more in tune with the early years of the band's career, the Boo Radleys parted company. Carr now records and plays live under the moniker Brave Captain.  ""I'm much happier. Much poorer but much happier and I wouldn't go back."""
26,"About 200 olive trees have already died from the contamination.  Qalqilya's problems highlight the fears of both Palestinian and Israeli environmentalists that Jewish settlers are regularly polluting the land, air and water of the occupied territories.  In the West Bank village of Beit Duqqu, residents complain that neighbouring Jewish settlements have been polluting their farmland for around 15 years.  And a kilometre outside the village stands a huge pile of their own rubbish lies smouldering half-burnt.  The refuse is dumped and burnt there - next to ancient Roman ruins - because Jewish settlers in nearby Hadasha settlement demanded that Palestinians stop using a more suitable site which necessitated them passing close by the settlement, Beit Duqqu residents say.  Villagers also say children have fallen ill after swimming in a local stream polluted by untreated sewage pumped from another settlement high on a nearby hilltop - Givat Zeev.  ""It's had a big impact on my livelihood,"" said local farmer Farouk, ""I've had to use lots of my savings to buy insecticide and each year the problem is getting worse""  The villagers say they have tried to meet the settlers to resolve the problem.  ""We tried to make three or four meetings with the leader of the settlement but he refused to talk about it and said 'we don't care',"" says Beit Duqqu community leader Akrima Ray.  Environmentalists maintain that the Israeli authorities are not doing enough to prevent pollution in the West Bank.  In April, Israel gave the go-ahead to settlers to convert a former Palestinian quarry into a dump for industrial waste from Israel and Jewish settlements in the West Bank.  A 2004 report by Friends of the Earth Middle East found that only 6% of Israeli settlements adequately treated their sewage.  The settlers account for only 10% of the population of the West Bank, yet produce 25% of sewage pollution, the study found.  The group also found that sewage from settlements was polluting the underground water aquifer that serves both Israel and the West Bank.  The Israeli Ministry of the Environment which is responsible for enforcing environmental standards in Israeli settlements only took steps against 14 of more than 60 colonies illegally discharging sewage, the FOEME report says.  This is partly due to the difficulties of enforcement in areas under Israeli military control.  Yet some measures have been taken against the West Bank's largest settlement, Ariel.  According to environmentalists, criminal proceedings were launched against Mayor Ron Nachman over the lack of sewage treatment facilities serving the town.  Despite this, the mayor recently criticised Palestinians on their own environmental record.  In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Friends of the Earth he cited possible Palestinian pollution of Gaza as a reason for the government to abandon its controversial plan to disengage from the area.  The settlers themselves say they have taken their own measures to protect the environment.  The Municipal Environmental Associations of Judea and Samaria was set up by settler councils to promote environmental awareness in the West Bank.  Their stated goals include a commitment to find solutions to sewage treatment problems and to work with the Palestinian Authority on environmental issues.  They also require environmental impact surveys be carried out on new building by settlers in the West Bank.  The Palestinian Authority itself has also been targeted by environmentalists for not doing more to prevent water pollution, despite the difficulties posed by the security situation.  Campaigners are calling for the PA to raise awareness of environmental issues as many Palestinians dispose of their sewage in cesspits that leak into the water table.  It is not just the settlers homes that are a source of pollution in the West Bank.  The industrial and manufacturing businesses that they operate are also a source of pollution, Palestinian environmentalists say, as many do not conform to Israeli standards.  According to environmentalists Barkan industrial zone, close to Ariel settlement, is responsible for producing untreated sewage and solid waste that is then buried on Palestinian agricultural land.  ""We have no problem working with people living in Israel but the settlers have a different mentality,"" says Dr Nadil Khateeb of the Water & Environmental Development Organisation in Bethlehem.  He fears that the settlement industries could cause serious health problems among Palestinians in the future.  ""Industrial waste can contain heavy metals, you only need a small amount to pollute a water supply and that could cause cancers.""  ""The problem is definitely getting worse because nothing on the ground has changed."""
27,"Escalating ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan has prompted tens of thousands of ethnic Uzbeks to flee the country.  A third day of fighting in the south of the country has claimed nearly 100 lives, officials say.  Witnesses speak of Kyrgyz men shooting ethnic Uzbeks and setting property alight; a BBC correspondent in the city of Osh has heard heavy gunfire.  Kyrgyzstan's interim government has urged Russia to send in troops to help quell the violence, but Moscow says it has no plans to intervene.  A battalion of paratroops would be sent to protect Russian facilities in the country, Interfax news agency reported, quoting a security source.  Both Russia and the United States have military bases in the north of the country.  We tried to get to the centre of Osh but had to retreat because of heavy shooting. We drove through several Uzbek neighbourhoods and the situation there is extremely tense. We saw groups of ethnic Uzbek men who didn't have guns from what we saw - just sticks and knives. They said that they hadn't slept for three days. They didn't have any food. I saw smoke on the skyline as more properties were set on fire. At the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border there are hundreds of women and children trying to make their way to safety. There is no international presence here and people are desperate for help.  Kyrgyzstan's interim government extended a state of emergency to cover the entire southern Jalalabad region, as ethnic clashes spread there from neighbouring Osh.  One resident in Jalalabad said fighting was going on throughout the city.  ""At the current moment, there are shoot-outs going on in the streets,"" he told the AFP news agency by telephone.  ""There is a veil of smoke covering the whole city,"" another resident told AFP. He said buildings on fire included a shopping centre.  Without international assistance there are fears the interim authorities will struggle to contain the conflict, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie in Osh reports.  She says buildings are ablaze in Osh - television pictures show street after street of burnt-out buildings and black smoke billowing in the air.  President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who was ousted in April and now lives in Belarus, has denied accusations from the government that he is involved in the unrest in order to derail a 27 June constitutional referendum and elections scheduled for October.  The south of Kyrgyzstan, an ex-Soviet Central Asian state of 5.5 million people, is home to an ethnic Uzbek minority of almost one million.  The violence has prompted tens of thousands of people to head for the nearby border with Uzbekistan.  Uzbek emergency officials said at least 30,000 people had crossed the border from Kyrgyzstan. One official told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that 75,000 had entered Uzbekistan.  The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received similar reports.  Ethnic Uzbek eyewitnesses told our correspondent at a border crossing with Uzbekistan that gangs of armed Kyrgyz had been marauding through neighbourhoods, killing residents and burning homes.  One woman pleaded for help: ""We need food, we need water, I have got two sons and they are little and I need water and food to survive.""  There have also been reports of Kyrgyz casualties.  One Kyrgyz family the BBC spoke to by telephone said an Uzbek boy armed with a gun shot dead three Kyrgyz men who were approaching them.  Pakistan says one of its citizens, a student, has been killed in Osh and it is investigating reports that 15 others have been taken hostage.  More than 1,000 people have been wounded in the violence, the authorities say. Some reports say the casualty figures could be much higher.  It is not clear what sparked the latest unrest.  According to local reports, fighting broke out between rival gangs and developed into gun battles late on Thursday.  In recent weeks, several incidents had prompted fears of inter-ethnic violence between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz.  The clashes are the worst ethnic violence to hit southern Kyrgyzstan since 1990, when several hundred people were killed. Kyrgyzstan was then part of the Soviet Union, which sent in troops to quell the unrest."
28,"Atoc says record demand has led to the need for investment Train operators are calling for widespread expansion of the rail network in England, with 14 extra lines and about 40 new stations proposed. The Association of Train Operating Companies said there was a need for expansion to cope with rising demand. It said the expansion, which would cost Â£500m and possibly reuse lines closed under the 1960s Beeching cuts, could serve more than 1m extra passengers. Any decisions on future expansion rest with government and Network Rail. Atoc chief executive Michael Roberts said: ""Record passenger numbers and rising demand require us to plan for the long term, while climate change and population growth make it vital that in doing so, we adapt the rail network to meet tomorrow's needs. Any expansion should be publicly-owned and free from the chaos and profiteering of the privatised franchise system    ""Providing attractive new services and easier access to the rail network will encourage passengers to switch to rail from other, less green, modes of transport. ""We have established that there is a strong business case for investment to bring a number of towns back on to the rail network. ""Now we need to safeguard these routes and develop the detailed case for investment."" The Beeching report by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s resulted in the railway network being cut by a third, closing 2,000 stations and 5,000 miles of track. The Atoc report says 40 towns not currently on the rail network could benefit from the 14 new lines. It says the new stations could be operational within five to 10 years. Any decision on whether any of the plans get the go-ahead would be taken by local and regional government, Network Rail and the Department for Transport. Atoc argues infrastructure from some of the old lines closed in the 1960s could be refurbished to form part of the new network. Freight lines could also be adapted to serve commercial routes, it said. Transport Minister Chris Mole said the government would consider the findings of Atoc's report. ""The government's priority is to bring about changes, such as capacity improvements, which will deliver benefits for rail passengers now,"" he said. ""For the longer term, we will work with local authorities who want to improve links to the rail network, and will plan to make funding available from 2014 for successful schemes which demonstrate value for money."" Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers said the research was ""interesting"" and made ""an impressive case"" for reopening disused rail lines. She added: ""Conservatives recognise the value of these transport corridors, which is why we have called for a moratorium on building on any disused rail lines still in public ownership. ""Certainly, housing growth and the need to cut emissions from transport and tackle road congestion means that all political parties should look seriously at the ideas put forward in this report, though it is clear that the state of the public finances will put constraints on what is possible over the next few years."" Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said: ""RMT has repeatedly called for an expansion of rail services to create green jobs and green transport options as part of our campaign for a people's railways. ""However, any expansion should be publicly-owned and free from the chaos and profiteering of the privatised franchise system.""    The areas which would be served by the 14 possible new lines identified in the report are: â¢ Aldridge and Brownhills in the West Midlands â¢ Leicester to Burton in the East Midlands     "
29,"The Reds beat AC Milan in last season's final but, because they finished out of the Premiership's top four, were not guaranteed entry in 2005-2006.  Uefa's executive committee changed its rules on Friday to allow Liverpool in.  ""We wish to express our thanks to those who supported us and campaigned,"" said chief executive Rick Parry.  Rafael Benitez's men will now face a first qualifying round first leg on 12 or 13 July and a second leg on 19 or 20 July.  That means they will now probably have to cancel scheduled friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Cologne.  And if successful in the first qualifying round, they will probably also have to cancel a pre-season tour of Japan, where they are due to play Shimizu S-Pulse and Kashima Antlers.  Uefa chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson told BBC Radio Five Live the decision by the 14-man executive committee was unanimous.  ""Unanimous means that everybody is supporting it. By definition, that is also the case here.  ""There were no discussions actually on where they should enter the competition because everybody was of the opinion they should be given the opportunity but they have to start from the beginning.  ""They could not be allowed to get into the 32 for example.""  But while there is joy for Liverpool, there has been disappointment for Manchester City.  The Uefa Cup spot which Liverpool had earned for finishing fifth in the Premiership will not transfer to another English club so City, who would have been next in line, will not be in Europe.  And it is likely that Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton will be unhappy at potentially sharing the television money with one other club.  Uefa spokesman William Gaillard admitted splitting the pot five ways rather than four will be ""a burden on the other English-based clubs"".  If Manchester United or Everton fail to reach the group stage but Liverpool do the pot could go back to being split four ways - but anyone involved from England will still get less because of the Reds.  If four English clubs reach the group stages, Chelsea will get 40%, Arsenal 30% and two out of Manchester United, Liverpool and Everton will get 15% each.  If all five get through Uefa will think again.  But while the others will feel hard done by, even Liverpool have suffered in comparison with other Champions League winners.  Normally the title holders get 30% of the money for their country if they are not also the domestic champions.  Meanwhile Uefa insists the saga which has dogged it since Liverpool finished fifth domestically and then won the Champions League will never be repeated.  ""The Uefa executive committee decided to amend the regulations for the future editions of the Champions League, so that the holders will have the right to defend their title and therefore qualify automatically,"" said a statement on the organisation's website.  The new system is in marked contrast to 2000, when Real Madrid won the Champions League but finished outside of Spain's qualification positions.  On that occasion fourth-placed Real Zaragoza were relegated to the Uefa Cup.  Reacting to the news, Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann told BBC Radio Five Live: ""It's tremendous news, great for the club.  ""We've still got two or three weeks to prepare, which should be enough to get in physical shape to cope with the pre-season schedule.""  And Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick added: ""We thank the Uefa executive committee and especially its president Lennart Johansson for listening to the strength of the argument for Liverpool's entry.  ""We always said that this was an exceptional situation which required an exceptional solution. For the very first time, one country has five teams in the Champions League and we have to be delighted at that.  ""We believed there were very strong sporting reasons for Liverpool to defend their title, not least after that fantastic final in Istanbul. That view has prevailed, and rightly so.""  Sports minister Richard Caborn added: ""I'm delighted that Uefa have decided to allow Liverpool to defend their trophy.  ""This is a triumph for common sense and the spirit of sport. I look forward to the start of the new season and the British clubs making a powerful impact again.""  But some Liverpool supporters are unhappy with the decision.  Les Lawson, spokesman for the Liverpool International Supporters' Club, said: ""Uefa has been caught with egg on their faces over this because the FA put the first four in the Premiership into next season's tournament.  ""It means Uefa has had to sort it out and they have done the minimum possible. They have treated their own champions with contempt.  ""It is a disgrace. Liverpool are the top team in Europe because they are the holders and have beaten Europe's best. They are being treated like TNS or other very small clubs.  ""To be told they have to start in the first qualifier is wrong and a real kick in the teeth.""  And Alan Kennedy, who scored the winning goal for the Reds in the 1981 final against Real Madrid, added: ""Coming in at the early stages disregards where Liverpool finished in the Champions League.  ""They won it, so they should be entitled to be in at the third qualifying round."""
30,"The Brazilian economy is performing far worse than expected, battered by domestic problems, the Argentine crisis and the US slowdown.  New figures showed that annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter was just 0.79%, way below forecasts of a 3% increase.  In the first quarter, annual growth was 4.28%.  Quarter-on-quarter, Brazilian GDP shrank by 0.99% - its first contraction since 1998.  Analysts say performance might improve in the rest of the year, however.  Two domestic problems lay behind the slowdown.  First, interest rates were hiked during the second quarter, in an attempt to stabilise the currency, the real, which had come under attack on the foreign exchange markets.  This helped the real, but also choked off business activity in the second quarter. Many Brazilian firms have introduced unaccustomed discounts and special offers, in the hope of stimulating sluggish demand. Second, the government introduced electricity rationing at the beginning of June, after the power sector was hit by shortages. On 13 August, Brazil and Venezuela inaugurated a new high-voltage electricity cable, which aims to help top up Brazil's power market. But the country is also at the mercy of external forces. The economic deceleration in the US, one of Brazil's biggest foreign investors and trade partners, has also put a check on economic activity. And the continuing international concerns over Argentina's solvency have had a disproportionate effect on Brazil. Since Argentina's currency, the peso, is not freely traded on the markets, investors have attacked the real as a proxy. They have also heavily sold down the Brazilian stock market, the biggest and most liquid in Latin America. The Argentine crisis has raised renewed fears of emerging-market ""contagion"", where investor panic spreads unchecked from country to country. The outlook for the rest of this year is not quite so gloomy. At the beginning of August, the government introduced a swathe of fiscal reforms in order to win a $15bn aid package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). If, as many hope, the IMF also provides emergency aid to Argentina, the current emerging-market gloom might lighten. In time, this might allow a judicious lowering of interest rates. Most economists now say that the Brazilian economy will grow by 1-1.5% in 2001, below previous expectations but substantially above current growth levels. Finance minister Pedro Malan used a year-end growth target of 2.7-2.8% when drawing up the IMF-mandated fiscal package."
31,"The Bulgarian authorities said the missile smashed into a house in the Gorna Banja district on Wednesday night.  Sofia is just 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the Yugoslav border. President Petar Stoyanov, who rushed to the scene after the blast, urged residents not to panic.  Nato spokesman Jamie Shea said the incident happened after a jet fighter was illuminated by a Serb air-defence radar.  ""A missile was fired in self-defence in response to this threat from a surface-to-air missile,"" he added. ""After the ground radar was turned off the missile strayed from its target and unintentionally landed in Bulgaria.''  Colonel Tomirko Tomanov, a weapons specialist with the Air Force Chief of Staff, said the missile was an ""air-to-surface type, AGM 88 Harm, or a high-speed anti-radar missile which could be carried by Nato's F-16 fighters"".  Three Nato missiles have already fallen in Bulgaria during the five-week air campaign against Yugoslavia, and the alliance's planes have previously violated Bulgarian airspace.  The Bulgarian army said it was unable to identify a plane which violated the country's airspace at 2141 (1941GMT) on Wednesday, shortly before the missile strike.  The plane was spotted near the town of Varshets about 50km north of Sofia.  President Stoyanov urged Nato to supply Bulgaria with sophisticated radar to identify planes. He said Bulgaria would also mark its western border with lights to help pilots.  Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev was quoted saying Bulgaria would sue the pilot of the jet which fired the missile for damage caused to the house owners.  ""There hasn't been such a drastic violation of our airspace so far,"" he added.  One resident told Reuters: ""I heard the explosion and I felt horror. For Nato it is just statistics if a missile falls in one place or another but for us it means suffering.""  The incident comes as Bulgaria's parliament prepares to debate a Nato request to use its airspace for raids on Yugoslavia.  The pro-Western cabinet backs the move, while the leftist opposition vigorously rejects it and has organised street protests.  The public is divided between a desire to join Nato and the European Union and sympathy for fellow Slavs and Christian Orthodox Serbs."
32,"Edward Heath has become the new British prime minister after a surprise victory for the Conservatives in the general election.  The result has confounded all opinion polls conducted before yesterday's election which had predicted a comfortable win for Labour.  But with all 630 seats now declared the Conservatives have won 330 seats, giving them a majority of 30. Labour have won 287 seats.  The new prime minister, Edward Richard George Heath, who has led the Conservative party since 1965, has pledged to ""restore honesty to government and integrity to politics"" and bring to an end what he referred to as ""six long years of hard labour"".  The outgoing prime minister, Harold Wilson, refused to admit defeat until the last minute.  But just after 1400 hrs today, when the Conservatives reached the required majority of 316 seats, he requested an audience with the Queen to tender his resignation.  Shortly afterwards the Queen invited Mr Heath to Buckingham Palace where she asked him to form a new administration.  Edward Heath was born in Broadstairs on 9 July 1916 and was educated at Oxford university, before becoming MP for Bexley in 1950.  A confirmed bachelor, he has a passion for yachting and classical music.  Throughout the past three weeks, during which all the party leaders have toured the length and breadth of Britain on their arduous election campaign trails, Edward Heath, 53, has consistently offered the British people a new style of government.  As well as his commitment to European unity, he has promised to reduce taxes, cut down on wild-cat strikes by updating the law on industrial relations, and give more help to the poor, the old and the sick by concentrating government subsidies on those that need them most.  As he arrived at Downing Street this evening he was given a rapturous welcome. Huge crowds, who had gathered throughout the afternoon, sang ""For he's a jolly good fellow"" and shouted ""Good old Ted.""  In an interview with the BBC, the defeated Harold Wilson said he had always admired Edward Heath although he had not agreed with many of his election tactics, including the Conservatives' attempt to ""drag sterling into the campaign.""  Devaluation of the pound has remained a controversial issue for both the main parties.  But Mr Wilson said Mr Heath would now have the strongest economic position any prime minister had taken over in living memory.  He suggested the low turn-out of voters - just 70% - may have contributed to his defeat: ""We were up against something that no-one foresaw. (...) It was a low poll and a low poll is going to count against us. All the signs were of a high poll.""  Mr Wilson and his family left Downing Street via a back door this afternoon and went to Chequers, the Prime Minister's country seat, where they will remain until they find alternative accommodation in London."
33,"Proposals to remove the large dish-shaped aerials from the BT Tower have been approved by Camden Council.  BT said it was seeking to remove the aerials because they were redundant and in a bad state of repair.  In a planning document submitted to Camden Council, the company said that some of the equipment had already become detached from the tower.  It described the loose equipment as ""a major health risk"" because of the tower's height and location.  The tower was designed to host aerials that were used to transmit microwave signals for television broadcasting and telephone calls.  However, advances in telecommunications technology have now largely replaced microwave transmissions so the large ""horn"" and ""dish"" aerials on the BT Tower are redundant.  Two dishes were removed in November 2010 for safety reasons.  The work to remove the remaining aerial equipment safely will take more than six months and is scheduled for completion early next year.  The council's approval allows temporary scaffolding and a loading platform to be constructed during the works.  The building is Grade II listed, but the council's conservation officer has confirmed that government watchdog English Heritage has accepted the need to remove the aerials on safety grounds.  BT is considering the future of the tower once the aerials have been removed.  Options include lighting, art work or signage in the aerial zone, which the planning document said ""would bring new life to the building""."
34,"Rock legends The Who have unveiled their first song in eight years as they mark their 50th anniversary.  Be Lucky includes lyrical references to Australian rockers AC/DC and French electro band Daft Punk and will be included in a double album featuring the group's greatest hits.  The band will donate royalties from the new track to teenage cancer sufferers.  One of the most influential rock bands of the 20th Century, their hits include My Generation and I Can See for Miles.  Earlier this year, surviving members Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend announced they would play a tour, which starts in the UK in November, to mark their 50 years in the industry.  Daltrey described the tour as ""the beginning of the long goodbye"".  The new track Be Lucky features the lyrics ""You wanna climb without a safety line/ AC/DC's gonna be fine,"" and a similar refrain, ""You want to climb without a safety line/ Daft Punk will tell you that it's gonna be fine.""  Daft Punk's single Get Lucky was one of the biggest hits of 2013.  Recorded at British Grove and Yellow Fish Studios, the Who track features long-time collaborators Zak Starkey on drums and Pino Palladino on bass.  In a statement on their website, The Who said: ""In keeping with their ongoing support for Teenage Cancer charities, the band have donated their royalties from the song to Teen Cancer America.""  Daltrey was instrumental in founding the Teenage Cancer Trust gigs at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2000.  In 2011, Teen Cancer America was founded by Daltrey and Townshend in the US.  In April, Daltrey was presented with the outstanding contribution prize at the Music Week awards for his work with the Teenage Cancer Trust.  The Who were formed by singer Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle in London in 1964 and were joined by drummer Keith Moon before recording their first single.  Moon died of a drug overdose in 1978 and Entwistle died of a drug-induced heart attack in 2002."
35,"Russian teen pop duo Tatu have been forced to cancel their forthcoming UK tour dates because of poor ticket sales.  They have had to cancel two arena dates just days before they were scheduled to play the shows.  The dates, at London's Wembley Arena on Friday and Manchester's MEN Arena on Sunday have been pulled by promoters because ticket sales are so low.  Both venues have capacities of over 10,000, and the concerts were understood to have sold only a fraction.  Tatu hit the top of the UK charts earlier this year with their debut single All the Things She Said.  They courted controversy by appearing to be lesbians, and dressing in school uniforms in the single's video, which drew several complaints.  The concerts were announced earlier this year despite the fact the duo - Julia Volkova, 17, and Lena Katina, 18 - had only the one hit to their name.  A spokesman for the duo's label Interscope said on Wednesday they had no details as to why the concerts had been cancelled, other than that the promoters had decided to pull them.  ""The girls will still be coming in to London on Wednesday for promotion. We hope the concerts can be rescheduled for later in the year,"" he said.  The promoter, Red Square, was not available for comment on Wednesday.  Concerts at the two venues are usually only mounted by acts who have a string of hits or much bigger fanbases.  Recent acts who have played Wembley Arena include Counting Crows, Supergrass and pop band Blue.  ""Ticket holders are advised to retain their tickets and return to the original point of purchase for a full refund,"" a spokesperson for Wembley Arena said on Wednesday."
36,"Life with the partisans behind the lines in WWII    Files released this autumn at the National Archives in Kew include one dossier showing how the Special Operations Executive - Churchill's ""secret army"" - was not disbanded at the end of the Second World War, as is commonly thought. Instead, nearly 300 agents were brought into the Secret Intelligence Service - otherwise known as MI6. Officially SOE, the organisation set up to run resistance in occupied countries, was ""liquidated"" in January 1946. SOE operatives were trained in all aspects of clandestine operations. They organised sabotage, guerrilla actions, black propaganda operations and financial warfare. They were active in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. SOE researchers had perfected secret communications and even developed weapons such as exploding rats. Training schools, like the one at Beaulieu in Hampshire, taught agents all manner of spy techniques, including how to kill an opponent with their bare hands. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. When peace came, some in Churchill's government argued that SOE could have a valuable role. Lord Selborne, the minister responsible, suggested it could be used to run clandestine operations in communist Europe and elsewhere. But the incoming Labour Government was less enthusiastic. It was Clement Attlee who oversaw its demise. The recently released file reveals the liquidation was a front. One briefing paper for the Chiefs of Defence Staff from January 1946 shows that while the ""liquidation party"" at SOE's headquarters was closing down the office, 280 of its personnel were becoming ""Special Operations Branch"". The plan was for them to be headed by ""C"" - the head of SIS - but to work independently. SOE agents were trained in secret locations around Britain However, in just a matter of weeks ""C"" - Sir Stewart Menzies - had decided that the idea of a separate branch was ""unsound"". He told the Chiefs of Defence Staff that he believed it would be better simply to merge them. Though in wartime SIS and SOE had sometimes worked well together, they were in many ways quite different. SIS had been founded in 1909, to secretly acquire intelligence. SOE - founded in 1940 - was far brasher, by the end of the war far bigger, and operated in a way that was closer to the James Bond idea of the secret agent. So did merging the two mean the transformation of the secret service? Dr Philip Davies, author of ""MI6 and the Machinery of Spying"", knew about the merger - though he had not seen the detailed manpower figures - and considers it more of a takeover. He says that it was the acquisition of the training and research staff which was probably most significant, as SIS had few facilities in this area. When it came to operations, Sir Stewart Menzies made sure that any decisions were left to SIS staff, and the Foreign Office had to approve foreign actions, so the intake of SOE staff didn't mean that James Bond came to SIS. Nonetheless, some of the SOE staff brought in did run clandestine operations within the expanded service. David Smiley, one of the SOE officers who operated behind enemy lines I met probably the only surviving senior officer who did so - Colonel David Smiley, now 92. The first time he went into Albania was with SOE in 1943. His task was to organise partisans to fight the Nazis. It was a difficult assignment. The conditions were harsh - and the Albanians reluctant to fight. In Albania he had poor experience of the ""other"" service. An SIS agent had ""hijacked"" one of his supply drops. ""There was no love lost between SOE and SIS"" he told me. At the end of the war, David Smiley was invited to join SIS. As far as he knew, he was one of only three ex-SOE agents to do so. In the late 1940s he was given another Albanian assignment - his first for SIS. This time, David Smiley was to train pro-British Albanians and then infiltrate them into the newly Communist state from a base in Malta. The operation ran from 1949 -1950. His task ended once the Albanians had gone in. David Smiley was very concerned to discover later that his agents had been quickly captured. He told me that for years he wondered how it had come about: had one of ""his"" Albanians been taken and ""spilled the beans""? He later learned that the operation had been betrayed by Kim Philby. According to Dr Philip Davies, SIS ran similar operations in Ukraine, and the Baltic States. Pro-British Albanians were trained by the SIS after WWII The aim was to send in ""stay behinds"" - nationals of the country, working for the West, who would only become active in case of war. But here too, the networks were betrayed and the agents captured by the communists. Other files uncovered at the National Archives show that it was the Russian nuclear bomb which put a stop to these adventures. Once the Russians had tested their device, and there was evidence that they could deploy nuclear weapons, a secret Cabinet committee decided it was too risky to continue with such clandestine operations. Any escalation would be far too dangerous. This part of history seems to be emerging in fragments - a veteran's recollections here, the odd file coming out at the National Archives. MI5 - the domestic security service - is making its archive public. So far, the files run to the early 1950s. By contrast, SIS, or MI6, has no plans to release any part of its own archive. The documents I found were in a folder from the Air Ministry."
37,"A Malaysian state has announced that it will ban a type of heavy-metal music which Islamic authorities say has a bad influence on young people.  The government and Muslim clerics fear ""black metal"" has encouraged some young people to dabble in the occult.  The government last week ordered state-run radio and television to play less heavy metal music, and began requiring foreign groups to submit videotapes for approval before playing concerts in Malaysia. Reports say some schools have started strip-searching students to look for tattoos linked to the music - a move denounced by the country's Bar Council. An annual meeting of government-appointed clerics in the predominantly Muslim country called for a blanket ban on black metal music and associated images at the beginning of the month. On Friday, the south-western state of Negri Sembilan announced it would issue a fatwa, or Islamic edict, banning the music. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has called a special cabinet meeting on 8 August to discuss the alleged involvement of youth in anti-social activities.  Islamic authorities say they have found evidence that some young people are involved in a ""Satanic"" cult, including necklaces of skulls and references to animal sacrifice in fan magazines. The school searches were intended to uncover evidence of participation in such activities. But some parents are reported to have been angry that their children were subjected to body searches, and Bar Council Chairman Mah Weng Kwai told the New Straits Times newspaper the searches were ""a gross violation of the individual's privacy"". ""The Bar Council is mindful that school authorities have to maintain good conduct and discipline among students,"" he said, but added that even police were not entitled to conduct random searches without suspicion that a law had been broken."

""All grounds with a track have a poor atmosphere, attendances are down and clubs say moving there was a mistake.""  But according to Comolli the club are still deciding whether to move to a new ground or redevelop White Hart Lane.  ""We are looking at all possible options, including extending White Hart Lane, but we may go somewhere else.

39,"The ornate iron gates of a children's home which inspired John Lennon's psychedelic Beatles anthem Strawberry Fields Forever have been removed.  The Salvation Army, which owns the former home, is putting the red Victorian gates into storage.  It means Beatles fans who pass the Woolton site on bus tours will now be met with 10ft (3m) high replicas.  The charity said fans would still get an ""authentic experience"", but one tour guide said they were ""aghast"".  Replicas of the 100-year-old wrought iron gates have been made by metal work specialist Jim Bennett, from Aigburth, and given to The Salvation Army.  The originals are being taken to a secret location for storage, but could eventually be auctioned off.  The long-term future of the site, which closed in 2005, is yet to be determined but the charity hopes to develop a centre for children with learning disabilities.  ""Although care has been taken to ensure the original gates to the site have remained in good condition, inevitably time has taken its toll,"" said Maj Ray Irving, director of social services for The Salvation Army.  ""This means that the original gates can be kept safe from further deterioration and with the replica gates in place, allow for an authentic experience for the many thousands of people who come on a 'musical pilgrimage' to Strawberry Field.""  Lennon wrote Strawberry Fields Forever, which was released in 1967, from his memories of playing in the area as a child.  The site remains a popular stop on tours of the city's Beatles landmarks and Paul Beesley, chair of the Association of Liverpool Tour Guides, said he was worried about the effect of the gates' removal.  He said: ""Last night I was bringing a group here and I decided to tell them they would have been the very final group who would see the gates and they were absolutely aghast.""  Mr Beesley said he would like to see the gates placed in a museum, but that uncertainty over their future was not helpful.  ""We don't know what's going to happen to them - that's really worrying and I know the fans are not going to be happy.""  The original Strawberry Field, which housed a large number of children who had been taken into care, was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced with a smaller building.  It closed in May 2005 and has since been used by community groups and various Salvation Army projects."
40,"Are military metaphors such as ""battling"" always appropriate when it comes to cancer, asks Andrew Graystone.  In the summer of 1971 the US government was under pressure. After 10 costly years of deployment in Vietnam the public appetite for war was evaporating and President Richard Nixon was beginning to withdraw troops.  It was against this background that on 23 December 1971, Nixon signed into law the National Cancer Act. He committed $1.5bn to what became known as ""the war on cancer"". Having failed to subdue the Viet Cong, Nixon hoped that taking on an enemy that directly affected millions of Americans would deliver him the most significant victory of his presidency.  Nixon didn't defeat cancer of course, but he did transform the rhetoric we use to talk about it. Up to that point cancer had been a shameful secret in many families. Often cancer patients weren't even told what they were suffering from. Film actor John Wayne coined the phrase ""the Big C"" to avoid naming the disease. But through the 1970s cancer gained a new vocabulary.  For 40 years the language of warfare has dominated cancer discourse.  We have given cancer a personality and made an enemy of it, so that today it's commonplace to speak about battling cancer, fighting cancer, even kicking cancer. Oncologists are painted as heroic warriors, the SAS of the medical world - sometimes fighting hand to hand with scalpels, sometimes using lasers, ray guns and chemical weapons.  In reality, cancer is a collection of many different diseases, but we have turned them into a single adversary. It's probably no coincidence that this has happened at a time when the US and the UK have been engaged in the equally abstract and seemingly unwinnable War on Terror.  The language of warfare can work well for cancer research organisations. In the competitive market-place of charities they need to create simple campaign messages to evoke a response. Natasha Hill, from Cancer Research UK, says that donors respond well to messages that personify cancer and treat it as an enemy. So the advertising agency that designed Cancer Research UK's recent Race for Life campaign wanted to turn their traditional sponsored runners into ""an army who run, dance and sing all up in cancer's stupid stupid face with the new line of Cancer We're Coming To Get You"".  There are effectively two cancers. The objectified cancer of the campaigns and research programmes exists only in the abstract, and it has been so stubbornly unbeatable that it's taken on a mythical status. It offends our evolutionary optimism - the sense that whatever is bad in the world will eventually be defeated by human skill and ingenuity. Perhaps it's not going too far to say that the war on cancer is actually a battle against death itself.  But the individual, personal cancer that around a third of us will experience is different. Some people who have cancer find the language of battle useful - but not all of us. Some of us need new metaphors that come closer to our own experience. When I was diagnosed with cancer four years ago, the language of warfare jarred with me. It was partly because I'm not really the fighting kind, and partly because, frankly, there wasn't much that I could do to fight my cancer.  Like most cancers, mine was out of reach. I couldn't see it or touch it. I couldn't operate on myself or prescribe medication. My chief aim was to live well with cancer, and then hopefully to live well without it. And yet I felt a strange expectation that I should declare civil war in my body. These were my cancer cells - part of me that I had unwittingly created. I found it hard to like them, but I didn't feel it would help to turn my body into a war zone. I don't like all the parts of my body equally, but as a rule I try not to hate any of them.  Prof Michael Overduin, of Birmingham University, researches cancer at a molecular level. He knows that talk of designing ""warheads"" to target cancer cells with minimum ""collateral damage"" has an immediate appeal to funding agencies. But he sees his work as more of a puzzle to be solved than a battle to be won. ""Cells work together like the players in an orchestra playing a symphony,"" he says. ""But if a cell is malfunctioning it produces dissonance. The instrument may need to be retuned or the cell retrained.""  Poet and priest Jim Cotter describes his cancerous bone marrow as like a garden that has become overgrown with weeds. The weedkiller that takes out the weeds also damages the healthy plants. But with luck the good plants may re-grow.  St Francis of Assisi - who had long-term illness himself - is said to have spoken about Sister Illness. He embraced his illness like a family member. For me, cancer arrived as an unwelcome lodger, parking itself in the back room and demanding attention. For three years I tried to be a courteous if unwilling host.  Eventually the time came to invite my cancer to leave. She has left the place in a bit of a mess, and I'm conscious that she has kept the key. Still I'm hopeful that in due course all I will be left with is the rich memory of time spent with a stranger I never expected to meet.  Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook"
41,"Roald Dahl's widow Felicity said the plaque was ""fantastic""    A blue plaque has been unveiled at the site of a favourite sweet shop of the young Roald Dahl, later immortalised in the author's memoirs. The old shop, now a Chinese takeaway, is in the Cardiff suburb of Llandaff, where the author was born and spent his early years in the 1920s. Dahl's widow Felicity said she was delighted his son Theo, who had flown from the US, had unveiled the plaque. ""It's fantastic. It's an enormous accolade to Roald,"" she said. The event is part of the fourth annual Roald Dahl Day celebrations. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The shop was located at 11 High Street, Llandaff, a short distance from Llandaff Cathedral, whose school Dahl attended from 1923 to 1925. The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory author later wrote an account in his autobiography Boy of ""The Great Mouse Plot"", describing how he and four accomplices got their revenge on the reputedly terrifying sweetshop owner, named Mrs Pratchett in his book, by slipping a dead mouse into a jar of gobstoppers. Danny, the Champion of the World ((1975) The plaque is the first in public view to recognise Dahl's life in Llandaff, and needed a visit from Mrs Dahl to assist in pinpointing the exact location of the shop. Children from local schools had been invited to the ceremony on Monday afternoon, which was followed by a re-enactment of ""The Great Mouse Plot"". Mrs Dahl said: ""What's so lovely is that he was born here, he went to school here and certainly sweets were a major part of his life and [were part of] possibly the most famous book of all, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. ""Theo, his son, was able to pull the curtain on the plaque and that, for me, was fantastic."" She added: ""I think he [Dahl] would have been amazed. He would have a smile on his face, he really would."" It is believed the owner of the sweetshop was a woman named Catherine Morgan, who would have been in her 70s at the time Dahl was a local schoolboy. The owner of the Chinese takeaway, Han Lau, said she had been aware of the connection with Dahl. ""I'm very proud the plaque is on and this shop is connected to Roald Dahl. It's an honour to be associated with such a great man,"" she said. ""I've got two boys - one is 20 and he read all the books and the other is seven and he's just finished his first Roald Dahl book."" Geoff Barton-Greenwood from the Llandaff Society said: ""We think [the blue plaque] is very significant because it is the first public recognition of Dahl's birth in Llandaff."" The former sweetshop has been a Chinese takeaway for many years Dahl's family lived at two houses in the area, one of which does have a commemorative plaque, but it is not visible from public areas, he explained. The society is looking to work with other organisations to create a Roald Dahl trail in Cardiff, starting at the Norwegian church in Cardiff Bay where Dahl's parents and their family worshipped and ending in Radyr in the north of the city, where the family lived at an art-nouveau mansion prior to his father's premature death. Dahl had five children with his first wife, the American actress Patricia Neal. They divorced in 1983 and he married Felicity d'Abreu Crosland.     "

He has managed to record what he believes are the elusive, instantaneous sounds made by shooting stars as they crash through the Earth's upper atmosphere. The display of shooting stars was amazing, says Dejan Vinkovic The extraordinary thing about these noises is that the observer on the ground hears them at the same time as the meteor appears overhead. On the face of it, this would seem impossible because it would require the noises to break the sound barrier! These strange sounds are very rare He made the recordings during last November's Leonid meteor storm and presented his findings to a conference in San Francisco this week. Dejan Vinkovic, currently at the University of Kentucky, conducted his enterprising experiment on an expedition to Mongolia. He was joined by colleagues Slaven Garaj, Goran Zgrablic and a number of others from the University of Zagreb. They were perfectly placed to record any sounds that might accompany the Leonids, the shower of shooting stars that are seen when the Earth plunges through the dust debris left by Comet Temple Tuttle as it circles the Sun. Since Biblical times, stories have been told of a low thunder-like noise instantly accompanying bright shooting stars. But it was not until 1784 that proper research into the phenomena began. Sir Charles Blagdon, the then Secretary of the Royal Society, collected eyewitness accounts of a bright fireball that rushed across the UK. He noted surprisingly that all the witnesses had heard the accompanying rumble at the same time, regardless of where they were in the country. The team endured freezing temperatures while they waited for the Leonids Blagdon concluded that it could not be a proper acoustic sound as it had travelled too fast. But he knew of no principle that could account for what his witnesses had heard and declared that future observations would no doubt explain it. But it was to take almost two centuries to explain the principle when a huge fireball streaked across Australia promoting lots of reports of the ""instant"" sound phenomenon again. This time astronomer Colin Keay gathered the eyewitness accounts and proposed that the twisting wake of the fireball might trap its magnetic field - creating very long radio waves which would travel to the ground below at the speed of light. The display of shooting stars was amazing, says Dejan Vinkovic In the lab Keay showed that such radio frequencies could produce an audible sound at ground level by interacting with anything from a tree to someone's hairstyle or pair of spectacles! He called his phenomena electrophonic sound. Generating sounds in this way is still somewhat controversial. And most astronomers believed that these instant sounds which accompanied bright meteors were just something that eyewitnesses were imagining. The proof to the contrary has had to wait until now. Away from civilisation, 20 kilometres south of Ulan Bator and battling with temperatures below minus 30 degrees centigrade, Dejan Vinkovic and his team set out to record these enigmatic X-sounds. The Microphones were buried in sealed wooden boxes ""Our equipment was not sophisticated,"" he admits. ""To protect the microphones from wind noise, we just buried them in sealed wooden boxes with a partition of aluminium or paper foil to act as a kind of drum skin. Then we just covered them in snow and waited."" Their wait was rewarded after two frigid nights when the fireballs started falling over the Mongolian steps. ""We were just chatting around midnight and suddenly a few happened,"" recalls Vinkovic. ""Then they just came, brighter and brighter. We stood there amazed. It was complete madness. I've never seen fireballs so bright. You could see your shadow - night turned to day."" Vikovic estimates they saw more than 30 fireballs in about five hours. But this was a freak night that probably will not be repeated in our lifetimes. ""And the accompanying sounds are very rare,"" he stresses. Remember, it is the thud in the middle of the clicks that is the electrophonic sound ""The average person may expect to hear only one electrophonic fireball in a lifetime, as long as they spend most of their night hours outside."" Alternatively you could click on our RealAudio recording. The sound to listen out for is a thud heard in between a couple of sharp clicks.         "
