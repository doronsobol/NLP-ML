But as this proposal would involve a move out of the immediate Tottenham area and because ongoing users were reportedly required to retain the stadium's running track, Spurs dropped the plan in October 2006.

Chairman Daniel Levy hinted last year he may bid to take Spurs to the new 80,000 stadium once the Games are over.  But sporting director Damien Comolli revealed: "There is no way we are looking to move there.  "All grounds with a track have a poor atmosphere, attendances are down and clubs say moving there was a mistake."  But according to Comolli the club are still deciding whether to move to a new ground or redevelop White Hart Lane.  "We are looking at all possible options, including extending White Hart Lane, but we may go somewhere else.  "Whatever happens, it won't affect the financial stability of the club or the ability to invest in players.  "The board are determined that doesn't happen and we will be very careful about it."
