The UK title will be decided by a "best of three" competition Hundreds of games' fans are expected to descend on a Devon pub next month to fight for the right to be crowned the UK's "rock, paper, scissors" champion. The popular game, thought to originate in Japan, has been played for years to settle countless disputes - including whose turn it is to wash the dishes. It relies on quick-fire hand gestures, where rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The championship will be held at the Imperial pub in Exeter on 9 June. The competition has been organised by Tiverton-based Wacky Nation, which specialises in unusual or "off-the-wall" events. The game is thought to have originated in Japan Also used as a means of selection instead of coin tossing Organiser Sally Raynes, who claims her first taste of "wackiness" ended in complete humiliation when she sank twice in the Mountain Bike Bog Snorkel, said the main aim is to have fun. "Everyone is down in the doldrums because of the recession and this is something that almost everybody enjoys and knows how to play," she told BBC News. "Mums play it with their children to decide bedtimes and students play it to decide who buys the next round of drinks." The UK championship title will be decided with a "best of three" knockout tournament. There will be a separate competition for children, plus a charity "winner stays on" event to raise money for CLIC Sargent. "People say there are certain strategies that can help with the game and others say you have to be quick of eye, but the truth is absolutely anyone can do it and anybody could win," Ms Raynes said. In 2006, Briton Bob Cooper competed with 500 contestants to win the world championships which are held every year by the World Rock Paper Scissors Society in Toronto, Canada.
