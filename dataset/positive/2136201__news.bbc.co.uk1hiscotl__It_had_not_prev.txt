Ebenezer Place in Wick measures 6ft 9in and has one address, the front door of No 1 Bistro - part of Mackays Hotel.  A Guinness World Records spokeswoman confirmed that Craig Glenday, the editor-in-chief of the Guinness Book of Records, visited Wick.  She added that Ebenezer Place had beaten the current world record of 17ft Elgin Street in Bacup, Lancashire.  Mackays Hotel owner Murray Lamont said he had always been confident Ebenezer Place would set a world record.  He said: "Everyone is delighted.  "The street was built in 1883 and people here know about it but I decided to put it firmly on the map. It has certainly become a great point of interest."  Mr Lamont said he did not know where the street's name had come from.  "It could have religious or Masonic roots," he added.
