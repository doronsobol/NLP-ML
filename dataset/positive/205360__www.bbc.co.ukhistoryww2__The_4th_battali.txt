AUTHOR: Ron Hancock   Typed by Teresa Marsh, and is being entered into the Peoples War website with your permission  I joined the Coldstream Guards in February 1940, formed the fourth battalion about October 1940. Stationed in Elstree, London. We trained as infantry and then after about 12 months we went over to the motorised battalion. More training, then the Guards Armoured Division was formed. We had Churchill tanks, sixth Brigade. I was attached to the Welsh Guards for six months as a driving instructor, then got made up to Sargent, eventually finished up as Tank Commandor.  The first time we went into action was Falaise just outside Cannes. After crossing the Rhine we had a German Panther tank which our infantry captured, and although I was a Sargent I was detailed the driver, which we used for some time against the Germans. Then I reverted back to reconaisance. We went on route to Munster. April 6th, 45, I got wounded by a sniper and lost an eye. That was the end of the war for me!  Ron would like to say hello to all his colleagues who served in the fourth battalion.  Â© Copyright of content contributed to this Archive rests with the author. Find out how you can use this.
