Foxes boss Ian Holloway was eager to bring the 18-year-old to the Walkers Stadium and thought he was on the verge of getting his man.  But Holloway told BBC Radio Leicester: "We have now been told we can't have him. Chelsea do not want to let him go to a team that's where we are.  "There's one struck off that we had half-planned and half-promised."  Sinclair is back at Stamford Bridge after a loan spell at QPR but has fallen down the pecking order following Florent Malouda's return to fitness.  Holloway thought he had a good chance of landing the England youth international but has been told they want him to play for a side near the top of the Championship table.  He added: "If they do loan him out they want to loan him to a club with a chance of getting in the play-offs because they want him to experience that."  Holloway was also previously manager of Bristol Rovers, from whom Sinclair joined the Premier League giants in July 2005.
