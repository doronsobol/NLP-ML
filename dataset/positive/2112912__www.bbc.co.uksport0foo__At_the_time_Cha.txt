Championship side Charlton have dismissed head coach Bob Peeters after only 25 league matches in charge.  The 41-year-old former Belgium international striker was appointed on a 12-month contract in May.  Only one league win in the last 12 have left Charlton 14th in the table, 10 points off the play-off places.  The club confirmed that the contracts of development coach Patrick Van Houdt and performance analyst Guy Kiala have also been terminated.  Confirming the news, Charlton's website said: "The club would like to thank the trio for their efforts and a further statement will be made in due course."  The Addicks are the 13th Championship club to change their manager this term.
