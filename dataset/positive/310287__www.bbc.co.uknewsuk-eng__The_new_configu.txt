A new tram stop at Victoria Station in Manchester has reopened after it closed 12 months ago as part of a wider £44m refurbishment at the site.  Trams from Bury and Rochdale are terminating at the stop as new platforms and tracks have been built in the Network Rail project.  Services through the station to reach Shudehill will resume on Saturday, once works along Balloon Street have ended.  Redevelopment of the site includes a new £20m roof.  During the closure, trams have been passing through Victoria in both directions on a single track without stopping for safety reasons.  Victoria-bound passengers have been alighting at Shudehill.  Peter Cushing, Transport for Greater Manchester's Metrolink director, said: "Although there will still be a lot of construction activity in the station, it will restore key services and connections for passengers."  The station roof had leaked since 1996 when a bomb, believed to have been planted by the IRA, exploded in the city centre.
