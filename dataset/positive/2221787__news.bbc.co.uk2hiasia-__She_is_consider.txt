During a 45-minute televised address, Queen Sirikit spoke of the suffering of ordinary Thais caught in the violence.  Earlier, Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra blamed the violence on Thai Muslims who had studied Islam abroad.  He denied suggestions that foreign organisations were behind the attacks, which have left 30 dead in the last three weeks.  Queen Sirikit was addressing politicians and other community leaders at the Royal Palace in Bangkok on Tuesday, but her words were broadcast to the nation.  Thailand's revered royal family rarely becomes engaged in the public business of politics and the decision to broadcast her declaration was a break with tradition.  While the queen has a strong bond with southern Thailand - she spends months in the Muslim majority provinces every year - her role is normally one of quiet diplomacy.  She urged people to help the government solve the problems in the south and to show disapproval at the violence against innocent people.  She recounted the stories of police officers and civil servants who have died in ambushes and attacks by so-called militants.  At least 500 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and militants this year, including at least 85 Muslims at a protest last month in Takbai, in Narathiwat province.  An investigation is underway into what happened at Takbai. The UN has urged that it be swift, independent and thorough.
