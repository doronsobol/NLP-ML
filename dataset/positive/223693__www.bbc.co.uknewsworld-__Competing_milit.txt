Tensions remain high in Libya as the militias from the western city of Misrata are ordered to leave the capital Tripoli.  Dozens have been killed since Friday in some of the country's worst violence since the revolution two years ago.  The militias - some formed to topple ex-leader Col Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 - still operate and have refused to disarm.
