Around 60 firemen were fighting the blaze which broke out shortly before 1100 GMT at the Fina station just north of Bar Hill, near Lolworth.  Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service says two lorries collided as one came off the A14 westbound for the petrol station forecourt.  There was a big explosion and the emergency services were called to the scene.  Some people were reported to be in the immediate vicinity of the crash.  Police closed the westbound carriageway of the A14 and sealed off the area for public safety.  Tailbacks were reported to be stretching as far as the M11.
