The original dock workings which made Liverpool an international port and gave the city its name are now open to the public.  The Old Dock, located underneath the Liverpool One shopping area, was the world's first commercial enclosed wet dock, built in 1715.  This development on the mouth of the Pool saw a small village transform into a major port within 100 years.  The Old Dock opens to the public on Tuesday, 4 May, 2010.  The excavation of the area featured on Channel Four's Time Team programme in 2008.  Objects found in the dig are on display and a giant screen shows an animated view of how the view out from the dock would have looked in 1715.  Visitors can view the east section of the dock which includes a tunnel believed to have linked to Liverpool Castle.  Care was taken when building the Liverpool One complex to preserve the original dock walls.  Chris Bliss, Liverpool One's Estate Director said, "Grosvenor has incorporated the Old Dock into the design of Liverpool One and has developed a visitor facility which will be run by National Museums Liverpool.  "This was where Liverpool started."  Tours are free and will start at the Maritime Museum Liverpool. For more information call 0151 478 4296 visit Maritime Museum Liverpool website.
