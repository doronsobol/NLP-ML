Pop group Simply Red are to reform next year for a 30th anniversary tour, five years on from their last performance.  "I like an anniversary and this is a big one," singer Mick Hucknall said. "It feels like the right time."  The chart-topping group, whose hits include Holding Back the Years and Money's Too Tight to Mention, signed off in December 2010 with a "farewell concert" at the O2 Arena in London.  The band will play 35 European dates in 2015 starting in Denmark on 20 October.  The Big Love tour will take in 10 cities in Germany and eight other countries before going to the UK and Ireland for 14 dates.  The comeback will come to an end with two dates at London's O2, almost five years to the day from their last appearance there.  The line-up will include the long-time Simply Red members saxophonist Ian Kirkham, guitarist Kenji Suzuki and bass player Steve Lewinson.  In a hand-written note on the band's website, Hucknall said: "Hello everyone. Am happy to celebrate with you our 30 years in music.  "We hope you're gonna enjoy the shows as much as we will. See you there!"  Formed in 1985, Simply Red have sold more than 50 million albums. The band's name was inspired by Hucknall's love of Manchester United, his left-leaning political affiliations and the colour of his hair.  Hucknall, now 54, went solo after the split and released a collection of American soul covers in 2012.
