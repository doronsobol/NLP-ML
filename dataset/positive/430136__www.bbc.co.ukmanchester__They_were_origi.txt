Diamond Duggal of Simon & Diamond talks to Pam Sambhi on DubAsia Simon and Diamond have worked with a host of top selling artists, including Maxi Priest, Sly & Robbie and Erasure.      They started their illustrious careers in their home-town of Birmingham, back in 1990, when they took an unknown reggae artist called Apache Indian, to the top of the charts with a track called ‘Boom Shak-a-Lak’!      Since then they have gone from strength to strength producing albums for both Asian and mainstream artists. Shania Twain     The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites. Shania Twain's new album Up! breaks new boundaries for the country singer.      Drawing inspiration from the Asian subcontinent, Shania and her production team have created an entirely separate production of her brand new album, in the form of the ‘Blue Mixes’ - Asian and Eastern influenced versions of the album Up!     The Blue Mixes are produced by leading Asian producers Simon and Diamond. The Duggal brothers were initially invited to play as musicians to add Indian influences to one track for Shania’s forthcoming album, back in May of last year.      But once Shania and her producer-husband Mutt Lange heard what the pair were capable of, they decided to go the whole hog and produce a completely separate version of the album.     Said Diamond: "Working with the orchestra out in India was a great experience for us. They are true masters of their instruments, and we hope that the orchestrations and mixes that we have produced will put Indian music on the map for a whole new audience."      Pam Sambhi, presenter of the Asian youth programme for Manchester DubAsia, talked to Diamond about working with Shania Twain.      Listen to the full interview >>>
