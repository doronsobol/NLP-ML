Mexican Larios outpointed McCullough in February on a unanimous decision although the Irishman disputed the wide margin of the verdict in California.  The 34-year-old Belfast native has lost his last five world title bouts over the last eight years.  However, the former WBC bantamweight champion has resisted calls to retire.  McCullough, known as the Pocket Rocket, held the WBC bantamweight title in the mid-1990s but he failed in world title bouts against Daniel Zaragoza, Naseem Hamed, Erik Morales, Scott Harrison and Larios.  He described news of his latest world title challenge as "a dream come true".  "And to have it in Las Vegas, where I've lived since coming to America in 1992 is the icing on the cake," said McCullough.  Renowned trainer Freddie Roach will prepare the Belfastman for the 16 July bout, which will be on the undercard of the world middleweight championship bout between Bernard Hopkins and Jermain Taylor.
