The Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, will arrive in Cuba on April twenty-seventh to meet President Fidel Castro.  A Cuban Foreign Ministry statement said the visit would highlight the close ties between the two countries.  Mr Chretien will be the first Canadian government leader to visit the island since Pierre Trudeau was in Havana in 1976.  Mr Chretien announced his trip -- but not its date -- at the Summit of the Americas in Chile, a meeting not attended by Cuba.  Canada is Cuba's third largest trading partner, with trade worth seven hundred million dollars last year.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
