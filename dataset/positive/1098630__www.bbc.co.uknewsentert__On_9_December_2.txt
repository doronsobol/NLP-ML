Gabrielle Aplin's cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood ballad The Power of Love has knocked Olly Murs off the top of the UK singles chart.  Aplin's track, which features on the Christmas TV advert for department store John Lewis has climbed up the charts after its release last month.  Murs's Troublemaker was pushed into third spot behind Bruno Mars at number two with Locked Out of Heaven.  But there was consolation for Murs as he remained top of the album chart.  Right Place Right Time claimed the number one spot for the second week in a row.  Rounding out the singles top five were Labrinth featuring Emily Sande - Beneath You're Beautiful - at four, and Rihanna's Diamonds at five.  The highest new entry was Pitbull FT TJR with Don't Stop the Party, giving the US rapper his ninth top 40 hit as a lead artist.  Christmas-themed songs from the past on the chart included The Pogues featuring Kirsty MacColl's A Fairytale Of New York.  It re-entered the Top 40 for the eighth year running, and is at number 15.  Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You is at number 20, with Wizzard's I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday at 31.  Wham's Last Christmas is at 34, with Slade's Merry Xmas Everybody at 35.  The run-up to Christmas was also evident in the album top five, with Michael Buble's Christmas album climbing two places to second spot.  One Direction's Take Me Home dropped one place to third position, and was followed by Rod Stewart's Merry Christmas, Baby, at four and Neil Diamond's The Very Best Of at five.  There were four new entries on the album chart - Jools Holland's The Golden Age of Song at 21, Welsh choir Only Boys Aloud at 32 and the Bee Gees' greatest hits collection, Mythology, at 33.
