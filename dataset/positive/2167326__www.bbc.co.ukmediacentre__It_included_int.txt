The drama is intertwined with contributions from Charlie Burton, now in his 80s, and their cycling champion daughter, Denise Burton Cole. This is Maxine's first foray into writing. She was inspired to tell Berylâ€™s story of this working class mum from Morley in Leeds, who, with no financial backing or training, combined farm work with global domination in all areas of cycling competition.  Initially setting out to tell the story of what it takes to be a champion against all the odds, what Maxine discovered was a love story between Beryl and her bike mechanic and confidant husband, Charlie.  Recorded on bikes in various locations around Saddleworth and in Harrogate, with contributors Charlie Burton and Denise Burton Cole.  With Maxine Peake as Beryl Burton, Mark Jordon as Charlie Burton, Tony Pitts as Stan, Sydney Wade as a young Beryl and Angela, Sophie Downham as a young Denise, Mike McNamara as Nim Carlin.
