Four years on, how busy is the toll road? We decided to find out. At 1pm on Monday 3rd December 2007, we drove along the M6 in two cars fitted with video cameras. Heading away from Birmingham, one used the toll road, the other the M6. Click the link, below, to watch the video.  The country's first pay-as-you-go motorway, the M6 Toll is a 27 mile stretch of three-lane road running between Junction 4 at the NEC and Junction 11A at Wolverhampton of the M6.  The Toll was designed for travellers to bypass some of the most congested areas of the M6 throughout the West Midlands.  However government figures reveal that weekday use of the Toll is down year-on-year, with a drop of 10.6% from September 2006 to the same month in 2007.  An aerial view of the M6 Toll junction Meanwhile, weekday use of the M6 currently doubles its designed capacity. Around 148,900 vehicles used the motorway on a weekday basis in March 2007; the M6 is only designed to carry 72,000 weekday vehicles.  From Monday 3rd - Wednesday 5th December, Phil Upton's Breakfast Show on BBC WM will be conducting an investigation into the success of the M6 Toll. Tune in 7-10am.
