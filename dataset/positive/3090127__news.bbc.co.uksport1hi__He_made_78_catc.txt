He played for the Cubs development team in 2006 but also at wide receiver this season at the University of Notre Dame.  Samardzija made 78 catches for 1,017 yards and 12 touchdowns in 13 games to finish as the all-time Fighting Irish leader in reception yards with 2,593.  But he said: "I will devote my full time and attention to baseball and forgo a potential career in the NFL."  Pitcher Samardzija, who has agreed a five-year Cubs deal, added: "As much as it seemed a possibility last summer, I've concluded that playing two sports professionally is impossible.  "I cannot lie - leaving football will not be easy. But playing baseball is my first love. It is what I want to do for a living."  Playing in both the NFL and MLB is a rare feat.  Bo Jackson was All-Star in both leagues, and Deion Sanders played in both the Super Bowl and World Series.
