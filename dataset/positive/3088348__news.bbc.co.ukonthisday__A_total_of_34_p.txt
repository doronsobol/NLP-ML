A series of bomb attacks on London's transport network has killed more than 30 people and injured about 700 others.  Three explosions on the Underground left 35 dead and two died in a blast on a double decker bus.  The first three bombs went off at 0850 on underground trains just outside Liverpool Street and Edgware Road stations, and on another travelling between King's Cross and Russell Square.  The final explosion was around an hour later on a number 30 double-decker bus in Tavistock Square, not far from King's Cross  Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the bombings had "the hallmarks of an al-Qaeda-related attack".  Prime Minister Tony Blair promised the "most intense police and security service action to make sure we bring those responsible to justice".  Mr Blair, who flew back to London from the G8 summit in Gleneagles, condemned the terrorists and paid tribute to the stoicism and resilience of the people of London.  "They are trying to use the slaughter of innocent people to cow us, to frighten us out of doing the things that we want to do," he said in a televised statement from Downing Street.
