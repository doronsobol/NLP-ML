A swimming pool at a leisure centre bought for £10 by residents in Nottingham is set to re-open, four years to the day after it closed.  Campaign group The Lenton Centre (TLC) bought the former council-run centre in 2004 when it was due to be closed.  The gym was reopened in July and now members of the community will be able to use the swimming pool.  New manager of the centre Carl Towner said it was an important day for the Lenton community.  "This pool has always been well-loved by locals and many people from further afield," said Mr Towner.  "It was originally built as a training pool and so many people learnt to swim here including Adam Faulkner who was in the Olympics twice."  The pool will be officially opened by Adam Faulkner on Friday afternoon followed by a free splash session for residents.  The centre is now run as a business by trustees and used as a community meeting point.
