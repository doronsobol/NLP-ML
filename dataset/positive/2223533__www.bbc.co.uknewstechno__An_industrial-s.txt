An architect in Holland has revealed plans to 3D print buildings inspired by the Earth's landscape.  The buildings are designed to resemble a giant mobius strip - a continuous loop with only one side.  Janjaap Ruijssenaars hopes to create the buildings, which he estimates will cost 4-5 million euros (£3.3- £4.2m), all around the world.  Museums, visitor centres and private individuals had already expressed interest, he said.  Mr Ruijssenaars is working with large-scale 3D printing expert Enrico Dini on the project.  According to his company's website, Mr Dini's industrial sized 3D printer uses sand and a special binding agent to create a "marble like material" stronger than cement.  But the 1,000-sq-m buildings would still require concrete reinforcements, Mr Ruijssenaars said.  "3D printing is amazing," he told the BBC.  "For me as an architect it's been a nice way to construct this specific design - it has no beginning and no end and with the 3D printer we can make it look like that.  "In traditional construction you have to make a mould of wood and you fill it with concrete and then you take out the wood - it's a waste of time and energy.  "You can print what you want - it's a more direct way of constructing."  The first "landscape house" should be in position by 2014, said Mr Ruijssenaars.  "We would like to construct one per country," he said.  "A private individual who lives by a national park in Brazil would like one to display the native American art they have found in the park.  "For a museum, the price is around the right mark."
