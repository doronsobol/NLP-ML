A man who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, in which 47 people died, has been awarded Â£57,000 damages.  A High Court judge said Graham Pearson's life had become a "recurring nightmare" since the tragedy.  Mr Pearson was driving on the M1 near Kegworth in Leicestershire and was the first person to reach the British Midland jet which crashed while trying to land.  The judge found that since the crash, stress had seriously affected Mr Pearson's personal and professional life.  He had suffered feelings of guilt, loss of interest in life and lack of concentration, he lost his job as a kitchen salesman and suffered problems in his marriage. He also had to spend periods in hospital for treatment.  Mr Pearson said: "I feel very relieved. The legal process has taken nine years and every solicitor's letter, every contact with the defendants reminded me of the plane crash."  "It would have been nice to have had some recognition, a letter or something like that, from British Midland for my efforts on that night."  Mr Pearson, who is now re-training for a career in youth and community work, was in the Royal Marines for nine years. He spent two tours of duty in Northern Ireland.  On the night of the crash, he was inside the wreckage of the jet for more than three hours. He helped the emergency services remove casualties and looked after an injured mother and child.  Dr Graham Turnbull, a psychiatrist who worked with the victims affected by the Hungerford shootings and the Lockerbie and Hillsborough disasters, examined Mr Pearson.  He said that the former marine was a strong character who had tried to deny to himself the profound effects the experience had had on him.
