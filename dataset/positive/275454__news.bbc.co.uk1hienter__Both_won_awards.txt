He is currently the managing director of the Barbican in London, which he described as "a unique and wonderful arts centre" upon his appointment in February.  Sir Nicholas, born on 23 February 1951, worked for the English Bach Festival and the BBC's music department before establishing himself as a journalist at the end of the 1970s.  He was a music critic for US magazine The New Yorker and British newspapers The Times and The Observer.  And he worked as an adviser to London's South Bank Centre, earning a Royal Philaharmonic Society award for its Mozart Now festival in 1991.  He took charge of Radio 3 in 1992, a high-profile year for classical music radio in the UK owing to the launch of national commercial station Classic FM.  While Classic FM took a "greatest hits" approach to the genre, gaining a bigger audience than its more established rival, Radio 3 continued to offer a high-brow mixture of recorded and session material, concerts and culture.  His responsibilities widened when he became director of the BBC Proms, a job he held until his appointment to the Barbican this year.  He relinquished his role at Radio 3 in 1998 to play an integral part in the BBC's Millennium programming.  And by 2000, Sir Nicholas was the controller not just of the Proms, but also of live events and classical music on TV.  At the Barbican he replaced Sir John Tusa, who retired after 12 years overseeing a venue which has branded itself "the largest multi-arts centre in Europe".  Sir Nicholas, who is married with four children, was appointed a CBE in 2001 for his services to music and Millennium broadcasting.
