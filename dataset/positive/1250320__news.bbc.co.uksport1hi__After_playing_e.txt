Hartlepool United have released defender Stephen Wright following the expiry of his short-term deal at Victoria Park.  The 31-year-old, brought to the club by former head coach Mick Wadsworth, has been limited to 11 appearances for Pools by an Achilles injury.  Wright's last first-team appearance came in November's 1-0 home defeat by Preston North End.  He will continue to train with Pools in his search for a new club.  Merseyside-born Wright began his career with home-town club Liverpool, before going onto join Crewe, Sunderland, Stoke City, Coventry, and Brentford.
