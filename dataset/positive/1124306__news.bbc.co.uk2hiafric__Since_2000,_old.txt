It is hoped the exchange will take weapons used by civilians during the bloody civil war out of circulation.  Those who swap their guns for a red and white bike will receive training on how to maintain it, said the Royal Mail.  The offer is also open to the child soldiers and young people who fought alongside adults during the conflict, which lasted from 1989 until 2003.  The bikes will be shipped by charity group Re-Cycle, which has sent thousands of reconditioned cycles to various countries.  Some of the bikes have already arrived in Liberia and are being used by people to carry food and other produce around.  "By offering this equipment, we can make a real difference to many people and communities."  Since Royal Mail joined Re-Cycle, the postal organisation has donated more than 8,000 bikes overseas.  In South Africa, children are already using Royal Mail bikes to travel to school and other people are using them to find jobs and travel to work.  Royal Mail has 36,500 bikes and the average lifespan of each model is seven years.
