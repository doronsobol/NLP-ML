President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal of the breakaway region of Somaliland, has commented for the first time on the results of last week's independence referendum in which voters backed cessation from Somalia.  President Egal said Somaliland was no longer just a collection of clans but a nation in its own right.  He said the results of the referendum also brought to an end the question of whether Somaliland should ever reunite with Somalia.  The president said his message to the international community was that Somaliland is worth doing business with. Somaliland broke away from Somalia at the start of the civil war 10 years ago, but is still unrecognized by the the international community.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
