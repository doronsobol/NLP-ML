Anna Carey, 31, was first diagnosed with the disease in 1994, but was given the all-clear after an operation to remove a tumour from her chest and a gruelling nine-month course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.  But the illness returned last year and the former nurse died on Tuesday evening, six days before her 32nd birthday.  But in a statement issued via ITV, they said that they and Anna's two brothers, John, 33, and Robert, 30, extended their heartfelt appreciation to doctors and staff who had treated her at the Royal Brompton, Harefield and Middlesex hospitals.  The statement said that their "incredible care and devotion gave Anna five extra years with her family".  Mrs Carey, who lived with her husband in Knebworth, Herts, died at nearby Stevenage Hospital, where she had worked as a senior ward sister.
