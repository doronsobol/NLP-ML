The Premiership outfit have agreed an undisclosed fee with the League One side for the 20-year-old Democratic Republic of Congo international.  He will become Chris Coleman's second summer signing following the arrival of Jimmy Bullard from Wigan.  Coleman told Fulham's website: "I'm delighted, we beat off considerable competition for Gabriel's signature."  Zakuani made nearly 100 appearances for the O's, scoring three goals, and Coleman admitted he has been tracking the player for some time.  He added: "'I am very happy that Gabriel has joined us this season. He is a really bright prospect for the future and one I have been keeping my eye on over the last couple of seasons.  "I'm delighted that he has chosen to commit his future to Fulham for the long term.  "He has great maturity for his age and I believe that over time he will establish himself as a formidable force at the back."  The fee is reportedly set to exceed the club record Â£600,000 that Orient were paid for John Chiedozie in 1981.
