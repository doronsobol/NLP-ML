Club chairman Chris Taylor subsequently said the club had no plans to sell the trophy.

The world's oldest-known football trophy is not for sale, despite being valued at £100,000, its owners have insisted.  The silver Youdan Cup was presented to non-league Hallam FC in February 1867 after they won a tournament contested by Sheffield teams.  A BBC Antiques Roadshow expert put the estimate on the engraved claret jug.  Hallam's chairman Chris Taylor said the club would be reviewing its insurance policy following the price estimate.  He said: "The cup is actually priceless to us and is definitely not for sale.  "It represents not only our heritage, but that of the national game and that of Sheffield as the true home of football."  However, he added: "If someone is interested in investing time and money in a grassroots club with a rich history then they know who to call."  The Youdan Cup, which predates the FA Cup by four years, was contested by 12 teams, with the final at Sheffield's Bramall Lane.  It was named after theatre owner and football fan Thomas Youdan, who offered the cup and prize money.  Other teams taking part were Broomhall, Fir Vale, Garrick, Heeley, Mackenzie, Mechanics, Milton, Norfolk, Norton, Pitsmoor and Wellington. Only Hallam FC still exists.  They beat Norfolk 2-1 in the final.  The jug featured on Sunday's Antiques Roadshow, from the Roundhouse, Derby.  It first appeared on the programme in 2008, when it was valued at £20,000.  Silver specialist Alastair Dickenson said: "At first sight it's a fairly standard Victorian claret jug, which would be worth about £800."  But he said he had learnt more about the cup's history, adding: "We are pretty certain this is the world's oldest football trophy.  "As such, I think the value has shifted a bit from my previous valuation. I would expect it to fetch £100,000 - probably more."
