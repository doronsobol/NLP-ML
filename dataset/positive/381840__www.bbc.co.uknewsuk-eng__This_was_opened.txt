This was opened to relieve pressure off Kettering General Hospital, and has also replaced the dated Rushden Memorial Clinic which provided at the time about 8,000 appointments a year, when open.

A new Â£4.2m outpatients clinic in Northamptonshire is to open later.  Kettering General Hospital's (KGH) Nene Park Outpatients Clinic is based in Attley Way, Irthlingborough, and replaces the Rushden Memorial Clinic.  The new clinic is expected to care for 40,000 patients each year, compared to the 8,000 dealt with by the Rushden Memorial Clinic.  It is hoped the new clinic will also ease the strain on the Kettering hospital.  KGH's director of strategy and partnerships, Mike Smeeton, said: "This is a much bigger and better facility for both patients and staff with lots of free car parking and there will be a half-hourly bus service linking it to Rushden and Higham Ferrers.  "It will also mean some 32,000 less visits to KGH which should help with car parking on the main site and mean many people living in East Northamptonshire will now have their outpatient appointments in a centre which is much closer to their home than Kettering."  The new clinic includes an X-ray department, ultrasound, audiology hearing room, cardiology service, ophthalmology room, and a minor procedures room.
