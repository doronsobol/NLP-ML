The extension did not prove viable and the previous length of operation has been restored since the 2011/2012 season.

States-owned airline Aurigny has reduced its seasonal service from Guernsey to the city of Grenoble, at the foot of the French Alps.  The direct weekend link, which last year ran for four months, will run for just two months, starting from Christmas Eve this year.  Malcolm Coupar, the airline's commercial director, said: "The figures had been very good until last year."  He said operating from 29 January to 23 April 2011 had been "a step too far".  Mr Coupar said: "The snow conditions in late March and April weren't very good so we've reduced the length of the season and brought it forward."  It will run from 24 December 2011 until 18 February 2012.
