A man arrested shortly after a coach ended up on its side on an embankment of the M40 in Buckinghamshire has been released on bail.  The Oxford Tube double-decker coach to London crashed in the early hours of Monday on the southbound carriageway between junctions two and three.  It is understood one of the 12 passengers on board tried to grab the wheel. No-one was seriously injured.  A 21-year-old man from Oxford has been released on bail until 25 September.  Stagecoach, which runs the Oxford Tube, said nobody was seriously hurt but the 48-year driver suffered a shoulder injury.  The company praised the driver for his actions which it said had minimised what could have been a more serious crash.  Two lanes of the M40 were closed for a time following the crash.
