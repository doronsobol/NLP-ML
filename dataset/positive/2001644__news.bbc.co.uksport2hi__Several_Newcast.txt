Dyer and Bowyer exchanged blows in the middle of the Newcastle half three minutes after Villa had gone 3-0 up.  The pair later appeared alongside manager Graeme Souness to apologise for their conduct, but pointedly did not say sorry to each other.  Both will miss the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United on 17 April.  During their fracas, the duo were separated by Villa goalscorer Gareth Barry and several of their team-mates, though not before Bowyer's shirt had been ripped.  Barry, who scored two penalties to seal Villa's victory, admitted he was stunned to see Bowyer and Dyer brawling on the pitch.  "You don't want to see that happen on the pitch, it's only right to try and break it up," said Barry.  "I've never seen it in a game I've been involved in, there was obviously a lot of frustration boiling over.  "If you look at the two players involved they just want to do everything to win the game. Both players lost their head and it's unfortunate but I'm sure they regret it."
