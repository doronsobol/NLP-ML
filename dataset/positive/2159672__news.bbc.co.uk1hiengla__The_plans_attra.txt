Campaigners against plans to install 400,000 volt power lines through a North Somerset valley have held a public meeting.  The Save Our Valley group is fighting proposals for 160ft (48 metre) high electricity pylons through the valley near Nailsea, Backwell and Wraxall.  The National Grid wants to install the pylons to link a new power station at Hinkley Point with Avonmouth.  Protesters say the new power lines would ruin the countryside.  Two options have been proposed. The first would see some of the existing power lines to the west of Nailsea in the Causeway area replaced.  In the second option, new lines would be built running south of Nailsea across Youngwood Lane, Backwell Lake, Backwell Common, before turning north across Wraxall.  A spokesman for the group said: "If Corridor 2 is built, Nailsea would be surrounded on three sides by 160 feet high, 400,000 volt overhead power lines.  "Backwell will be exposed to these cables for the first time and Wraxall will have them directly overhead.  "Wraxall Primary School and church will both be overshadowed by pylons and power cables and the tranquillity and purity of Backwell Lake will be gone forever."
