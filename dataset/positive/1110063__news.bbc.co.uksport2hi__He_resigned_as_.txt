Former England and Manchester United captain Bryan Robson has resigned as Thailand manager.  The 54-year-old underwent surgery for throat cancer in March.  Worawi Makudi, head of the Thailand Football Association said: "Bryan wished to resign and his contract was terminated by mutual consent. I cannot give any more details."  Under Robson's guidance the team dropped 15 places to 120th in the Fifa rankings.  Robson signed a four-year deal with Thailand in September 2009, replacing compatriot Peter Reid as manager.  But his 21 months at the helm were largely unspectactular, with the team failing to qualify for the 2011 Asian Cup.  Prior to his spell with Thailand, Robson had managed solely in England, with Middlesbrough, Bradford City, West Brom and Sheffield United.
