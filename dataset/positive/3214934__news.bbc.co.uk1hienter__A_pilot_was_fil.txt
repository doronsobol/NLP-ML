The show, which focuses on a pair of socially inept IT technicians, drew audiences of just 1.8m when it was shown in the UK last year.  But Channel 4 has ordered a second series of the sitcom, which is penned by Father Ted creator Graham Linehan.  British comedian Richard Ayoade is expected to reprise his role as Moss in the US version.  The IT Crowd scored a nomination for best comedy at last year's International Emmys, but was eventually beaten by Little Britain.  NBC is also responsible for the hit US adaptation of The Office.
