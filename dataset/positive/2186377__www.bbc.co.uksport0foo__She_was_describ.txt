The 28-year-old winger has agreed a two-year deal with the Blues, who won the Women's Super League title and the FA Women's Cup double last season.  "The team established themselves as the top club in the country and I'm excited about the prospect of helping to build on that," she told Chelsea's website.  'It is the right point in my career to begin a new challenge."  Carney has won 110 international caps and was a member of the England side which finished third at the World Cup earlier this year.  She has previously played under Chelsea manager Emma Hayes at Arsenal Ladies and Chicago Red Stars.  "Karen was a major target and a genuine world-class addition to the squad," Hayes said.  "She is a student of the game and brings additional leadership to our squad.  "I see Karen complimenting the talent we already possess in the final third. All our attacking players will benefit hugely from her vision and passing."
