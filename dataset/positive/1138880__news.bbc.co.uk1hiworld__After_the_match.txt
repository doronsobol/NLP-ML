Police on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius say seven people were burned to death when rioters threw petrol bombs into a casino, in violence following an important football match on Sunday.  Two of the dead were children.  The riots, in the capital, Port Louis, followed a match which saw the League champions, Scouts Club, beaten by another club, Fire Brigade.  Hundreds of Scouts fans then went on the rampage, torching sugar cane fields, and attacking police vehicles.  Two people have now been arrested in connection with the casino fire.
