All these factors led the explosives expert to conclude that all three bombs had been manufactured by the same people, and that it was likely that whoever had constructed these bombs had also committed previous IRA attacks.

Bombs have devastated two central Birmingham pubs, killing 19 people and injuring over 180.  Police have said they believe the Provisional IRA planted the devices in the Mulberry Bush and the nearby Tavern in the Town.  The explosions coincided with the return to Ireland of the body of James McDade, the IRA man who was killed in Coventry last week when the bomb he was planting blew up prematurely.  The two blasts were only seconds apart and happened at about 2030 GMT, when the bars were packed with mainly teenage drinkers.  Police attempted to clear both pubs, but the bombs went off only 12 minutes after a man with an Irish accent telephoned the Birmingham Post newspaper with a warning.  The first attack was in the Mulberry Bush, which is located on the ground-floor of the 17-storey Rotunda office block.  The second device exploded 50-yards (45.7 m) away in an underground bar, the Tavern in the Town.  Michael Willis, 18, was in the Tavern when the bomb went off.  "I was going to put a record on the juke box when there was an explosion.  "There were bodies everywhere and I had to clamber over them to get out - the screaming and groaning from the injured was terrifying," he said.  Many of the injured were ferried to nearby hospital in taxis and private cars, and dozens of ambulances from all over the West Midlands were called in.  Assistant Chief Constable for West Midlands Police Maurice Buck said the carnage caused by the bombs was "disastrous and appalling".
