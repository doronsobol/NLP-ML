Alex Tew, 21, of Cricklade, Wiltshire, who will go to Nottingham University in October to study business management, launched milliondollarhomepage.com.  Companies choose from the one million pixels on the site and buy their own for one dollar (60p) each.  "I have lots of investment ideas but want to be sensible," he said.  One of Alex's three elder brothers left university owing £30,000, prompting him to a firm decision not to slide into the red.  "I was up late with my notepad when it came to me," said Alex.

If his site succeeds, he should leave university with $1m (£543,615).  "I don't believe it," he told BBC News Interactive. "It doesn't really sink in, doesn't make sense.  "They are sold in blocks of 10 with a minimum investment of $100."
