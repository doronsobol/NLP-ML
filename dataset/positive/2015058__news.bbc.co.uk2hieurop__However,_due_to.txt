However, due to his extraordinary age, he was unable to recover from such a minor illness.

Joan Riudavets Moll, who celebrated his 114th birthday three months ago, died on Friday night after suffering from a cold for several days.  Mr Riudavets died at his home in Es Migjorn Gran - the same village in which he was born on 15 December 1889.  He spent his entire working life as a cobbler and retired half a century ago.  He attributed his longevity to his Mediterranean diet, based on tomatoes, fish and olive oil.  He continued to take walks to the end of his life and always enjoyed socialising.  Mr Riudavets was declared by the Guinness Book of Records to be the oldest living man whose date of birth was fully authenticated last September, after the death of the previous record-holder.  His wife, whom he married in 1917, also lived to a respectable age - she too was born in 1889 and died at the age of 90.
