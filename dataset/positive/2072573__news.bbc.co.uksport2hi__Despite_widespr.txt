More than 600,000 people have backed a campaign to have netball included in the 2012 London Olympics.  Team Bath goalkeeper Eboni Beckford-Chambers, who has played three times for England, began her campaign on a social networking website.  The Olympic bid has been backed by high-profile supporters who include Gordon Brown and Cherie Blair.  Blair told the club website: "Netball is the most popular sport in the world for women."  She added: "Including it in the Olympics would send out a strong message that there are as many chances for women as men to compete at the highest level in team sports."  The International Olympic Committee has approved netball as an Olympic sport but there are no plans to include the game in the 2012 or 2016 Games.  The Olympic committee will meet in Denmark in October 2009 to discuss the issue.
