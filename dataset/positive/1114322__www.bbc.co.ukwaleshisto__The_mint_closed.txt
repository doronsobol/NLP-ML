The construction of Aberystwyth castle was begun in 1277, after Edward I's defeat of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, and completed in 1289.  In 1404, the castle fell to Owain Glyndŵr and it was occupied until being recaptured by cannon in 1408. During this occupation it became an important seat of Welsh government.  In 1637, the castle was chosen by Charles I to house a royal mint. Coins of eight different denominations were produced from local silver. All carried the emblem of the Prince of Wales feathers.  Charles Bushell, who operated the mint in 1637, became very wealthy. At the start of the Civil War he lent Charles I £40,000 and raised a regiment of soldiers made up from local miners. Bushell's mint was closed down during the Civil War, but was used to store silver and lead.  Garrisoned by Royalists, the castle was besieged by the Parliamentarians and surrendered in 1646. Cromwell's troops made a good job of demolishing the building, thus preventing it ever being used again. But perhaps it also reflected the symbolic importance of the castle as a royal mint.
