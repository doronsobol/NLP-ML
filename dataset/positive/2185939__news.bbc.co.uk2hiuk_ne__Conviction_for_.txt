Khalid Khaliq, from Beeston, in Leeds, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of involvement in the 7 July London bombings.  But the charge Mr Khaliq faced when he appeared before City of Westminster Magistrates' Court does not relate to the 2005 attacks.  Mr Khaliq, an unemployed, single father-of-three, is accused of possessing the manual on 17 July 2005.  The possession of such a document - containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism - carries a maximum 10-year jail sentence.  Mr Khaliq spoke to magistrates only to confirm his name and address.  His solicitor, Nadeem Afzal, said his client denied the charge.  Mr Khaliq was one of four people arrested on 9 May in West Yorkshire and Birmingham by anti-terrorism officers investigating the 7/7 bombings.  The other three - Hasina Patel, the widow of 7/7 ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan, her brother Arshad Patel and Imran Motala - were last week released without charge.  Fifty-two people died and more than 750 were injured when suicide bombers attacked three London Underground trains and a bus almost two years ago.
