The Dublin-based C&C Group has bought Tennent's lager in a deal worth Â£180m.  C&C, which makes Magners cider, has acquired the Irish, Northern Irish and Scottish businesses of Anheuser-Busch InBev, including the Tennent's brands.  The cost of the merger between Anheuser-Busch and InBev is thought to have forced the company to sell some of its assets.  Tennent's is Scotland's leading lager, accounting for 55% of pub sales. C&C said the deal made good business sense.  Stephen Glancey, C&C's chief operating officer, said: "We're buying it because it's a fantastic iconic Scottish brand and above everything else it will provide us with a platform for developing Magners in Scotland."  The firm makes the cider brands Bulmers and Magners, as well as a range of niche spirits and liqueurs.  Along with Tennent's lager, it has also acquired the Wellpark Brewery in Glasgow and distribution rights for brands including Becks and Stella Artois.  A spokesman for the company said that he expected that Tennent's sponsorship of the annual rock festival T in the Park would continue.
