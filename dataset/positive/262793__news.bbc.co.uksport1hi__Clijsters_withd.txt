Clijsters, who is seeded second, injured her wrist during Friday's win against Germany's Angelika Roesch.  Tournament doctors described the injury as a bruised bone on her left wrist and tendonitis.  There were no such dramas for top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne, who won her opening match comfortably, beating Samantha Reeves 6-2 6-2.  Jill Craybas - in as a late replacement for Jennifer Capriati - saw her run ended by Spain's Conchita Martinez who won 6-0 6-3.  Henin-Hardenne will play Marta Marrero in the third round after the Spaniard beat Zimbabwe's Cara Black 7-6 6-1.
