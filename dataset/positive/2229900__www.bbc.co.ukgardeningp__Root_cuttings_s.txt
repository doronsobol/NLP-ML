Common Name: Bleeding heart   Genus: Dicentra   Species: spectabilis   Skill Level: Beginner   Exposure: Full sun, Partial shade   Hardiness: Hardy   Soil type: Well-drained/light, Clay/heavy, Acidic, Chalky/alkaline   Height: 60cm   Spread: 45cm   Time to divide plants: March to May     A Chinese plant with red heart-shaped flowers with white tips - these dangle enticingly from the arching flower stems of this delightful plant in late spring and early summer. Although it grows in light shade and looks good growing in clumps amongst shrubs, it often does even better in a sunny border, provided the soil stays sufficiently moist. Clumps of dicentra remain compact for many years and do not need dividing, fortunately, because they have brittle roots and do not like disturbance - instead, try taking root cuttings in spring. The Royal Horticultural Society has given it its Award of Garden Merit (AGM).
