Kewell, 27, limped out after 23 minutes but has now told the Daily Mirror: "Everybody thought I had thrown it in.  "I could not believe the reaction from some people. I did not realise there were so many qualified doctors watching the match. My groin just snapped.  "Some were saying my heart wasn't in it or I just wanted to go off."  Kewell was replaced by Vladimir Smicer and did not play again until he turned out for Liverpool's reserves on 27 September.  But the Australia international, who has a long history of injury problems, was unhappy with the way people jumped to conclusions.  "Even before the story was out properly they had diagnosed me and decided I had quit," he added.  "Do people know I was the number one penalty taker on the pitch that night in Istanbul?  "So why would I want to walk off in a game when I had a real chance of getting on the scoresheet?"
