The Pleasureland in Southport first opened in 1912 and looked set to disappear when the owners, Blackpool Pleasure Beach, decided to close it down in 2006 and dismantle the rides.  Although the long term future of the 25 acre site still remains in doubt, the funfair was re-opened two years ago by Norman Wallis, whose family have been in the industry for seven generations.  He says he has invested money into refurbishing the Wildcat due to popular demand and hopes that the fairground can evolve into an amusement park to rival anything on the continent and the USA.
