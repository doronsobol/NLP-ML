Many of England's historic sites - some of which played key roles defending the country in past centuries - were given new roles during World War One. Tudor castles came to the defence of the nation once again, while country houses helped wounded soldiers recover.  The ancient stones at Stonehenge found themselves at the centre of the world's largest military camp. English Heritage is telling the story in a new exhibition at the site in Wiltshire, which runs until April 2015.
