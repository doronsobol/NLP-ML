Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy and his fiancee Sarra Kemp have married in Edinburgh.  Sir Chris, 34, won three gold medals at the Beijing Olympics and is Scotland's most successful-ever Olympian.  He had been engaged to Miss Kemp, a lawyer, for about a year prior to the wedding ceremony on Saturday.  Olympic swimming double gold medallist Rebecca Adlington was among the guests at the service in the city's St Giles Cathedral.  The Edinburgh-born cyclist, wearing a grey kilt with sporran and grey jacket, posed briefly on the kirk steps with his wife, who wore a white wedding dress with veil.  The couple had kept the service a closely-guarded secret, with guests reportedly in the dark until the last minute over the venue plans.
