Darren Moore missed the crucial penalty as Derby's poor start to the season continued as they went out of the Carling Cup to Blackpool on spot-kicks.  Mo Camara's cross-shot went in to hand Derby a 62nd-minute lead but Kaspars Gorkss headed the game into extra-time.  Craig Fagan restored the Rams's lead with a neat header from Gary Teale's cross but another Gorkss header ensured the match went to a penalty shoot-out.  And Blackpool won through 7-6, Michael Jackson keeping cool for the winner.
