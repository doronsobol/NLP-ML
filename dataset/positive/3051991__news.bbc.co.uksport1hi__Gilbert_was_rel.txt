Yeovil Town have extended the loan deal of Watford forward Gavin Massey by a further month.  The 19-year-old has been at Huish Park since September and has scored three goals in 16 appearances.  Meanwhile, the Glovers have decided to release four players.  Defender Kerrea Gilbert, midfielder Flavien Belson and wingers Abdulai Bell-Baggie and Alan O'Brien have been told they will not be receiving new deals at the League One club.  All four players were signed by Terry Skiverton in the summer but found first-team opportunities limited.
