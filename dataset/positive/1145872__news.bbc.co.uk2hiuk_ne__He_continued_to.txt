The prince has played polo for 40 years, but only in charity matches since 1992.  A spokesman from Clarence House said the prince had recently decided it was the right time to retire "gracefully, but regretfully".  Prior to 1992, the prince played for competitive teams, and has raised more than Â£12m while playing in charity matches since.  The prince, who celebrated his 57th birthday on Monday, broke his right arm badly in a fall during a polo match in 1990, which required lengthy treatment.  He suffered a fall again in a charity match in 2001 when he fell awkwardly from his horse and fell briefly unconscious, but was not injured.  The prince also fell from his horse earlier this year.  The Prince of Wales has passed his enthusiasm for the sport to his sons William and Harry, who are both known to be keen players.  And one of the most significant events of his life, meeting now-wife Camilla, happened at a polo match when he was 23.  An often-printed image of the pair shows them in front of a tree in conversation with the prince still in his polo outfit.
