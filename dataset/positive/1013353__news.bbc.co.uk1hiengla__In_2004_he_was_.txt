An Old Bailey jury took just an hour to clear Neil Horan, 57, from Nunhead, south London.  He then performed an Irish jig in his Irish national costume outside the court in celebration.  Mr Horan, who disrupted the men's Olympic marathon this year, denied exposing himself to the girl in his bedsit in 1991.  He has not worked in a church for 10 years but stages stunts to publicise his beliefs about the second coming and the end of the world.  He stepped in front of the leader in the men's Olympic marathon race, possibly costing him the gold medal.  And last year he was jailed for two months for disrupting the British Grand Prix race at Silverstone by running on to the track in front of speeding cars.  Mr Horan agreed he was naked but denied getting the child to touch him.  During his defence, Mr Horan broke down after calling on God to "strike me down" if he was lying.  After being cleared, he said: "It is the happiest day of my life.  "As for the women who accused me, I wish them well.  "But there is a lesson to be learned for other priests, who should be careful not to get too close to women they deal with."  Horan said he would not be disrupting any more sporting events.  A statement by the Archdiocese of Southwark said: "Neil Horan's faculties to practise as a priest were formally withdrawn on health grounds."
