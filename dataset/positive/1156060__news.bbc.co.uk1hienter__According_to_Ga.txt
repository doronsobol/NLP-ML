Oasis star Noel Gallagher has revealed that his most famous song was not written about his ex-wife, Meg Mathews.  Speaking in a documentary to be broadcast on BBC Radio 2 this weekend, the guitarist - who writes much of the band's material - said people wrongly assumed the hit single Wonderwall was about Mathews.  "The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it," said Gallagher.  "And how do you tell your Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself."  Gallagher and Mathews were married in 1997 and had a daughter, Anais, but they divorced last year.  Gallagher also says in the documentary that he would not put up with his brother Liam if he was not a member of his family.  "I'll tell you this - and he knows this - if I wasn't related to him, I wouldn't be in a band with him," he said.  The band's latest album, Heathen Chemistry, was released earlier this year.  It has so far spawned three hit singles, including chart-topper The Hindu Times. Follow-ups Stop Crying Your Heart Our and Little By Little both reached number two.  The album has so far sold more than 600,000 copies in the UK and more than one million in Europe.  However, Gallagher revealed that the arrangements for a follow-up album had yet to be confirmed.  "I'm having a bit of time off - I need to move house again, and we haven't got enough songs for an album," he said.  "Anyway, our record deal is up for the next album, so I'm not really sure about record companies or record deals, or whether we need one, whether we want one."
