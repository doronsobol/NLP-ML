Kidderminster came from behind to beat 10-man Leyton Orient and end the visitors' three-game winning run.  The O's were in front after 19 minutes when teenage striker Jabo Ibehre chested down a long throw-in from Andy Harris, turned marker Lee Ayres before planting a low shot wide of goalkeeper Stuart Brock.  Harriers drew level in the 39th minute when a long clearance from Brock evaded the Orient defence and Dean Bennett headed over advancing keeper Scott Barrett.  Five minutes later the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Chris Tate was sent off for a late tackle on Bennett.  Ibehre notched his second of the afternoon on the hour mark, however, when he headed past Brock following a mix-up in the home defence.  But Kidderminster hit back, with Sam Shilton on hand to poke home the rebound after Bo Henriksen's shot was only parried by Barrett.  And then, with just six minutes to go, Henriksen chipped the keeper from the edge of the area to snatch the points.
