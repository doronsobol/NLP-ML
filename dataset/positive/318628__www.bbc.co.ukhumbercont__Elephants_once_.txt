Pupils from Pearson Primary School had a practical history lesson walking down the city’s Spring Bank retracing the Elephant Walk.  The trail commemorates the route taken by an elephant at the city’s old Zoological Gardens. Each day he would be walked from his stables to the zoo grounds. The route features newly installed paving stones with carvings of elephants.  Caroline Hansard, a teacher at the school, said the project was designed to give children an insight to a little known part of local history. “A lot of them can’t imagine anything other than the houses, or the shops or the road.”  The Hull Zoological Gardens existed between 1840 and 1862 and covered most of Spring Bank. Its memory remains in the names of many of the local pubs, such as the Polar Bear.  Residents of a local street have also commemorated the area’s history with street sculptures of hippos and elephants.
