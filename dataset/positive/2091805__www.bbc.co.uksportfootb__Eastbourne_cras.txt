Braintree made history with a seven-goal hammering of National League South side Eastbourne to reach the FA Cup second round for the first time.  The game was effectively wrapped up in a clinical opening 21 minutes from the Iron, who are currently 22nd in the National League.  They took the lead after just six minutes when Monty Patterson scored as he followed up Michael Cheek's back-post header which was saved by Lewis Carey.  The lead was doubled five minutes later as Patterson's corner was met by the head of former Wolves defender George Elokobi.  The third goal came in the 21st minute when Oli Muldoon's free-kick took a deflection and the ball rolled into the net.  Eastbourne attacked but struggled to find the target and Lee Barnard made it 4-0 in the 68th minute as he scored from close range after Sim Akinola's lob over Carey hit the post.  Barnard bagged a second six minutes later from the penalty spot after Akinola was fouled, before Elokobi added the sixth after heading in another corner.  The rout was completed by stand-in skipper Akinola as he curled home a beautiful effort late on.
