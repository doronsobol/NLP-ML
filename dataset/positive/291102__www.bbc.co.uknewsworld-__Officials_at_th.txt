Russia has not put its clocks back for winter this year, after President Dmitry Medvedev decided the country would stay permanently in summertime.  Mr Medvedev announced his decision in March, saying it was in order to relieve the stress of changing clocks.  Officials at the time talked about an annual increase in suicides.  It means that this winter in Russia the mornings will be darker for longer, but there will be more daylight in the afternoons.  So, as almost all of Northern Europe set its clocks back overnight, Russia did nothing, opting instead to remain on summertime for the whole year.  But because Russia is almost alone in sticking to summertime it has meant that businesses like banks, and in particular airlines and railways, have had an extra complication this autumn.
