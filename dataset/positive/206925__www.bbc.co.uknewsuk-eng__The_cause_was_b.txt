Up to 700 people were evacuated from London Marylebone station after a fire onboard a train that pulled into a platform.  An air conditioning unit is believed to have caught fire, police said. No injuries were reported.  Light smoke could be seen on the concourse and appeared to be coming from platform one, BBC World Service presenter Danny Cox said.  The station was evacuated shortly after 21:00 GMT and five fire crews were called to the station.  "There's been nothing but calm from the start", Mr Cox said.  Chiltern Railways services to the Home Counties and West Midlands have been affected.
