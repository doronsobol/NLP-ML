The proposed new home for the Bees is close to their current Griffin Park ground, which would be redeveloped into residential housing if they relocate.  "This is a major milestone and a huge step forward," said chairman Greg Dyke.  "Our aim is to move into a new stadium in Lionel Road and to move there as a club free of debt."  The land in question was identified by Brentford in 2002 as their preferred site for their new home.  Dyke added: "We need a modern new stadium, to keep the club in Brentford, and we want a brighter financial future which will mean we can compete more effectively in the Football League. This deal will help us do all three.  "There's still a lot of work to be done but today is a big day in the history of Brentford Football Club."
