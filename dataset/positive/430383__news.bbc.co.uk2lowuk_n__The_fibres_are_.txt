The fibres are coarser, however.

It is hoped the "nettle knickers" is the first step towards a commercial application for the plants.  Leicester's De Montfort University's "Sting" project is researching potential for nettle fibre as a crop and market.  The research is funded by Defra; and the Central Science Laboratory, in York, is also involved in the project.  Textile design student Alex Dear, 23, from Cambridge, wrote a dissertation on nettle fibre as part of a three-year textile design and production degree.  She has been modelling the camisole and knickers, which she designed herself.  She said: "I investigated and tested the fibres and had the yarn made up.  Nettle yarn was used to make rucksacks for soldiers in the First World War.  Ms Dear said: "It's not terribly comfortable when it's next to your skin, so anything you made from it would probably have to be lined.  Ray Harwood, Professor of Textile Engineering at De Montfort University, said nettles had great potential.  "I am sure it would find a place in corporate clothing, workwear and the like."
