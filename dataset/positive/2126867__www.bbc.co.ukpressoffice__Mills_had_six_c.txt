For the past two weeks BBC Radio 1's Scott Mills has given listeners an insight into the behind-the-scenes action of his show via a webcam that had been set up at a desk in the Radio 1 offices.  Now, for one week (Monday 29 September to Friday 3Â October) he will be opening the doors to his whole life as webcams are installed in his home, capturing his every move.  Scott will be hosting his daily show (4.00-7.00pm) live from his living room and when the show is over viewers will be able to carry on watching Scott via the webcams at bbc.co.uk/radio1.  To make it a truly interactive experience the audience can email Scott (radio1cam@bbc.co.uk) as they watch him and can choose which cameras to view in different parts of Scott's house.  Celebrities over the past fortnight including The Pussycat Dolls, James Morrison, Jo Whiley, Dita Von Teese, Pete Tong, and Sara Cox have all taken a turn at the webcam in the Radio 1 offices and Scott will have more surprise guests dropping by this week.
