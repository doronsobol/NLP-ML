Titanic First Officer William Murdoch was one of more than 1,600 people who died when the luxury liner sank in the Atlantic in 1912.  William Murdoch is remembered as a hero in his home town of Dalbeattie, but his nephew, Scott, is concerned that the film will tarnish his reputation.  "If someone says to you somebody in the family committed suicide when he hadn't, you take objection."  But Eleanor Schuman, now in her 80s, is more impressed by the movie. As a 16-month-old toddler, she was one of the 752 passengers who survived when the Titanic hit the iceberg.  Mrs Schuman, who has seen the film at special screenings, said: "I kept saying to myself, 'I was there', but it is hard to pin it to those things mum told me about.  "I've seen it twice and I thought it was wonderful."
