Kevin Brennan was an Oxford contemporary of William Hague, indeed he succeeded him as President of the Union, but their subsequent careers have gone down very different paths.  Brennan entered the crucible of Welsh Labour politics, becoming chairman of Cardiff Council's economic scrutiny committee.  He also became the right hand man of his predecessor as Cardiff West's MP, Rhodri Morgan.  When loyalties were tested with the initial contest between Alun Michael and Rhodri Morgan, Brennan sided with Morgan rather than the leadership's choice.  On the left of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Brennan has also said that he "would have found it difficult to vote for a cut in lone parents' benefits."  Mr Brennan was instrumental in extracting the government's commitment to establish a Â£400million fund to provide compensation for workers who lost pensions when their firms went bankrupt.  Along with the ISTC union, Mr Brennan had been lobbying the government to provide for such protection since the collapse of Allied Steel and Wire in 2002 when hundreds of steelworkers in Cardiff lost both their jobs and their pensions.  Prior to this, his most high-profile intervention was when he appeared in the Commons chamber without a tie in order to call for a less formal dress code for MPs.  He is currently a member of the Public Administration Select Committee and the Northern Ireland Grand Committee.
