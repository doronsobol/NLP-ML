The 25-year-old follows Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, who signed new deals earlier in the week.  "It was always my wish to sign a new deal because this is a good club which is looking forward to a very ambitious and attractive project," said Reina.  Boss Rafa Benitez said: "Pepe's record at Liverpool is very good. He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world."  Spain international Reina joined Liverpool from Primera Liga side Villarreal for Â£6m in July 2005.  And Benitez added: "We knew we needed to talk with a number of our players and Pepe was one of them.  "He has had two good years with us and, because of his age, we knew we had to sort out a long contract.  "Pepe's record at Liverpool is very good. He's had a lot of clean sheets and you can see the confidence the defenders have in him.  "When he plays, the defenders look very comfortable and that is so important."  Reina, who is the established first choice at Anfield, has an excellent record of saving penalties.  He made several crucial penalty saves as Liverpool beat West Ham to win the 2006 FA Cup and as the Reds beat Chelsea in a shoot out in their Champions League semi-final.  And the keeper is now looking for the club to mount a serious Premiership title challenge next season.  "I spoke with Rafa and his thoughts for the future really excited me," added Reina.  "He has ambitions for the team which I want to be part of and I'm sure the other players feel the same.  "The idea now for all of us is to keep winning matches and to challenge for titles. That's what we'll be looking for from the start of next season.  "Our fans deserve the league title and that's what we'll be looking for. Seventeen years without winning it is far too long for this club and that's why our biggest target next year has to be the Premiership."
