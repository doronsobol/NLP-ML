Eubank was charged after he tried to park his seven-tonne truck outside the gates to Downing Street in May in protest at UK policy in Iraq.  Eubank, 41, from Hove, East Sussex, was due to appear at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.  The former world champion was also ordered to pay Â£380 costs. He has 14 days to pay.  Eubank was charged under the Serious and Organised Crime Act, relating to the staging of a unlawful demonstration in a designated area.  During the incident he drove his truck emblazoned with a message calling on Gordon Brown to withdraw troops from Iraq.  It read: "Mr Brown, you know that the policy in Iraq cannot succeed. Democracy cannot be exported with a gun. You can be the great leader and the great peace maker."  A smaller sign read: "This is not a protest."  Mel Goldberg, Mr Eubank's agent, said on Friday his client was overseas and would not be back for a few days.  He said: "He will come back and face the music."
