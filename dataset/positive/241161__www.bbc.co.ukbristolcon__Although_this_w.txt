Although this was intended to be a joke, a number of fans petitioned the club to get the kit made for real, and also suggested that funds raised through the sale of the pink shirts should be donated to a breast cancer charity.

If you think it sounds like a practical joke, you're not far off the mark.  "It started as an April fools joke," said Ian Cole, IT manager at Bristol Rovers and the man behind the campaign. "We decided to put something on the website as a joke saying it would be our third strip and expecting fans not to like it.  But the fans did like it and signed petitions and pestered the club to bring it out for real." In fact it was a couple of fans who suggested donating the money raised to charity.  £4 from every adult shirt and £3 from every child shirt will be donated to breast cancer research in the area.  "The 'Think Pink' campaign stuck out as a great charity to support," said Ian. The shirts have already proved a massive success, with fans buying almost 550 in the last fortnight, raising nearly £2000.  "We thought we might sell about 250 so we have already more than doubled that and we've still got a couple of weeks to go," Ian said. The club will stop taking orders for the pink shirts at the end of the month, but an order form in this Saturday’s match program is sure to boost sales. Although Bristol Rovers often donate signed kits of footballs to local charities, this is the first time they have been involved in a campaign like this. "This is quite a unique venture," said Ian.  "We didn't plan it but it seemed like a good idea at the time." In fact it has proved so popular that the club might be having another shot at it again soon – keep your fingers crossed for a chance to see the Rovers team kitted out in pink for a friendly next season.
