The Castle in the Community organisation is looking to restore Hylton Castle after it has lain in ruins for 50 years.  English Heritage has given £50,000 towards planning costs but public donations are needed.  The castle is the second oldest building in the city and is reportedly haunted by a murdered stable boy.  John Coulthard, chair of Castle in the Community, said: "What we're really looking for is to bring it into use.  "If it is being used it will be better maintained and not so vandalised.  "It is an asset in the city - it is a lovely setting and we would love to see it bring in some income."  The legend of a ghost has long been associated with the castle.  It is believed a stable boy was killed by a baron after he overslept and failed to prepare a horse.  Members of the public will now be asked for their views on restoring the castle before a business plan is drawn up.
