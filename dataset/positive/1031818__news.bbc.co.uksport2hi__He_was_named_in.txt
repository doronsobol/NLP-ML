The choice was made by Uefa's eight-man technical study group, plus one vote from the organisers' official website.  The 32-year-old won his 95th cap - a joint national record - as the Greeks beat hosts Portugal 1-0 in Lisbon on Sunday to win the tournament.  Zagorakis produced a series of impressive displays during the competition as part of a three-man midfield that shielded the back four.  The former Leicester City midfielder will be presented with his award at a gala in Monaco on 26 August.  Uefa has also announced their 23-man squad for the tournament, with England stars Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney featuring.  "The idea is to recognise the top performers that have graced the event," said Uefa technical director Andy Roxburgh.  "It's been a difficult choice, but we finally came to a collective decision. The team is based on the tournament and not on reputation."  Goalkeepers: Petr Cech (Czech Republic), Antonios Nikopolidis (Greece).    Defenders: Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole (both England), Traianos Dellas, Georgios Seitaridis (both Greece), Olof Mellberg (Sweden), Ricardo Carvalho (Portugal), Gianluca Zambrotta (Italy).    Midfielders: Michael Ballack (Germany), Luis Figo, Maniche (both Portugal), Frank Lampard (England), Pavel Nedved (Czech Republic), Theo Zagorakis (Greece), Zinedine Zidane (France).    Forwards: Milan Baros (Czech Republic), Wayne Rooney (England), Angelos Charisteas (Greece), Henrik Larsson (Sweden), Ruud van Nistelrooy (Holland), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Jon Dahl Tomasson (Denmark).
