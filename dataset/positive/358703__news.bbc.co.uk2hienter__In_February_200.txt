In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.

The relatives of South African Solomon Linda, who wrote the original Zulu tune, settled with the US owners of the copyright who had loaned it to Disney.  The dispute over royalties arose when the song was used in The Lion King.  Linda, who died in poverty in 1962, composed the song in 1939 and recorded it with The Evening Birds.  His family contested that Disney was liable to pay almost £1m for using the song, which was used in The Lion King film and stage musical.  Mr Linda sold the copyright to a local firm in 1939, but his lawyers said it should have reverted to his heirs 25 years after his death in 1962.  It has been recorded by at least 150 artists around the world, and became one of the most popular tunes in Africa.  Tight Fit were among the acts that covered the song, which topped the UK charts in 1982.  The song has reportedly earned more than $15m (£8.4m) because of its use in the The Lion King movies, but Mr Linda's family received $15,000 (£8,400).  The settlement involves back payment of royalties to the family and the right to participate in future payments on a worldwide basis.
