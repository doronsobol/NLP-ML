The distinguished history of RAF Duxford is to be told in a new interactive exhibition.  It is the first permanent display specifically dedicated to the airfield and those stationed there.  RAF Duxford was a fighter station during World War II and is now part of the Imperial War Museum.  The new exhibition will be housed in the former Watch Office which oversaw the airfield and is planned to open in late 2012.  RAF Duxford opened as a training station towards the end of World War I.  During the following war, the airfield achieved fame as a fighter station and was the first RAF base to operate the Spitfire.  During its history, Duxford has also served as a USAAF fighter base before being taken over by the Imperial War Museum in the 1970s.  The new display, called Historic Duxford, will be housed in the old Watch Office.  In the 1930s this building was manned by the Duty Pilot who observed each day's flying activities.  Built in 1918, it will be restored to its former glory and will tell Duxford's story through the eyes of the men and women who worked at the iconic fighter station.  The exhibition will combine period reconstructions with state-of-the-art interactive displays and real objects.  Focusing on those who served on the base, hundreds of hours of memories of ex-Duxford personnel will also be available.  The exhibition's team are hoping more people with memories of the Duxford will get involved.  A meeting for community feedback is being held on Thursday, 10 March at 1900 GMT.  It will take place in the Marshall Auditorium in AirSpace at Imperial War Museum Duxford.  Have you got a story to tell about RAF Duxford? Tell us about it at cambridgeshire@bbc.co.uk
