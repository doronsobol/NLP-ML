The pair will not be offered new contracts by the Stamford Bridge club.  Morris will become a free agent on 30 June, but Chelsea may try and point him towards Rovers' boss Graeme Souness as part of package to tempt Blackburn to part with David Dunn.  The 36-year-old De Goey was signed by former Blues boss Ruud Gullit in 1997 and established himself as number one goalkeeper at Stamford Bridge.  In the 1999-2000 season, the Dutch international kept a club record 29 clean sheets and made a Chelsea record number of 59 appearances in one campaign.  But the emergence of Carlo Cudicini edged De Goey out and the Dutchman fell even further down the pecking order after Chelsea's recent capture of Austrian international Jurgen Macho from Sunderland on a free transfer.
