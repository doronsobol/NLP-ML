League One side Exeter City have handed a new contract to Wales international defender Richard Duffy.  The 25-year-old, who joined Exeter two years ago from Millwall, has made 94 appearances, scoring four times.  "I always wanted to stay," he told the club website. "The club has been good for me and I've fitted in well.  "I've kept injury-free across the two seasons and, if you do that, you can get on these good runs where your form and fitness improve."
