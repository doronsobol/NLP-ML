The incidents all happened in the London area over four weeks in June and July.  The two men were taken to police stations in north London after being arrested in Birmingham, the Metropolitan Police said.  Police also carried out two raids on addresses in south London. No arrests were made but several people attended police stations voluntarily.  Two of the dead were mothers who were both shot dead in their homes at the end of June.  Avril Johnson, from Brixton, south London, and Michelle Carby, from Stratford in east London, were shot in the head in separate attacks five days apart.  Ferguson was also shot in his home, in Kingsbury, north west London, after three men broke in.  Police have also linked the incidents to an armed rape which took place in a couple's flat in the Clapham area of south London on 15 June.  A woman was raped in the attack and a man received serious stab injuries, police said at the time. The couple were also robbed.  Two people have already been charged with the murder of Avril Johnson and with the rape of the woman in Clapham.
