Advani, 27, repeated his 2009 victory against Russell, the 43-year-old Englishman, now settled in Qatar, who has won 10 titles himself.  India's Rupesh Shah also won the title in the 150-up points format, defeating Australia's Matthew Bolton in the final on Saturday.  Advani defeated Russell by 1895-1216, after leading at the half-way mark in the final on Sunday night.
