A drug dealer caught at a train station in Berkshire with £200,000 worth of sedatives in a suitcase has been jailed for 15 months at Reading Crown Court.  James Docherty, 52, from Glasgow, was spotted acting suspiciously at Slough station by a police community support officer last September.  He found 200,000 tablets in the case - thought to be the most found by British Transport Police from one passenger.  Docherty admitted possessing Class C drugs with intent to supply.  Tests revealed the tablets were diazepam, a sedative sometimes sold under the brand-name Valium, with a street resale value of £1 each.  Dan Sykes, a cycle patrol officer, said he held Docherty after seeing a small number of tablets spill out of the suitcase on a staircase on 30 September last year.  He caught the drugs runner frantically trying to stuff them back inside and when asked what they were, Docherty replied "Temazepam".  Docherty claimed to work in a pharmaceuticals factory and said he was taking them to be destroyed.  PCSO Sykes said: "One minute you're handing out information about cycle crime and the next you've stopped a major drug dealer."
