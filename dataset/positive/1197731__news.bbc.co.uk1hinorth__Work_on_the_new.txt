Funding has been allocated to Translink to upgrade the Larne service which has faced passenger complaints.  Marketing manager Ciaran Rogan said the investment would help improve the quality of service.  "The budget, which has been passed by the assembly, gives us funding to purchase 20 new trains to replace nine older ones," he said.  "We would use those nine trains on the Larne line so they will be completely replaced, but it allows us to increase our level of service across the network.  "When we receive the funding we will have to go out to public tender: this process which takes about 12 months, and thereafter it will be about 24 months before the trains start arriving."
