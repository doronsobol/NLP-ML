From the FA Cup to the World Cup, our resident expert Albert keeps abreast of all things football, and is on hand to answer your questions.  Do you need to settle a bet? Are you having sleepless nights trying to remember who scored where, when and for whom?  Let Albert do the work. Test him with your footballing teasers.  What is the longest that a side has gone without conceding a goal?  The British shut-out record has stood for 15 years. In season 1986-87, Rangers' England keeper Chris Woods went 1196 minutes in all competitions, from November to January, without conceding a goal.  When England won the World Cup in 1966, how many of their players appeared in every game?  England used 15 players in that Final series and eight of them appeared in all six matches: Gordon Banks, Jack Charlton, Bobby Charlton, George Cohen, Roger Hunt, Bobby Moore (captain), Nobby Stiles and Ray Wilson.  How long have Arsenal been in the top division?  Arsenal hold the record for the longest ongoing membership of the First Division and subsequent Premier League. It dates from season 1919-1920.  Who scored for QPR against West Bromwich Albion in the 1968 League Cup final?  Those clubs met in the 1967 final, the first time the League Cup was decided at Wembley. The result was Rangers 3 (Roger Morgan, Rodney Marsh, Mark Lazarus), Albion 2 (Clive Clarke twice). Alec Stock's Rangers came back from two down to win, and went on to complete a double that season, as Third Division champions.  Which club holds the record for making the most FA Cup semi-final appearances without reaching the final?  There are four such clubs - Millwall, Norwich, Oldham and Stoke City, each with three semi-finals to their name and never a final. That is astonishing for Stoke, considering they were founder members of the Football League in 1888. But they did win the league Cup in 1972.  What is the highest ever score draw ever recorded and which teams were involved?  Two 6-6 draws is the all-time league record. The first was between Leicester City and Arsenal in Division One on 21 April 1930, and the next was 30 years later, Charlton v Middlesbrough in Division Two on 22 October 1960. Time we had another, methinks.  To settle a bet, for which club out of Norwich City and Blackburn Rovers did Chris Sutton score the most goals?  In all first-class matches, Chris scored 43 goals for Norwich (1991-94) and 59 for Blackburn (1994-99).  How long ago did the Premiership start and which teams have won it?  The Premier League began in 1992-93, so this is its tenth campaign. Manchester United have been champions seven times (1993, 94, 96, 97, 99, 2000 and 01), Blackburn Rovers once (1995) and Arsenal once (1998).  Has anyone ever scored a hat-trick of own goals?  It may have happened elsewhere in the world, but the most own goals by one player in a league match in England is two. This unwanted record is held by two players: Aston Villa's Chris Nicholl, away to Leicester (2-2) in Division One on 20 March 1976 - he also scored Villa's two goals that day - and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher in the 2-3 home defeat against Manchester United (Premiership) on 11 September 1999.  My pub team recently played a cup match that went to penalties, and some players complained that the penalty they scored did not go on their tally for the season. I said I didn't think penalties after extra time counted in that way. Please could you help?  Strange as it may seem, in first-class football (Where tournaments can be won and lost like that), goals scored in penalty shoot-outs are not included in a player's career details. Neither are own goals.
