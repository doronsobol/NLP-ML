The 33-year-old has been on loan at Highbury since August 2005 as part of the deal taking young full-back Justin Hoyte to Sunderland.  Now he has made his move permanent, signing an undisclosed contract despite having failed to represent the Gunners' first team so far this season.  "I am really pleased that Arsene Wenger and the coaches have shown faith in me," Poom told Arsenal's website.  "I'm really enjoying it here at Arsenal and will continue to work hard in training, so that I am ready to hopefully feature in the first team in the near future."  The Estonia goalkeeper was signed by Arsene Wenger as back-up for Jens Lehmann and Manuel Almunia.
