Anti-UKIP protesters have invaded a pub in south London where party leader Nigel Farage was having lunch.  Mr Farage was in the Queen's Head in Downe with his wife and two younger children at the time.  Demonstrators first went to the George & Dragon, believing it to be Mr Farage's local, before they found him.  They said they chased the family out of the pub and jumped on the politician's car bonnet as he drove away. Mr Farage later branded them "scum".  Mr Farage, who is standing in Kent's South Thanet constituency in May's general election, said: "I hope these 'demonstrators' are proud of themselves. My children were so scared by their behaviour that they ran away to hide.  "... A relative has gone to look for them, and they are not yet at home. These people are scum."  Mr Farage's children aged 15 and 10 were understood to have later been found.  Protest organiser Dan Glass said the group was in fancy dress to stage "a cabaret of diversity" and included migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mothers.  He said about 100 people took part, and added: "UKIP are a con. They pretend to be anti-establishment but this couldn't be further from the truth.  "By wrongfully shifting the blame for the economic crisis on to immigrants they have let the bankers off the hook."  He said that was why the "diverse communities" had taken their cultures to Mr Farage's local pub.  Staff at the Queen's Head refused to comment. The George & Dragon said protesters had initially claimed they were there for a birthday party.
