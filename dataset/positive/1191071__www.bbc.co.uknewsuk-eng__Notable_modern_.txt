A former cricket club captain has been nicknamed Paddles by teammates after being bowled out without scoring a run for the eighth time in a row.  More than two years have passed since Rob Pritchard, a mid-order batsman, scored runs for the Ingatestone and Fryerning Cricket Club.  Mr Pritchard, once the captain of the club's second XI, said: "Yes, it is funny, but not for me."  He said he hopes to score at the weekend against Great Totham.  Ingatestone and Fryerning Cricket Club's second XI play in the T.Rippon Mid Essex League.  Two of the eight ducks notched by Mr Pritchard, who works for West Ham United, were "golden ducks" - which means he was given out on the very first delivery against him.  He has been bowled five times and caught three times.  The last time he scored was on 28 May 2011 when he made 17 runs against Navestock.  Teammate Matthew Taylor said: "Rob is no lower order batsman and this is a really treacherous run for him this season.  "However he seems more determined than ever to end this run of bad form.  "We have Great Totham Saturday and he is already in the side wanting to end his drought.  "It has come to the point that now as a club we cringe when he goes into bat."
