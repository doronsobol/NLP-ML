The Reds came back from 3-0 down to beat AC Milan in last week's final. As it was the fifth time they had won, they were allowed to keep the cup.  It's thought the handle got dented when striker Milan Baros dropped the cup at the team's hotel in Turkey.  But the club says the dent is staying put because it won't be mending it.  "We decided not to get it repaired because it is part of the character of the cup," said the curator of the club museum at Anfield, where the trophy is now on show.
