A private school for foreign students in Kent is to close at the end of the academic year, it has been announced.  The owners of the Bell Bedgebury School in Cranbrook said the market for international boarding schools had changed.  The school is owned by the Bell Educational Trust and has about 80 students.  Will Kinsman, the director of sales and marketing, said it had been a difficult decision.  He said: "We are very mindful of the impact on both staff and students.  "We are commencing a period of consultation with affected staff and will be exploring with them alternative opportunities within the broader Bell organisation."
