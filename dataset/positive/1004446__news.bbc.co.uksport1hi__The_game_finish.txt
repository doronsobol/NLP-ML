The Portugal winger, 20, was sent off for appearing to headbutt Richard Hughes in United's draw at Portsmouth.  Ferguson said: "Cristiano is responsible for falling into the trap of intimidation, which has happened to him a few times.  "I've seen the replay and there's nothing conclusive, my take is that he was provoked and he has fallen for it."  Ronaldo will miss three games, the standard ban for violent conduct, including Saturday's derby game with Manchester City.  It was his third red card since joining Manchester United, shown by referee Steve Bennett, who also came in for criticism from Ferguson.  The United boss said: "Steve Bennett sent him off at Manchester City and he will have loved the opportunity to send him off again.  "Carlos Tevez didn't get any protection either, I don't know how many times he got fouled from behind. He had to suffer a lot."  Portsmouth also had midfielder Sulley Muntari sent off after being shown two yellow cards.
