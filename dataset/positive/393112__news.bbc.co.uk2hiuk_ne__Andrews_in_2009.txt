New figures show the area has seen the largest price increase of any seaside town in Scotland over the period.  Eyemouth also features in the top ten for Great Britain, with the average house price rising from £71,000 in 2002 to just over £140,000 in 2005.  The most expensive seaside town in Scotland is North Berwick, with the most affordable being Wick.  Kirkcaldy and Dunoon joined Eyemouth as the Scottish towns seeing a rise of more than 75% in their house prices.  While North Berwick, St Andrews and Dunbar all had average prices now above £150,000.  A spokesman for the Bank of Scotland, which produced the figures, said the Eyemouth increase was part of a national trend.  "A growing number of Scottish home buyers want to own a piece of the seaside," said group economist Tim Crawford.  "This has meant that seaside towns have seen some of the strongest house price rises in the country over the past three years.  "Firm demand for second homes has clearly been a factor pushing up prices near the sea but regeneration efforts have also boosted house prices in seaside towns."
