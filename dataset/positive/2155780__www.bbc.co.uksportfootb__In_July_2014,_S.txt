Safet Susic has signed a new contract to remain as Bosnia-Hercegovina coach until the 2016 European Championships.  Susic hinted he would stand down after Bosnia's exit at the group stage of the World Cup but says he has "gained the support of the executive board".  Group F losses to Argentina and Nigeria ended Bosnia's World Cup hopes before a consolation win over Iran.  Bosnia face Cyprus, Belgium, Israel, Wales and Andorra in Euro 2016 qualifying, which begins in September.
