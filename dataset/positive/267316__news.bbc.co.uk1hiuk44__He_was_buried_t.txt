He will be buried in the Lichfield family vault at St Michael and All Angels Church - a short distance from Shugborough Hall, his ancestral home.  More than 170 family members, friends and staff from his estate and studio are expected to attend the service.  Graham Watson of the estate office said it would be "a low-key private service for family and very close friends".  No members of the Royal family were expected to attend, he added.  The family and congregation will return to Shugborough after the service.  Two memorial services will be held at a later date to celebrate Lord Lichfield's life and career.  One will be held at Lichfield Cathedral, while the other will take place at Wellington Barracks in central London.  Lord Lichfield, known professionally as Patrick Lichfield, died on 11 November at the age of 66 after suffering a major stroke.
