The Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) also allowed his Kiwi colleague Nigel Vagana to switch teams.  "The World Cup is a chance for them to show commitment to their heritage," said RLIF chairman Colin Love.  Samoa face the USA in a play-off match in Widnes on 9 November, with the winners qualifying for the World Cup.  Another experienced Kiwi international, Penrith forward Tony Puleta, has also switched sides to Samoa.  Palea'aesina's Wigan team-mate Harrison Hansen, who has yet to make his Test debut for New Zealand, is also considering playing for the Pacific Islanders.  The RLIF also ruled that Tongan internationals Fuifui Moimoi and Taneila Tuiaki can now represent New Zealand.  They will be eligible for Sunday week's Test against Australia and the historic All Golds tour of Britain after Tonga coach Jim Dymock said he would not object.  "We were confident everything was in order but the NZRL also had a process to go through with the RLIF," said Kiwi coach Gary Kemble.  "While it took a while for the decision to be made, we're pleased it has worked out the way we expected it to.  "Now Fuifui and Taniela can get on with preparing for their Kiwi Test debuts in the Centenary Test."
