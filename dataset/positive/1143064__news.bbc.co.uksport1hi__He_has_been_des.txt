Parlour - nicknamed "the Romford Pele" by team-mates - broke into the Arsenal first team in 1992 and soon became a favourite with the fans for his high-energy performances in midfield.  The 31-year-old has enjoyed remarkable success during his time at the club, winning a league cup, three league titles and two FA Cups as well as playing in the Champions League and Uefa Cup.  Often regarded as one of the club's unsung heroes, Parlour had arguably his finest moment in the 2002 FA Cup final when his superb 30-yard strike helped Arsenal to a 2-0 win over Chelsea.  In addition to his successful career at club level, Parlour won 10 England caps although he never really established himself at international level.  "I've been at Arsenal 13 years - it's just part of my make-up," said Parlour in 2003.  "There's always speculation about me moving somewhere and the removal van turns up outside my house every summer, but nothing ever happens."
