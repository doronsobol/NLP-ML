On that occasion, producers used the residential quarters of the East Gatehouse, Constable's Hall and Broase Gallery for the filming of a dungeon in the fictional Broadfell Prison.

Dominating the town, Caerphilly Castle was constructed in the late 13th century, and is the largest castle in Wales. It was built principally to stop the advance of Prince Llwelyn ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd by the nobleman Gilbert de Clare.  The 5th Marquess of Bute presented the sandstone castle to the British Government in 1950, since when it has undergone much restoration as a tourist attraction and as a venue licensed for weddings.  The residential quarters of the East Gatehouse, Constable's Hall and Broase Gallery were used by the BBC Wales team for a day's recording at the medieval venue on Monday 27 April 2009. Actress Alexandra Moen took centre stage, reprising her role of Lucy Saxon - the one-time wife of the Master - for her brief appearance in the tenth Doctor's finale, The End of Time.  The scenes of the Master's resurrection in the dungeon of Broadfell Prison were the main focus for the day - although John Simm was not present as the Master, meaning the returning Time Lord's dialogue was read in by a production runner - after which various prison corridor and cell sequences with the imprisoned Lucy were taped on the cold, rainy day.  The Doctor's failure to respond to the summons of the Ood allows his arch-enemy the Master to resurrect himself, but in a feral, dying, skeletal state. Kidnapped by the wealthy Joshua Naismith who believes that he can bestow the gift of immortality on his daughter, the Master hatches a plan to turn all humanity into versions of himself. The Doctor and Wilf Mott battle to foil his scheme as events spiral out of control and the Time Lords on Gallifrey are called back into existence.  Return to the Doctor Who in Wales map.
