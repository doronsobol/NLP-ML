Equitable Life came unstuck after making promises to policyholders that it could not afford to keep.  Here we chart the major events since the near collapse of the world's oldest life assurer in 2000.  In 1999, Equitable launched court proceedings to enable it to force policyholders to accept bonus cuts. It won the first stage of its battle only to lose in the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords.  Unable to pay the £1.5bn cost of losing the court case it was forced to put itself up for sale. In December 2000, having failed to find a buyer, the insurer closed to new business.  The most recent developments appear at the top of the timeline. Scroll to the bottom for the first entries.  20 October 2010 - Chancellor George Osborne announces that compensation of £1.5bn will be paid, with the first £1bn paid over three years. This includes £620m for those who had with-profits annuities. Campaigners describe the figure as "woefully inadequate".  22 July 2010 - The government announces that payouts will begin in mid-2011. It sets up an independent commission to advise how compensation will be paid.  Sir John Chadwick publishes his report, saying that the investors' absolute loss was between £2.9bn and £3.7bn but their compensation should be capped for each policyholder at between 20% and 25% of that. That would have implied a total payout of between £400m and £500m. The government says this report will be considered alongside other submissions.  4 June 2010 - Former Equitable auditors, Ernst and Young, are fined £500,000, plus costs of £2.4m, and reprimanded for failing to warn policyholders of the society's problems a decade earlier.  12 May 2010 - New coalition government says it will propose an "enhanced" compensation scheme in line with the Parliamentary Ombudsman's recommendations.  21 October 2009 - Labour government agrees proposed compensation scheme, being devised by Sir John Chadwick, should cover more people than originally planned  21 July 2009 - The Equitable Members Action Group goes to the High Court to call for a judicial review over the government's decision not to follow recommendations to offer full compensation to victims.  19 March 2009 - The public administration committee says it is "deeply disappointed" with the government's limited remedy scheme.  29 January 2009 - Parliamentary Ombudsman Ann Abraham says she is "astonished" at the government's "unsatisfactory" response to her report.  15 January 2009 - The government announces that it will compensate those policyholders "hardest hit" by the collapse. Former appeal court judge Sir John Chadwick will advise the government on who will receive payment and how much.

The report blames the UK government for failing to ensure that EU legislation on insurance had been implemented properly, and said the UK's financial regulators had been "excessively lenient" in failing to ensure that Equitable was solvent.  The MEPs acknowledge that they have no power to enforce their recommendations.  1 June 2007 - Equitable's sale of University Life to Reliance Mutual is completed.  22 May 2007 - Parliamentary Ombudsman Ann Abraham gives another progress update on her investigation.  In a letter to MPs she says the draft report she sent to the Treasury, the Government Actuary's Department and the Financial Services Authority in January 2007 prompted a "substantial" joint response running to more than 500 pages.  She says she will need "some time" to consider the response, and will therefore not publish her report before the summer recess as planned.

Sir Howard Davies and Ruth Kelly MP, economic secretary to the Treasury, were cross-examined by the Treasury select committee.  Sir Howard admitted that there had been management failures, but it was Equitable Life which was "arrogant" and had blocked attempts by the FSA to investigate its troubles.  Ms Kelly gave a glimmer of hope to policyholders by saying that the government might consider compensation for some victims if a "grave injustice" had occurred.  Report by FSA director of internal audit Ronnie Baird wrote the report, which investigated the FSA, PIA and Treasury's handling of Equitable between January 1999 and December 2000.
