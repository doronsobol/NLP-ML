Labour MP Frank Doran sparked outrage when his committee ruled that researchers and secretaries must allow MPs to jump the queue for the canteen.  Staff described the rules as "feudal", and complained they were being treated as second-class citizens.  Mr Doran said: "I don't want to damage relations between MPs and staff."  But he insisted that the reasons behind the ruling were sound.  "There is enormous pressure on our restaurant facilities in Parliament because of the large number of people now working here," he said.  "You cannot have an MP standing in a queue for ages: they are very busy people"  Mr Doran said MPs had always had queue-jumping rights, but a big increase in the number of Commons staff had made it necessary to remind people of the rules.  He acknowledged that the way in which staff were told about the ruling may have been better handled.  Mr Doran laid the blame on an email sent out by the Serjeant at Arms - the officer that handles staff matters in the House of Commons.  Signed by the Serjeant at Arms, Peter Grant Peterkin, and the House of Commons Director of Catering Services, Sue Harrison, it states: "With effect from today, staff and other users should be prepared to give way to Members when queuing for retail and catering services, the post office, travel office or when using other facilities such as lifts, photocopiers, telephone cubicles, etc.  "When using parliamentary facilities, please bear in mind whether there is, or is likely to be, a heavy demand from Members and, if so, try to amend your own plans or schedule."  The Serjeant at Arms declined to comment.
