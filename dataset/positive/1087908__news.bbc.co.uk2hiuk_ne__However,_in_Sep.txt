Pamela Jean Hinchliffe, 69, from Poole in Dorset, died at the firm's Fleetsbridge store in 2001.  Last summer B&Q was fined £550,000 and ordered to pay £250,000 costs.  At the appeal court on Tuesday, they failed to get the judgement overturned or the fine reduced. The company says it will not appeal again.  The judge agreed to reduce the firm's legal costs.  B&Q had been found guilty of five counts of breaching health and safety legislation and failing to ensure safe systems of work.  A company spokeswoman said: "We have learned lessons from this tragic accident and have put strict controls and procedures in place to ensure nothing like it happens again.  "We will not be making any further appeals."
