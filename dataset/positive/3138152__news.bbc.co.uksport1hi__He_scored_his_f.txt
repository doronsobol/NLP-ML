Inverness defied a late fightback from Falkirk to earn three points at the Caledonian Stadium.  Thistle dominated the early stages and Grant Munro headed them into the lead following Charlie Christie's free-kick after just 13 minutes.  Paul Ritchie then missed a great opportunity to extend the advantage when he fired wide from the penalty spot after Jamie McQuilken had handled the ball on the half-hour mark.  Against the run of play, Falkirk got back into the match when Kenny Deuchar turned home Gary McStay's corner to equalise two minutes before half-time.  Dennis Wyness restored Thistle's lead from a Martin Bavidge cross after 69 minutes and struck again four minutes later.  But the Bairns quickly responded and Ricky Waddle reduced their deficit with 14 minutes to go, but it proved not enough.
