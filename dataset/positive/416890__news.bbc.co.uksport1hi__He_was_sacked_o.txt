Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez will take over on a caretaker basis for the remainder of the season.  The Cottagers lie four points above the Premiership drop zone after a seven-game winless streak, but the sacking still comes as a surprise.  "It is disappointing that the club has no alternative but to part company [with Coleman]," read a club statement.  "Chris has provided a fantastic service during his 10 years at the club, but as a team and organisation Fulham Football Club has goals to attain and success to achieve - and by no means can this be compromised.  "After consultation with the Irish FA president Jim Boyce, it is agreed that Lawrie Sanchez will join as caretaker manager for the remaining five Premiership games of the season."  Coleman joined Fulham as a player in 1997 in a Â£2m move from Blackburn, but injuries suffered in a car crash in 2001 led to his retirement less then two years later.  He took over as manager in April 2003 following the departure of Jean Tigana.  Sanchez has led Northern Ireland to the top of their European Championships qualifying group with victories over Spain and Sweden.  He also oversaw a famous 1-0 win over England in the last World Cup qualifying competition, and has pledged to see out his contract with the Irish Football Association.  The 47-year-old's first match in charge of the Cottagers will be on Saturday when they face his former club Reading.
