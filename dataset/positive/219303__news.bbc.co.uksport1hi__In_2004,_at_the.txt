Pinsent replaced Jan Zelezny on the IOC's Athletes' Commission in 2001 while the three-time Olympic javelin champion concentrated on his training.  But the Czech athlete regained his place after an election in Athens.  The other successful candidates were Frankie Fredericks, Hicham El Guerrouj and Rania Elwani.  Pinsent will now relinquish his IOC role after the Athens Games.  The Olympic champion's failure to keep his place on the IOC will not affect London's chances of winning the 2012 Games, according to the bid team.  "This is in no way a blow to the bid," said Mike Lee, the communications director for London 2012.  "Matthew has been totally focused on his preparations for Athens and on winning his fourth gold medal.  "Because of this, he's not been able to actively campaign for re-election. This has obviously affected his vote."  Although IOC members are not allowed to vote for their own cities as hosts, they are able to lobby their colleagues.  The four elected athletes will serve as IOC members for the next eight years, taking to 19 the number of sportsmen and women on the commission.  Namibian sprinter Fredericks, who is retiring after these Games, is a four-time silver medallist, while El Guerrouj ended his long wait for a 1500m gold in Athens.  Ex-swimmer Elwani competed in three Olympics before taking up a number of high-profile political positions in domestic and international sports.
