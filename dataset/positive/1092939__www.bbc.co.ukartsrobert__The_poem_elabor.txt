The poem, 'Address to the Toothache' was first published in the Belfast Newsletter on 11 September 1797.  An example of Burns's skill when writing in Scots, Burns exploits the often harsh, plosive and alliterative qualities of the language together with grotesque imagery to demonise toothache, 'thou grim, mischief-making chiel,/That gars the notes o' discord squeal,' with comedic effect.
