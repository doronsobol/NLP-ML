A police officer has been killed and ten people injured after shots were fired from the Libyan People's Bureau in central London.  WPC Yvonne Fletcher had been helping control a small demonstration outside the embassy when automatic gunfire came from outside.  She received a fatal stomach wound and some of the demonstrators were also severely injured.  WPC Fletcher, 25, died soon afterwards at Westminster Hospital.  Her fianc√©, another police officer who was also at the demonstration, was at her side.  After the shooting people were cleared from surrounding offices in St James' Square.  Some had witnessed events from their workplace.  Film maker Ray Barker said people were stunned by what had happened.  "Several of my colleagues burst into tears. It was unbelievable that sort of thing could happen at such an insignificant demonstration," he said.  Journalist Brian Cartmell was in St James' Square just feet away from Yvonne Fletcher when she was hit.  "She crumpled to the floor clutching her lower stomach and groin and rolled on to her right-hand side with a look of total surprise on her pretty face," Mr Cartmell said.  The Libyan building is now surrounded by armed police officers including specialist marksmen.  However, Home Secretary Leon Brittan has said the police are prepared to wait and deal with the situation in a peaceful way.  Police officers are in touch with those inside the Libyan People's Bureau via a special telephone link.  The Libyans, led by Colonel Gaddafi, are blaming Britain's police and security forces for "attacking" their embassy.  Libyan soldiers have now surrounded Britain's embassy in Tripoli trapping 18 diplomats inside.
