A left-arm spin delivery turns from the leg side to the off when bowled at a right-handed batsmen.  The way the ball is bowled is exactly the same as a right-arm off spinner would deliver a normal off break.  But because it's bowled with the left hand, the ball is released in the opposite direction, meaning the ball will turn away from the bat.  The left-arm spinner provides a captain with yet another option to attack a batsmen.  Most left-arm spinners bowl around the wicket, aiming to drift the ball towards the bat before turning the ball away.  Step One    The middle joints of the index and middle fingers are well spread across the seam. The ball rests against the third finger but the thumb has little involvement.  Step Two    Turning the wrist and the index finger generate the spin on the ball, turning the ball in a clockwise direction.
