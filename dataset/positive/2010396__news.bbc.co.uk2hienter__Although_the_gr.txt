Spice Girls publicists have denied rumours that the group is splitting up following claims by Mel C that she "does not intend to do any more work" with the band.  It ain't over until it's over and it ain't over  Rumours of a split began circulating when the 27-year-old star told Reuters news agency: "I don't intend to do any more work with the Spice Girls.  "Really, I've not been comfortable being in the Spice Girls for probably the last two years.  "It doesn't really feel that natural to me any more.  "I've grown up and I just feel that I want to do things my own way and not compromise."  Mel C is widely considered to be the strongest vocalist in the group and from an early stage was said to be unhappy about her "Sporty Spice" image.  But the Spice Girls publicity machine has brushed aside her comments, insisting the band has a strong future.  Spice Girls spokesman Alan Edwards said: "Melanie C hasn't left the Spice Girls.  "Everyone wants to say it's over but it isn't, the group have still got strong ties.  "What she said is that we've got no plans at the moment and it's been exaggerated into the final split and it isn't the final split.  "As everyone knows, the Spice Girls are pursuing their own solo projects but the Spice Girls still exists.  "It ain't over until it's over and it ain't over."
