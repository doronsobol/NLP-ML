The house in Ewloe, Flintshire, is on sale for £595,000.  The 24-year-old player lived at the house for about four years and bought a whole row of houses down the road for his parents and other members of his family.  Owen, who has a baby daughter with his partner Louise, no longer needs the home where he stored his England football caps because he has moved into his £1.6m country manor house at Soughton Hall in Sychdyn, near Mold.  The property for sale has five bedrooms, two studies, a double garage, three bath or shower rooms and a top floor billiards and games room.  Owen, whose girlfriend is recovering in hospital after breaking her pelvis in a horse accident at their Soughton Hall home, was previously embroiled in a row with ramblers over the Ewloe house.  Ramblers claimed that a public footpath ran through his front room and they had the right of way.  However, the path has now been diverted and the property has four CCTV cameras, a gate entry system and burglar alarm, and the rear gardens are set behind a brick wall for privacy reasons.  One neighbour who did not wish to be identified said a number of people had been to see it.  "Most seemed interested in buying a beautiful house rather than who lived there before."  Coincidentally, his childhood home in Cromwell Close, Hawarden was put on the market in April last year.  That was advertised for £190,000 and the sale is said to be proceeding with the house "under offer".
