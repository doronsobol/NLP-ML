Melton Mowbray pork pies have been given Protected Geographical Status (PGI) by officials in Europe, following a 10-year fight.  The move means that only producers making pork pies using a traditional recipe and in the vicinity of Melton Mowbray can use the town's name.  As long as no other European member state objects before 4 October, the pork pies will be protected for good.  The registration was published in the European Union Journal on Friday.  Matthew O'Callaghan, chairman of the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (MMPPA), said: "The award of PGI for Melton Mowbray pork pies safeguards our regional food heritage, protects our local jobs and gives the consumer value for money.  "Fundamentally it stops people using the name and reputation of Melton Mowbray for commercial gain alone and ensures that the market is not devalued."  Leeds-based Northern Foods had fought the application to give pork pies an exclusive regional status, such as Champagne, but abandoned its challenge after it decided to relocate its factory to Nottingham, within the restricted zone.  Melton Mowbray pork pies are distinctive as they are made from uncured pork, to ensure the inside is grey in colour.  Other foods added to the list included Arbroath Smokies, Cornish Clotted Cream and Welsh Lamb.
