Lt Adamson said the incident was "pretty terrifying" A British army officer who, after running out of ammunition, used his bayonet to charge a Taliban fighter has been awarded the Military Cross. Lt James Adamson, who is 24 and serves with the Royal Regiment of Scotland, was given the medal for his "supreme physical courage". His actions while on tour in Afghanistan saved the lives of soldiers in his platoon. He said he ran out of ammunition after killing one man, so charged the second. Lt Adamson, who is from the Isle of Man, and part of the 5th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, said: "To be honest it was pretty terrifying. "I think more so after the event - as it was going on there was fractions of a second between the first guy and the second guy. The Military Cross is awarded in recognition of exemplary gallantry "By the time I realised the danger was there, it was already gone. "It was the kind of the two or three minutes after that, where myself and Corporal Hamilton were still on our own - just waiting for the reserve section to echelon through and pick us up - that we were pretty convinced that if there were two there, there could have been more. "So we were there waiting for the rest to turn up and I think that was probably the longest two minutes of my life." The citation for Lt Adamson's award - as detailed on the MoD website - reads: "Adamson' supreme physical courage, combined with the calm leadership he continued to display after a very close encounter with the Taliban, were of the very highest order. "His actions also neutralised an enemy flanking attack which could have resulted in casualties for his platoon."
