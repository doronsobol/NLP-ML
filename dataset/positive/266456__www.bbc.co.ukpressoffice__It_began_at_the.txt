      Richard Hannay (Rupert Penry-  Jones) goes on a roller-coaster   ride full of excitement, danger,   fun and romance in The 39   Steps Rupert Penry-Jones stars as Richard Hannay in Lizzie Mickery's (The State Within, Messiah) adaptation of John Buchan's classic novel, The 39 Steps. Directed by James Hawes (Merlin, Fanny Hill) and filmed on location in Scotland, The 39 Steps is set in the days running up to the outbreak of the First World War and follows the escapades of Richard Hannay in a roller-coaster action adventure full of excitement, danger, fun and romance, as he attempts to outwit a German spy ring and save the nation from invasion. Hannay's life changes for ever when British spy Scudder barges into his flat, with information about a German spy ring based in Scotland. Fearing for his life, he persuades a reluctant Hannay to take his coded notebook to Captain Kell of the Secret Service Bureau – stressing it is a matter of grave national security. Scudder is killed by German spies desperate for his notebook and Hannay finds himself wrongly accused of murder. Spurred on by this bizarre turn of events, Hannay flees London for Scotland – hoping to uncover the German espionage ring and to prove his innocence. As the police and spies both close in on him, he struggles to decode Scudder's secret notebook. Hannay is chased by bloodhounds, shot at by the spies and strafed by a bi-plane, and nearly rolls under the wheels of a car driven by Harry Sinclair and his sister, suffragette Victoria Sinclair. To Hannay's horror, in a series of comic misunderstandings, he finds himself on the run with Victoria. The last thing he needs is to be stuck with an opinionated female. However, the couple's mutual loathing turns to romance as they find themselves facing death together. As he and Victoria decipher Scudder's notebook, Hannay realises it isn't just their future that hangs in the balance but that of the entire nation. In a desperate race against time, he uses all his ingenuity and skill to unmask a traitor and keep the nation safe. Rupert Penry-Jones stars as Richard Hannay, Alex Jennings as Captain Kell, Eddie Marsan as Scudder, Patrick Kennedy as Harry Sinclair and Lydia Leonard as Victoria Sinclair. The 39 Steps also stars David Haig as Sir George Sinclair, Patrick Malahide as Professor Fisher, Stephen Elder as the Vicar, Werner Daehn as Ackerman and Peter Stark as Engel.    His Royal Highness The Prince Of Wales drops by Dumfries House, near Cumnock in East Ayrshire, for this special edition of Antiques Roadshow, presented by Fiona Bruce. The Prince talks about his role in a remarkable £45m rescue plan that he recently spearheaded to save the house and its important collection of furniture, much of it made by Thomas Chippendale, and purchased when the house was constructed in 1754. As the Prince reveals to Fiona, it was only a last-minute intervention that returned the pieces to the house after they had been dispatched from Scotland for a sale in London. The Prince explains: "The most important thing, of course, was the fact that it was an intact and unique collection, which is very rare – to have a house that still has all its original furniture and everything made for the house, in this case by Chippendale and those three great Edinburgh furniture makers, Mathie, Brodie and Peter." The Prince's interview forms a central portion of the programme, which also features some remarkable valuation stories as many hundreds of Ayrshire residents arrive to see the experts at work in the grounds of Dumfries House. Amongst the objects under scrutiny is a glass vase, originally bought for a pound at a boot sale, which turns out to be the rarest and most valuable piece of glass ever seen on the show. It was discovered by Roadshow veteran Eric Knowles, who says: "I've been waiting over 25 years for such a piece to come in to a Roadshow, and this was the stuff of dreams – they'd dumped it in the attic after the plant in it died and were about to throw it away when the show rolled in to town." The piece has since gone on to sell at auction at an even higher price than Eric's evaluation figure.

Around The World In 20 Years       Michael Palin celebrates the 20th anniversary of his TV classic, Around The World In 80 Days, in this one-hour special. One of the most memorable segments of Michael's famous circumnavigation was the open dhow voyage from Dubai to Bombay. As he said goodbye to the crew and their trusted boat, the Al Shama (meaning candlelight), Michael made a forecast. "At this point", he said, "it is impossible to accept that I shall never see them again". Michael goes in search of that very same dhow and its captain and crew. He begins in Dubai, which has now transformed from a dusty trading port to a mini-Manhattan, and reacquaints himself with the city. He then meets two officials who helped organise the original voyage – they don't know what has happened to Captain Hassan Sulyman, however, and there have been no sightings of the dhow in Dubai in 20 years, but Michael has more leads to follow up. His search moves to Bombay. Fortunately, the broking firm which handled Al Shama's cargo all those years ago is still in existence. Its new owner, Digant Joshi, agrees to ask around. This gives Michael an opportunity to take a second look at the city in which he arrived first time round as a rather unshaven and exhausted traveller. He takes his laundry to the open-air dhobi-ghats, wonders anew at the daily miracle of the tiffin-wallahs and has a brief encounter with a Bollywood mogul. Eventually, Joshi has some answers. The good news is that the captain and some of the crew are living in a village called Mandvi in Gujerat Province, northwest India. The bad news is that Al Shama sank just five months before Michael's arrival. He hastens north by rail and is delighted to discover that Mandvi is a completely unspoiled town given over entirely to the construction of wooden dhows. After his long search, Michael walks up to a house lying in the shadow of a dhow under construction. It is the moment of truth, as his bleak prediction all those years ago is put to the final test.
