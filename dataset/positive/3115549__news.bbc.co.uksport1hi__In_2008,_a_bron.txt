The Â£25,000 bronze ox, which has been funded by three companies who back the Blue Square Premier club, stands guard at the west end of the stadium.  Brendan Cross of STL, one of the firms involved, said: "If the unveiling marks the start of a successful period for the club, then so much the better."  Oxford board members Nick Merry and Jim Smith were there for the ceremony.
