As a result of the crowd's reaction she did not finish her trip in a car around the Battle arena.  Organisers said they had spoken to her and she would still appear in the Moonlight Parade on Friday night.  The Battle Association decided to spend more than £20,000 for the services of X Factor runner-up Andy Abraham and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Marsh.  Some of the money is from the £50,000 extra the Economic Development Department gave the Battle this year, and some is from sponsorship from local firms.  Senator Phillip Ozouf, Minister for Economic Development said the money was well spent.  He said: "It was a very small minority of people that were involved.  "Jersey is know for the warmth of its welcome and I am sure the incidents will not be repeated this evening."  Marsh will be visiting the island women's refuge on Friday.  The cost of bringing the celebrities to the island has caused controversy.  Some callers to a BBC Radio Jersey phone-in suggested the money should be given to float builders or Miss Battle instead.  Others liked the idea of a celebrity coming over but thought that for that much money it should be a well-known, international celebrity.
