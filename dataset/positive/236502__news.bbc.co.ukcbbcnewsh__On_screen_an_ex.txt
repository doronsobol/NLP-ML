The move is part of attempts to update the programme after 25 years, with telly bosses hoping to bring in the man who invented Grange Hill to think up the changes.    Tucker was one of the most famous characters Phil Redmond also created Brookside and Hollyoaks, and Grange Hill could be filmed at the same studios where the two soaps are made, Mersey Studios. CBBC Bosses said of the drama: "It's had a fantastic 25 years and this is one way to ensure a great programme has an exciting future." When Grange Hill began it was unusual because lots of the characters had very strong London accents, now that is much more normal on TV, and the new-look series may have pupils from all over the country.
