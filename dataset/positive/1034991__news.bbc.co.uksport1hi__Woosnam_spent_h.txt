"Woosie", 48, is a golfer from another era, when fun was more important than fitness, but underneath the amiable exterior smoulders a fierce competitor.  He won the Masters in 1991 and was world number one for 51 weeks.  Woosnam played in eight Ryder Cups (1983-1997) and won four, including the historic 1985 victory at The Belfry.  Until then America had not lost the transatlantic tussle since 1957.  Woosnam was vice-captain to Sam Torrance when Europe won back the Ryder Cup at The Belfry in 2002.  He has chosen Ireland's two-time Cup veteran Des Smyth (1979-81) and old pal Peter Baker (1993) as his vice-captains this time around.  Woosnam has also finished second in the Open in 1989 and third twice, in 1986 and 2001.  Going into the final round of the 2001 Open at Royal Lytham, Woosnam was in a four-way share of the lead but was penalised two shots for carrying 15 clubs in his bag - one more than is allowed.  Two months later, Woosnam's matchplay tenacity shone through again when he became the first player to win the World Match Play title in three decades (1987, 1990, 2001) - and, at 43, the oldest winner.
