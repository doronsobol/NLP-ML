The 36-year-old has been in impressive form since joining Rangers from Everton on a six-month deal in January.  Weir admitted that the lure of another year with the Ibrox club - with Champions League football a possibility - was too good to turn down.  "I didn't look at any other options because any option other than Rangers would have been second best," he said.  Rangers are unbeaten in the SPL since Weir arrived, winning seven and drawing two of the games he has featured in.  The 54-times-capped Weir says that despite the fact his family still live in England, he didn't need much persuasion to stay in Glasgow until  "When I got the opportunity to stay here for another year I didn't need much persuading," he added.  "My family are fine, and it's not a problem."
