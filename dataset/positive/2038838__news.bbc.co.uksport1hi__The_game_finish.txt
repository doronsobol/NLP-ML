Birmingham referee Andy Hall has included both in his match report, along with one incident when a supporter ran onto the pitch to remonstrate with him.  Hall showed yellow cards to Clarke Carlisle and Stephen Kelly for encroachment, later dismissing both for two bookable offences in a match Rangers had to win to pip Crewe to automatic promotion from Nationwide Division Two.  But chief executive David Davies fears a fine, a points deduction or even QPR being forced to play a match behind closed doors because of persistent bad behaviour on the terraces.  He told the official club website, www.qpr.co.uk: "After strenuous efforts and requests for supporters not to go on the pitch it was upsetting that so many disregarded our pleas.  "The actions of a minority could land us in really hot water.  "We received a copy of the referee's report and It makes grim reading.  "In it he makes clear reference to a nasty coin throwing incident, a supporter entering the field of play to remonstrate with him and the pitch invasion after the final whistle.  "Bearing in mind that the FA have taken a dim view of previous incidents and have already written to us to ask for our comments after the pitch invasion at the Brentford game, Saturday's events could have very serious implications.  "It is not far-fetched to suggest that should this kind of behaviour recur, the FA are quite within their rights to impose the ultimate sanctions of forcing us to play a game at Loftus Road behind locked doors or even docking league points."
