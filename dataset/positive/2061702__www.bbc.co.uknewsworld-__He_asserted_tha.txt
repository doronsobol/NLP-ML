He asserted that since the politicians had not asked the people by a referendum to abolish the institution, a referendum to bring him back was not needed.

Nepal's deposed king, Gyanendra, has said for the first time that he wants to return to the throne.  Speaking to the News 24 television channel, he said that he had made an agreement six years ago with his country's political parties that he would be a constitutional monarch.  But the government abolished the monarchy in 2008.  The former king said he did not want to be active in Nepal's politics, but did want a largely ceremonial role.  His move comes at a time of political turmoil in Nepal.  A constituent assembly was recently dissolved after failing to reach agreement on a new constitution.  Fresh elections are planned for November, but in the meantime Nepal is in a political vacuum.  The BBC's John Narayan Parajuli in Kathmandu say that many ordinary Nepalis are also frustrated with the failure of their politicians to make progress on key issues like unemployment.  He says it is unclear how many would see the return of the king, even in a ceremonial role, as a welcome development.  In a rare interview, the former monarch, now known as Gyanendra Shah, told News 24 that he had been forced to make an agreement with opposition parties in 2006 after weeks of anti-government protests.  "This included the reinstatement of the dissolved parliament, the appointment of a prime minister from among the parties, and restoration of constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy," he said.  He said that the parties would have to answer for their behaviour.
