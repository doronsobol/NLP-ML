Ahead of Tuesday's trip to Watford, and in the wake of the loss to Plymouth, Holloway has reminded his side not to rely on Howard's aerial strength.  "When you've got someone like Steve in your team you've got to use him properly," he told BBC Radio Leicester.  "We played far too many balls off Steve's head."  Holloway joked: "I put a target on his head in training this morning.  "He's a target man but the target should be his chest or his feet not always his head - that's an additional thing."
