The 21-year-old was signed by former manager Brian Carey and played in his last three matches.  However since Brian Little took over from Carey, Collins has not featured and has been allowed to return to the Liberty Stadium.  He joined the Swans in the summer from Fulham but is yet to make a first team appearance for Roberto Martinez' team.
