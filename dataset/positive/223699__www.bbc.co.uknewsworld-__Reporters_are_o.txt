The restoration of democratic rule in 2014 has led to "a decline in censorship of content and political interference with outlets", according to a 2015 report by Washington-based advocacy group Freedom House.  Following a coup in 2009, the Rajoelina government closed several outlets and radio stations were the target of physical attacks.  Censorship, harassment and intimidation were also reported.  Although nationwide broadcasting remains a state monopoly, there are hundreds of private local radio and TV stations. Radio is the main medium for news.  There were 1.1 million internet users by November 2015 (Internetworldstats.com).
