Coldplay have shot straight to the top of the UK albums chart - despite their record having been on sale for just three days. The band's fourth album, Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends, has sold 302,000 copies since Thursday. It has become one of the fastest-selling records in history. Meanwhile, dance act Mint Royale remains at the top of the singles chart with Singin' In The Rain, which was featured on ITV's Britain's Got Talent. R&B singer Rihanna stayed at number two with Take A Bow, followed by Ne-Yo with Closer. 1. Coldplay - Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends 5. The Fratellis- Here We Stand The highest-placed new entry in the singles chart was Feeder's We Are The People, which charted at number 25. The new release from Coldplay - whose last album, X&Y, has sold 10 million copies since 2005 - had been hotly-anticipated. In May, the band's website collapsed after Violet Hill - the first single from the album - was made available for seven days as a free download on the band's website. Gennaro Castaldo, of music retailer HMV, said: "Coldplay have sold as many albums in three days as most big artists sell in three months. "They have the broadest appeal of any band around in terms of combined record store, online and download sales, and are already certs to have the biggest release of 2008." Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends pushed last week's number one, Paul Weller's 22 Dreams, into fourth place, behind veteran Neil Diamond's Home Before Dark and Duffy's Rockferry. Other new entries included indie-rockers The Fratellis, who charted at number five with Here We Stand, and hip-hop production trio NERD whose Seeing Sounds album entered at number 20.
