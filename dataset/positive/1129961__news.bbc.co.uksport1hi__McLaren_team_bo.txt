McLaren's Juan Montoya was third behind Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso's Renault on Sunday.  But Whitmarsh said: "I believe we'll beat Ferrari over the course of the year, even at current levels.  "We need to lift our performance level to beat Renault. We have to accept that Renault is the benchmark."  Renault boss Flavio Briatore agreed with McLaren, suggesting that the Ferrari resurgence would not lead to a concerted push for the title.  "For us this result is very good," he said. "We knew this circuit was not best for us and we still finished second. Better than that, we took more points from [Kimi] Raikkonen.  After four races defending champion Alonso leads the standings with 36 points, with Schumacher on 21, Raikkonen on 18 and Montoya on 15.  McLaren team chief Ron Dennis, meanwhile, blamed Kimi Raikkonen's poor performance for the team's failure to finish in the top two on Sunday.  Raikkonen qualified eighth, one place behind Montoya, and ended the race in fifth position.  "It would have put him on the second row of the grid and I think it would have been a very different race.  "We should have qualified harder and we could have raced harder."
