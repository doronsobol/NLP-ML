The three candidates are Sir Reg Empey, Alan McFarland and David McNarry. The deadline for nominations passed at 1700 BST on Friday.  Mr Trimble resigned as leader after the party lost all but one of its MPs in the May general election. He was one of the UUP's high profile casualties.  The Ulster Unionist Council will meet on 24 June to elect his successor.  Mr McNarry was the first man to throw his hat in the ring for the leadership contest, saying that he wanted change and to "take the party out of denial".  At the news conference where Sir Reg announced his intention to stand, it emerged he had the backing of more than half the party's MLAs as well as its MEP, Jim Nicholson.  The East Belfast assembly member and former Stormont enterprise minister said the UUP was guilty of not listening to its supporters and vowed to change that if he became leader.  Former British army major Alan McFarland, who has the backing of the party's sole MP Sylvia Hermon, said he was leading a "grass-roots rebellion".  The North Down MLA said his military background would help him unite the party and instil necessary discipline.  The candidates now have a week to convince about 700 Ulster Unionist Council delegates of their leadership credentials.
