In the same month as his signing, Celtic announced that Viduka had quit the club without kicking a ball for them, citing stress as his reason.

Viduka enjoyed a successful spell at Parkhead, despite a rocky start which saw him walk out four days after signing due to stress.  He had the chance to return to Celtic but signed a three-year deal with Boro, and the ex-Leeds star said: "I wanted to stay in the Premiership.  "There was some interest from Celtic but I'm not for going back in life."  Viduka overcame his early problems at Celtic to prove himself in front of goal, earning a move to Leeds, despite O'Neill's pleas for him to remain at Parkhead.  The Australian was part of a double strike-swoop by Boro boss Steve McClaren, and could form a formidable partnership with Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink.
