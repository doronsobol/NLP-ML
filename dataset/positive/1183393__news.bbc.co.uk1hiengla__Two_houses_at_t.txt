Thames Water said about 200 homes in Thames Ditton, Surrey were flooded when the main in Basingfield Road burst in the early hours on Thursday.  Fire crews at the scene said some homes were 3ft (0.9m) deep in water.  Thames Water said a 48in (1.2m) main serving part of Surrey and a wide area of south-west London had burst.  Loss adjusters were visiting affected householders and letters were being delivered explaining how to claim for damages.  The company said staff would remain on site until late on Thursday to answer questions.  The leak also affected Embercourt Road, the High Street and Station Road.  No evacuations of houses were necessary but one resident, where the burst happened, was now staying with a neighbour.  A statement issued by the company apologised for the inconvenience to customers, adding: "Unfortunately, a number of properties had been flooded before we were able to control the flow of water."  Fire crews were still at the scene at 1000 GMT pumping out houses.  Station Manager Dave Keelan said: "At its peak, we were faced with a number of properties that could have been affected by the flooding.  "However, once the water main had been isolated, there was a significant drop in the water level to about half a metre."  Elmbridge Borough Council said elderly people had to be moved from the Ember day centre because of the disruption.  Ten schools closed for the day and were expected to open on Friday. Information on school closures is being put on the Surrey Alert website.  An estimated 17,000 properties experienced loss of supply or low water pressure.  A West Molesey resident, James Mould, said water supplies had been reduced to a trickle across Thames Ditton, East Molesey and West Molesey.
