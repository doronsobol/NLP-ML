A Scottish marine services firm has secured a contract to operate one of the busiest ferries across the Thames.  Briggs Marine has won the right to take over the Woolwich Ferry from current operator Serco, starting next April.  Briggs, based at Burntisland in Fife, is expanding into public passenger services.  The contract is worth about £50m over seven years. It is let by Transport for London, with Briggs taking over running of the existing assets.  The Woolwich Ferry currently has three vessels, carrying about 20,000 vehicles and 50,000 passengers each week.  Briggs already employs 500 people with a recent annual turnover of about £40m, operating contract marine services, but this is the first long-term public ferry contract it has won, which is part of what the Fife firms says has been a long-term plan.  Collieson Briggs, managing director, said the contract was "testament to the specialist skills and expertise that we possess and continue to develop".  He added: "We are looking forward to working closely with London River Services and the Woolwich Ferry's existing team both to deliver a seamless transition and also to continue to improve on the safety, reliability and efficiency of this vital transport link."
