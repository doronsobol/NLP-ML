Music from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey was played at the funeral and members of the family which had adopted him cried as his coffin was lowered.  "Here lies Arthur C Clarke. He never grew up and did not stop growing," his gravestone in Colombo is to read, in accordance with the author's wishes.  Sir Arthur died from heart failure and breathing problems at the age of 90.  A nationwide minute's silence was ordered by the Sri Lankan government to coincide with the ceremony.  Sir Arthur's brother, Fred Clarke, attended the funeral along with members of the Ekanayake family, with whom the writer had lived in recent years.  Post-polio syndrome meant Sir Arthur had used a wheelchair since 1995.  Fred Clarke said his elder brother had "always loved" the "warm climate and the friendly people" of Sri Lanka.  "He said he had managed to escape 40 British winters and had no regrets," Mr Clarke told AFP news agency.  Tamara Ekanayake, who grew up at Sir Arthur's home in Colombo, paid tribute to him at the service, saying: "We feel so privileged that you left your mark on us."  "Your footprint will never fade. If anything, it will only magnify what we do," she told mourners.  Before the funeral, yellow roses were thrown on to Sir Arthur's body as a final gesture of respect as it lay on a white bed beneath curved elephant tusks.
