He died in Paris on Tuesday after a long illness.  His body was flown to the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, where a prayer service took place in the central mosque.  Mr Ould Daddah was president from 1961, when Mauritania won its independence from France, until he was overthrown in a bloodless coup 17 years later.  From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
