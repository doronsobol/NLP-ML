Work on a major new link road in South Yorkshire is to start within weeks after the scheme was given final approval by the government.  The Â£56m Finningley and Rossington Regeneration Route Scheme will link the M18 to the south of Doncaster with Robin Hood Airport.  Doncaster Mayor Ros Jones said the route would be a "catalyst for economic growth", leading to new jobs and homes.  The two-year project on the dual carriageway will start in October.  Doncaster Council said the scheme would help to regenerate the village of Rossington, cut journey times, ease congestion, support further growth at the airport and provide the necessary road infrastructure for major projects including the redevelopment of the former Rossington Colliery site.
