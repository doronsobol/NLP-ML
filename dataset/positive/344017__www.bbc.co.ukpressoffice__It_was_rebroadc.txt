Two of the best known figures in the entertainment world - Bette Midler and David Geffen - are to feature in a BBC Radio 2 documentary about the singer and songwriter Laura Nyro.  Hollywood superstar Bette Midler, who was a friend of Laura's, is to present the documentary Shooting Star - Laura Nyro Remembered (Radio 2, Saturday 9 April, 9.30-10.30pm).  The programme includes an interview with entertainment mogul David Geffen who was Laura's manager in the late Sixties and guided her career.  Laura, who died in 1997 aged 49, was a singer-songwriter contemporary of Joni Mitchell and Carole King.  She is regarded as one of the great lost talents of popular music, and is best known for songs like Stoney End and Stoned Soul Picnic, which were hit records for artists including Barbra Streisand, The Fifth Dimension, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Three Dog Night.  Speaking about the documentary, Bette says: "I knew Laura and counted her as a friend, so it's a great pleasure to share her music and the story of her life with Radio 2 listeners."  In his interview for the programme, David Geffen says: "From 1966 to 1970, Laura Nyro had a real burst of creative genius... like a shooting star.
