In the last decade more than 30 pieces have been erected and a publication detailing the story of the sculptures has been launched by the Forest of Belfast and Belfast City Council.  The scheme has been operating in the city for more than 12 years.  The Carving a Future for Belfast booklet was launched at the unveiling of the city's latest piece of public sculpture, The Bowler by Owen Crawford, at the bowling pavilion in the Falls Park on Tuesday.  The sculptures cover all types of material - from reclaimed timber to stone and metal.  Ben Simon, from the Forest of Belfast, said the sculptures helped reinforce connections with nature.  "We have many talented sculptors and it's wonderful to see how they can create work that can add so much to our open spaces," he said.  "The works we have commissioned over the past 12 years - sculptures of people, plants and animals, including a bronze hedgehog, a timber owl on a tree stump, and a flight of geese by the lake at Victoria Park - remind us of the connection we have with nature and our surroundings."  The new publication is available free from Belfast City Council's Parks Department, and includes a map showing where all the sculptures can be found in the city.
