A Â£1bn programme to "transform" Manchester Airport has been announced.  The 10-year plan will include the expansion of Terminal 2, self-service check-in facilities and a larger security hall.  Facilities are planned to allow passengers to go through the United States' immigration process before they board transatlantic flights.  Manchester Airports Group (MAG) said the investment will mean it "continues to thrive as a national asset".  The work will also include improvements to Terminal 3 as well as create new food and retail outlets.  Charlie Cornish, chief executive of MAG, said: "We're setting out how the airport will contribute to the development of a 'northern powerhouse' and demonstrating the dynamic, 'can-do' spirit that sums up the region.  "The transformation programme will ensure the airport plays its full part in driving economic growth and develops as a key part of the UK transport infrastructure."  These days it's easy enough to badge any economic development as being part of the Northern Powerhouse - that strategy to strengthen the economy in the North of England.  But those behind these plans for Manchester Airport's development say they are a crucial piece of the jigsaw.  Manchester is not going to rival Heathrow or Gatwick. But better road and rail links could attract more passengers wanting to fly out of Manchester Airport, and indeed those travelling to the UK.  Manchester City Council owns a third of Manchester Airports Group, which has four airports in its portfolio.  With a billion pounds of investment, the airport could potentially become a global asset for the North of England.
