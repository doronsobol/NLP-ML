Seven inmates at Folsom prison in California have been taken to hospital after guards opened fire during a riot, authorities say.  None of the prisoners' injuries are believed to be life-threatening, prison spokesman Luis Patino said.  The riot, involving about 200 inmates, broke out on Friday night. No guards were injured, reports said.  Three of the wounded inmates were reportedly taken to local hospitals, while others were treated at the jail.  Initial reports said that five inmates had been wounded by guards when they opened fire.  The number of casualties was later increased, but Mr Patino said it was unclear if all the wounded had been shot by the guards, or injured by other inmates.  The medium-security prison, which holds about 4,000 prisoners, has now been brought under control and the cause of the riot is being investigated, Mr Patino said.  Folsom State Prison, about 20 miles (32km) from the state capital Sacramento, was made famous by the US singer-songwriter Johnny Cash in his 1955 song Folsom Prison Blues.  Cash also performed a concert for inmates in the prison's refectory in 1968.
