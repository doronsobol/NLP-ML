Dylan released his first album in 1962 Bob Dylan has topped the UK album chart for the seventh time in his career, nearly 40 years since his last number one LP. Together Through Life is the folk music legend's 33rd studio album, according to the Official Charts Company. He last topped the UK chart with New Morning in 1970. His first, in 1964, was The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Dylan now holds a record, previously held by Tom Jones, for the longest gap between solo number one albums.

Together Through Life was recorded late last year and is Dylan's first studio album since 2006 and is his 53rd album, including compilations and soundtracks. 2. Music For The People - The Enemy 5.
