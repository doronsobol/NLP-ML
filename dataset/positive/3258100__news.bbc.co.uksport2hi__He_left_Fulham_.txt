Radzinski, 33, and midfielder Claus Jensen, 30, who revealed he was leaving on Friday, rejected the chance to extend their deals earlier this season.  Goalkeeper Mark Crossley and Welsh midfielder Mark Pembridge have also been released by the new boss.  On-loan trio Wayne Routledge, Jan Lastuvka and Vincenzo Montella have all returned to their parent clubs.  Canada international Radzinski joined the Cottagers from Everton in 2004 and made over 100 appearances.  He was signed as a forward but has also played in midfield during his time with the club.  Radzinski scored three goals this season, with Premiership strikes against Arsenal and West Ham and another in the 3-0 FA Cup win over Stoke.  Jensen criticised the club last week after claiming he had no future under Sanchez's "long-ball" tactics and becomes a free agent.  Crossley, 37, spent part of the season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and has been told he will not be offered a new deal.
