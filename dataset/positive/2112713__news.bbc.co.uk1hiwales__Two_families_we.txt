Eight people were rescued after the breach on the Brecon and Monmouthshire canal at Gilwern last Tuesday.  The A4077 between Crickhowell and Gilwern is expected to reopen later this week.  Twenty-three hire boats were also affected, so cranes will be brought in to help right them.  A British Waterways spokeswoman said: "Work will continue over the weekend and the road is expected to reopen towards the end of next week."  In parallel, planning of the canal repairs has started.  "We wish to reassure the general public that a safe network is our main priority," she said.  "Our inspections are an important part of maintaining our 200-year-old waterways system."  A group of homes were evacuated in Gilwern, near Abergavenny, after the alarm was raised last Tuesday at 0730 BST.  Three were so badly damaged that two families were evacuated to Gilwern community centre.  One eyewitness described the breach as a "terrible scene," with water running down the hill onto a main road.  Firefighters and British Waterways worked to secure the waterway, and all roads in the area were closed.
