Nick Griffin has been re-elected as leader of the British National Party, according to the party's website.  It said he received 1,157 votes and his opponent, Andrew Brons MEP, received 1,148. Eleven papers were spoiled.  The website quoted Mr Griffin as saying the "time for division and disruption is over" and urging members of his party to "go forward together".  In May, the BNP, which has been hit by divisions, lost many of the seats it held on local councils in England.
