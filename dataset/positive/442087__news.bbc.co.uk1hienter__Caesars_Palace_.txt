This comes after the Observer reported a senior official at the casino's parent company saying Rene Angelil gambled up to $1m (£508,000) a week.  The casino later said his losses in 2005 and 2006 were a quarter of that figure, and were offset by other wins.  Caesars' president also apologised for "any embarrassment caused".  The UK's Observer newspaper had quoted Jan Jones, of Harrah's Entertainment, who later retracted her statement and said she did not know how much Angelil gambled.  She also apologised for referring to him by name.  Caesars Palace subsequently revealed that Angelil's casino losses in 2005 and 2006 had totalled $230,300 (£117,000), but that they were offset by tournament poker winnings of $259,079 (£132,000).  The figures had been released with Angelil's permission, the casino said.  Gary Selesner, president of Caesars Palace, said in a statement: "In life and in business, Rene is a winner, and one of the finest people I have ever known.  "Caesars Palace is very sorry for any embarrassment that may have resulted from the media speculation."  Celine Dion's five-year performing engagement at Caesars is to end in December, but the casino has not yet announced who will replace her.
