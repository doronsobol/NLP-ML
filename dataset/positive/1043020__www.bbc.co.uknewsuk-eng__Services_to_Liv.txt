Ferry sailings between Liverpool and Wirral have been cancelled for two days because cruise liner terminal facilities are unavailable.  The River Mersey ferries have been using the cruise liner berths while their own new one is being built.  With two cruise liners in the area, ferries will not sail between Liverpool and Wirral on 26 and 27 August.  Cross river travellers will need to use Merseyrail services between Hamilton Square and James Street.  However, travellers will still be able to board on the Wirral side at Seacombe and travel to Woodside in Birkenhead.  A new Â£7m Mersey Ferries landing stage is being built after the last one sank in severe weather in March 2006.  The new stage is scheduled to open in late autumn.  Mersey Ferries are currently working out of the Liverpool Cruise Liner facility at Princes Parade, a short walk from the Pier Head Ferry Terminal.
