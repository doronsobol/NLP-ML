In July 2013, the pub replaced their sign with a portrait of him painted by local artist Jack Melville, in honour of his long-term support of the south-east Essex music scene.

Terminally-ill musician Wilko Johnson's local pub has honoured him by changing its sign to feature his portrait.  Former Dr Feelgood guitarist Johnson, 65, is a regular at The Railway Hotel in Southend, Essex.  In January he announced he had pancreatic cancer and had been given nine or 10 months to live but had refused chemotherapy.  Johnson, whose farewell tour in February and March sold out, said he was delighted at the honour.  "Over the last year I have become a bit of a regular and, believe me, it's a good place to be," he added.  "I love The Railway Hotel and this thing they've done - putting my mush up outside - well, what can I say?  The new sign has been painted by artist Jack Melville, 55, another regular at the pub in Clifftown Road.  Dave Dulake, landlord of The Railway Hotel, said: "Everybody seems chuffed to bits.  "Wilko seems to sum up the spirit of this place.  "The way that he's taken the news of his illness and just carried on playing and jamming with people, and keeping spirits up, seems to give a bit of inspiration."  Johnson, real name John Wilkinson, was born on Canvey Island, Essex.  He became well known for his choppy playing style and his jerky, frantic stage persona and was a major influence on punk rock.  After leaving Dr Feelgood in 1977, he joined Ian Dury's Blockheads and formed his own group, The Wilko Johnson Band.  He has also acted in fantasy series Game of Thrones, playing an executioner.
