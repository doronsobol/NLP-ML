The new moderator is Rev Ron Johnstone, who had been deputy moderator.  It was announced last September that Mr Paisley would not be seeking re-election to the post.  At the time, the DUP leader said he had agreed to stand down as the church was facing a "very real crisis". He said he would continue his work as a clergyman.  Concerns had been expressed about Mr Paisley's dual role as first minister and moderator after the DUP and Sinn Fein agreed to share power last May.  When asked if it had been painful to relinquish his post as moderator, Mr Paisley replied: "Do I look like I'm in pain?"  A number of other church offices were also filled on Friday night.  Mr Paisley had been elected moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church every year, except one, since he founded the church in 1951.  Rev Johnstone said there had been no challenge to his election.  "It was a united meeting, decisions were unanimous," he said.
