The honour was voted for by fellow Premier League and Football League bosses and comes after he guided the club to eighth spot in the Premiership.  He picked up the award last year as the Royals were promoted to the top flight.  Sunderland's Roy Keane won the award for the Championship, Yeovil's Russell Slade triumphed in League One and Danny Wilson of Hartlepool for League Two.  Coppell's Reading finished only one place adrift of Uefa Cup qualification.  The 51-year-old's achievement follows the decision to commit himself to the club until 2009 after signing a new deal earlier in the season.  Former Manchester United midfielder Keane, meanwhile, led the Black Cats from an early-season relegation position to the Championship title.  Slade has taken Yeovil to the League One play-offs, while Hartlepool clinched promotion from League Two under Wilson.
