In their day they were the more refined means of transport up the cliff at Saltburn; today they're a quaint and nostalgic reminder of our seaside heritage.  The cliff lift at Saltburn has been in place in its present form since 1884, after the previous lift, built in 1873, was condemned.  Give or take a few modernisations here and there to ensure the safety of the public, the lift has remained a living time capsule for thousands of visitors to the resort, and is an important part of the town's past.  Powered by water, this simple, yet highly effective system has remained in place for many years.  Alan Ismey is the man responsible for looking after the lift, and here he explains the history and working of the lift in detail.
