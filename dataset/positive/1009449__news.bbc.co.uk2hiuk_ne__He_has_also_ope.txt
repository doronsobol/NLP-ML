Mike Chiplin, who was one of the group's founder members, has left "to pursue other musical opportunities".  The band, who are from Pontypridd, south Wales, are currently working on their third album, which is due for release next year.  It will follow their debut album thefakesoundofprogress and the 2004 release Start Something.  Speaking in a web log, the band said the split was "friendly and cool" because the six members were "friends before band mates".  An official statement read: "Lostprophets regret to announce the departure of drummer and founding member Mike Chiplin from the band.  "As the lads have all grown up together, the departure is an amicable one with Mike leaving to pursue other musical opportunities.  "The group are currently writing the follow up to their 'Start Something' LP and plan to begin recording their new album shortly which will be released early 2006."  A spokesman for the group said they were concentrating on the new music.  "They have been writing a lot of new material to see if they want to go in a new direction - they are very excited about it," he said.  Lostprophets have enjoyed success on both sides of the Atlantic since they were formed in 1997.  They are now managed by the same company who look after Metallica in the US and have supported bands including Linkin Park and Run DMC.  The single Last Train Home, taken from Start Something, reached number eight in the UK charts in early 2004.  One of the band, Jamie Oliver, has also showed off his art skills, with his work recently exhibited in a show about life in the south Wales valleys.
