The defender, 24, joined the Gills on a three-month loan last week after he was transfer-listed at Milton Keynes.  "It's quite local for me here, as I've been travelling quite far to Milton Keynes," he told the Gills' website.  "It was perfect when it was Wimbledon, but it was harder for me once we went up there. It's an opportunity to play in the league above, so I'm grateful."  The former Arsenal trainee joined Wimbledon in March 2003, and they moved to Milton Keynes later that year before changing their name in the summer of 2004.
