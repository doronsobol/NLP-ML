Eventually, on 17 March 2014 it was determined on grounds of aviation safety, that the old terminal building would have to be demolished.

Plans to demolish the listed 1930s Jersey Airport arrivals building have been approved by the planning minister.  Deputy Robert Duhamel had asked airport management to come up with alternatives to demolishing it, including moving the runway north.  He said it was a difficult decision, but gave approval based on advice from the airport authorities.  Airport director Doug Bannister said the building was too close to the runway and a risk to flight safety.  He said: "This decision now allows us to move forward and define our future development programme, which will see the construction of a new arrivals facility at Jersey Airport."  Deputy Duhamel said under normal circumstances he would not give approval for the demolition of a listed building with "significant historical and architectural significance".  He said: "The option of moving the runway was explored and subsequently discounted when a model of the airport clearly showed what the projected impact would be on other buildings and the neighbourhood around the airport."  Heritage campaigner Christopher Schofield said he was not surprised by the move.  He said: "When you have a debate like this, when somebody lays down a health and safety card, it would take a brave minister to say 'no, I'm not going to do it'."  The minister put a number of conditions on the demolition. These include plans for a full survey of the building to preserve a record of the structure.  Peter Le Gresley, operations director at the Environment Department, said: "If any hidden historic features are found, work will be suspended until the minister reviews them."
