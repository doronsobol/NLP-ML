Some of these were poorly performing Somerfield stores and some were former Kwik Save sites that had not proved successful after being converted to Somerfield stores in 2006.

Somerfield, which is operating out of the former KwikSave store, will pull out of the town in October.  The announcement follows the closure of the Co-op store in September 2005 which saw 23 people losing their jobs.  Somerfield has said it is closing after assessing store profitability in the town.  Last year, Somerfield took over the Penamser Road KwikSave store, which had been in the town for 30 years.  But following a review of its profits, managers have announced it will close its doors for good in October.  Until recently, the town was served by two supermarkets - Co-op and KwikSave (which became Somerfield).  But a new Tesco store opened followed by a Lidl shop and retailers faced tougher competition which eventually led to the closure of the Co-op and now the decision to shut Somerfield.  Julie Daniels of Somerfield said: "Colleagues at the store have been informed of the closure.  "All 21 colleagues will be provided with support in finding a position in another Somerfield store, or with another local employer.  "The decision to close the store was taken following an extensive business review to assess store profitability."  Manager Paul Hassall, of Penrhyndeudraeth, who has worked at the sore for the past 13 years said: "It all came as a shock to be told that we are being made redundant, and naturally staff are upset."
