The Celtic Crusaders, who will play their home games at Bridgend's Brewery Field, have had their application to join League Two accepted by the RFL.  Said Crusaders chief executive Chris O'Callaghan: "We're elated. Our aim is to reach Super League and we realise that the hard work has just started.  "We shall also be representing South Wales and we take that seriously."  The Crusaders, who will become the 34th professional side in Britain, will look to recruit most of their players from the eight Welsh Conference sides.  O'Callaghan said the success and popularity of the Welsh Conference has proved the sport has a loyal following in south Wales.  "We feel that the time is right for professional rugby league in South Wales," he added.  "For the first time an infrastructure is in place with so much junior development of the sport taking place as well as the successful TotalRL.com Conference division."  Richard Lewis, the RFL's executive chairman, said: "The admission of the Celtic Crusaders is recognition of the progress that the sport is making in Wales.  "The Crusaders come into professional rugby league playing out of the excellent Brewery Field Stadium in Bridgend and having lodged a robust business plan with the RFL."
