The singer has visited various locations in the Wye Valley and is thought to be interested in buying a house in Catbrook, near Tintern.  The Grove, a six bedroomed property, is on the market with a price tag in excess of Â£850,000.  Her management said it was a personal matter but said she had been looking to buy a property in the area.  "It is a personal matter but she has certainly been thinking about it," said a spokeswoman for 45 Management.  "But it's not just Melanie, it is with her partner and so is a private thing.  "I hope people will allow them their privacy on this matter," she said.  According to the website of Rogers, Roscoe and Knight, the estate agents handling the sale, the house is "a delightful family house, 700 ft above sea level and only two miles from the Wye Valley village of Tintern."  It boasts extensive lawns, six bedrooms, a large kitchen and three spacious reception rooms and "is ideal for families".  A recent refurbishment of the property, which has been owned by one family for the last 75-years, has been undertaken and the gardens extend to over an acre with "complete privacy and a sheltered position".  Although not mentioned by the estate agent, Melanie C might already have noted that Rockfield recording studios, which has hosted the likes of Coldplay, Catatonia and Oasis, is only 12 miles away.  A spokeswoman for the estate agents refused to comment on the rumours about the star's interest.  If the singer, who found fame as Sporty Spice during the 1990s, buys the property, it will be her third home - she owns a flat in London and a house in Albert Dock, Liverpool.  Melanie C is planning to release a new album early next year and her management said she has been spending time writing new material for the release.  She will be playing a warm-up gig at Cardiff's Bar Fly venue on 16 June.
