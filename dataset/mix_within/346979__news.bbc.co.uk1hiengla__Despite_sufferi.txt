Former England manager Kevin Keegan has been banned from driving for six months after he was caught speeding.  Keegan, 57, was caught doing 36mph in a 30mph zone on the A69 between Carlisle and Newcastle on 27 August last year - days before quitting Newcastle United.  A letter from his wife was read out at Carlisle Magistrates' Court saying "his head was in turmoil after a meeting at Newcastle United".  Keegan, who was not in court, was also ordered to pay Â£800 costs.  Under the totting up procedure he now has 12 points on his licence and was given an automatic ban.
