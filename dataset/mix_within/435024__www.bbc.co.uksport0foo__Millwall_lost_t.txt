BBC Sport football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a new guest pundit each week this season.  The latest to take centre stage is the actor Gary Oldman. He is starring as the famous spy George Smiley in the new film adaptation of of John Le Carre's novel Lawro's predictions'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'.  Millwall fan Oldman believes Manchester United will continue their blockbusting start to the season by beating Chelsea and backs Tottenham to be in Oscar-winning form against Liverpool, but thinks Manchester City are in line for a Golden Raspberry against Fulham.  A correct result is worth ONE point while a correct score earns THREE points.  Last week, Lawro got two results right and one perfect score, but his five points were beaten by Hard-Fi singer Richard Archer, who scored eight points.  Lawro's best score: seven points (week three).  Lawro's worst score: five points (week one, two and four).  Make your own predictions to see how the Premier League will look after this weekend.
