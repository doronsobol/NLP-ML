Armin Meiwes, who is awaiting trial, told a German newspaper he wants to deter other people from copying him.  Mr Meiwes, from Rotenburg, says his victim was a willing participant who ate part of his own body before Mr Meiwes stabbed him to death and stored his remains in a freezer.  The 41-year-old computer expert is expected to go on trial on 3 December.  The grisly details of the case caused a sensation in the German media when Mr Meiwes was arrested in December, 2002.  Mr Meiwes told investigators he took Mr Brandes back to his home, where Mr Brandes agreed to have his penis cut off, which Mr Meiwes then flambeed and served up to eat together.  Mr Meiwes says he then killed Mr Brandes with his consent - recording the two-hour event on video.  "I admit what I've done," Mr Meiwes told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. "I accept that I am guilty and I regret my actions."  Mr Meiwes said he wants to write his life story with the aim of deterring anyone who wanted to copy him.  Disturbingly, a number of websites dedicated to Mr Meiwes have appeared, with people advertising for willing victims.  "They should go for treatment, so it doesn't escalate like it did with me," said Mr Meiwes.  He said he believed there were about 800 "cannibals" in Germany.  Prosecutors are seeking a conviction of murder for "sexual satisfaction", as cannibalism is not technically illegal under German law.
