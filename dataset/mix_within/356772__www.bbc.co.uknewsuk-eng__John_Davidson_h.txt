A police inquiry has begun after a smashed glass bottle was found on a plaque in south London honouring the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence.  Members of the public told police on Sunday morning that the plaque on a pavement in Well Hall Road in Eltham had a broken glass bottle on it.  Police said they were investigating how the glass came to be there.  The plaque, placed where 18-year-old Stephen was killed in 1993, has been targeted three times since 1995.  No arrests have been made over the incident.  Since the plaque was unveiled in the teenager's memory it has been chipped and had paint and flammable liquids poured on it.  Unrelated to this incident, Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, both of south London, deny murdering the teenager in April 1993.  They are expected to go on trial on 14 November.
