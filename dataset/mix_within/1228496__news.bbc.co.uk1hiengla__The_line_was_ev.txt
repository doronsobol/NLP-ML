The central London department store's owner, and father of Dodi, Mohammed Al Fayed, commissioned the statue which bears the inscription Innocent Victims.  He maintains their deaths in a Paris car crash in 1997 were not an accident.  French investigators blamed the crash on the driver Henri Paul, who was drunk and speeding. A Met Police inquiry into their deaths is due to end this year.  On Wednesday floral tributes, photos and messages were left at the gates of the Princess's former home, Kensington Palace, to mark the anniversary of her death.  The bronze was created by 80-year-old Bill Mitchell, who is the artistic design advisor to Harrods.  It depicts them dancing beneath an albatross.  Mr Al Fayed said he wanted to keep the pair's "spirit alive" through the statue.
