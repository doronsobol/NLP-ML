Team manager Matt Busby was described as being the most seriously hurt and is being given blood transfusions in hospital.  Star striker Bobby Charlton has been treated for slight head injuries.  According to the Chief Executive of BEA, A. H. Milward, there was a heavy snowstorm in Munich and the pilot delayed departure because he was dissatisfied with one of the plane's engines.  This was the first fatal accident for this type of BEA aeroplane, which has carried 2,340,000 passengers on 86,000 flights since it began service in 1952.  The same plane - called Lord Burghley - took the Manchester United entourage out to Belgrade on Monday.
