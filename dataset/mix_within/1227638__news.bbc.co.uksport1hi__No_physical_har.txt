The former Republic of Ireland boss met the Leeds squad at Thorp Arch on Monday morning before signing a contract until the end of the season.  He left his role as Republic boss in October after an unsuccessful Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.

Staunton, who won 102 international caps for the Republic, has previously worked with McAllister at Coventry.
