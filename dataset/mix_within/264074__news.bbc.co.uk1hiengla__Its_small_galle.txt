The firm's car and light truck tyre plant has been making tyres at its Fordhouses plant on the Stafford Road for more than 70 years.  More than 400 people will lose their jobs, leaving 600 making remoulds and tyres for tractors.  Goodyear Dunlop said it needed to transfer the work to its other locations in the UK and Europe to remain competitive.  The MP for Wolverhampton south east, Dennis Turner, said: "It's the end of an era, it will also mean the loss of friendship and comradeship at the plant.  The firm informed the Department of Trade and Industry and the unions in September of its plans to cut production in Wolverhampton and warned that up to 420 staff could be affected.  A 90-day consultation process with unions and individuals was held following the announcement.  The job cuts represented 10% of the company's 4,000-strong workforce in the UK.  Those working in Goodyear's Birmingham and Washington, Tyne & Wear, factories are not affected by the announcement.  Since 1997 about 2,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost at the Wolverhampton factory.
