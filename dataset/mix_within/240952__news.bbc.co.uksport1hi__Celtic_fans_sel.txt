The 35-year-old Swedish striker, who began his loan spell with the Premiership leaders in January, will return to Helsingborg on 12 March.  "I'm not saying that I'm not flattered or grateful to get the opportunity to extend my stay but there are other things I need to think about," he said.  "The Swedish season starts at the end of March. I need to get back for it."  The former Celtic and Barcelona forward also revealed he was not comfortable with having to commute from Sweden.  "I am going back and forward and it's not an ideal situation," he said.  But he added: "This is a great adventure for me.  "I arrived in January and I'm going home in March to play in Sweden. It suits me perfectly."  Larsson has scored two goals in eight games for United, including a strike on his debut against Aston Villa.  He made an impact at Celtic, where he scored 242 goals in over 300 games after joining the Scottish giants in 1997, and found the net twice during the 3-2 defeat by Porto in the 2003 Uefa Cup final.  There was better luck in European competition for the Swede last season when he came on as substitute to help Barcelona beat Arsenal 2-1 in the Champions League final.  On the international stage, Larsson has scored 36 goals in 93 games for Sweden, finding the target in three World Cups.
