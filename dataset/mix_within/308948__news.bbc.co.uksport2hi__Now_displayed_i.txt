IOC inspector Denis Oswald is confident the facilities will be ready for the start of the Games but warned there is a lot of hard work to do first.  "The deadline of August 13 looms larger by the day," Oswald said. "There is no time to take our eyes off the ball.  "And it is vital that current completion dates be respected."  Oswald was on a two-day visit to Athens to check on the progress of the Olympic complex.  The biggest concern for IOC chiefs continues to be the construction of a glass and steel roof over the main stadium.  The structure - designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and featuring twin steel arches supporting the translucent glass strands - is expected to be finished by May.  Transport links are also slowing down progress in the Greek capital as a new subway system, a new 20-mile stretch of surburban railway and a 15-mile tramway system have yet to be completed.  Construction work in Athens was delayed three years ago but organisers have since worked hard to get the schedule back on track.
