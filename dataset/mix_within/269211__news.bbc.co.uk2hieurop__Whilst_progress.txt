Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.

The rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army have thought long and hard about whether they should attend peace talks in Paris at the weekend.  For now, though, the killing goes on and it has taken a new turn with a spate of terrorist attacks on bars and cafes in the capital, Pristina.  "Not many Serbs can you now find after three pm or four pm. Nobody travels during the night because people are scared. The KLA is again on the roads."  At lunchtime in an Albanian bar I visited it is busy but, at night, it is a different story. Like the Serbs, many Albanians dare not venture out after dark.  One Albanian resident, Linda Gusia told me: "It's terrifying because it's different when you go and fight with a gun and it's different when you die drinking coffee. It's really stupid when you die drinking coffee. It's terrifying. You don't feel safe anywhere. You have this feeling of insecurity wherever you go."  Until recently, most of this conflict has been confined to the countryside but in the capital Pristina there is a palpable sense of fear that it, too, could be engulfed in the fighting if the peace talks fail.  For the residents of the city, the ultimate nightmare is that their hometown could become another Sarajevo.
