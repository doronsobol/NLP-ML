The Welshman had previously managed Stoke between November 2002 and June 2005 - before taking over at Home Park in September 2005.  The Potters have been searching for a boss since Johan Boskamp's departure.  "I have received a request from Stoke for permission to talk to our manager. That has not been granted," Argyle chairman Paul Stapleton said.  "No-one at the club will make a further comment on this situation until and unless circumstances change."  Pulis has also managed Bournemouth, Gillingham, Bristol City and Portsmouth.  Stoke's approach follows the recent takeover of the Staffordshire club by a consortium headed by chairman Peter Coates, who has become chairman for a second time.  Coates' consortium bought the majority shareholding of the Potters' former Icelandic owners, who had sacked Pulis in June 2005 - but their search for a replacement for Boskamp must continue.  Coates added: "This approach has been refused, and the club has no further comment to make at this time."
