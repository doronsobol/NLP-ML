Police in India say they have arrested a Delhi-based journalist in connection with last month's bomb targeting an Israeli diplomat's wife in the city.  A freelance Indian journalist has been arrested and is being questioned, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said.  A motorcyclist placed a device on the embassy car in Delhi at a traffic light on 13 February. The blast injured four people, one seriously.  Israel blamed Iran for the attack but Tehran has denied the charge.  Indian officials have refused to point the finger while the investigations continue.  Syed Mohammed Kazmi was arrested on Tuesday after investigations showed he had been in touch with a suspect police believed might have stuck a magnetic bomb to the diplomat's car, the Associated Press news agency quoted Mr Bhagat as saying.  Police said they had searched Mr Kazmi's house over the past two days to gather evidence, but gave no details of what they found.  Reports said Mr Kazmi, 50, was an Indian citizen who worked as a journalist for an Iranian publication.  In the attack in February, the wife of an Israeli defence ministry official was seriously wounded. She underwent spinal surgery in the city before she was flown to Israel.  David Goldfarb, the spokesman for Israel's Delhi embassy, said the diplomat's car was close to the building on Aurangzeb Road when the explosion went off.  On the same day, a bomb underneath a diplomat's car in the Georgian capital Tbilisi was defused.  Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was behind both incidents.  But Iranian officials denied the claims as "sheer lies".
