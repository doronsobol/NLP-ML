Knopfler was riding a Honda motorbike when he was involved in a collision with a Fiat Punto car on Monday.  The 53-year-old singer and guitarist suffered a broken collar bone and six broken ribs in the accident which happened in London's smart Belgravia district in mid-morning traffic.  A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "Police were called by a member of the public at 10.49am yesterday to reports of a road traffic collision in Grosvenor Road, London SW1, near the junction with Claverton Street.  "It is believed a red Fiat Punto motor car was in collision with a Honda motorcycle."  Knopfler was taken by ambulance to St Thomas' Hospital in central London where he was treated for his injuries.  A hospital spokesman said he was in a stable condition and had been discharged from the hospital by 6pm.  The car's female driver was unhurt in the crash, police said.  Knopfler enjoyed a string of hits with 1980s group Dire Straits including Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing.  The band is probably best known for its album Brothers in Arms, which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide.  Knopfler has also written the soundtrack to five films, including The Princess Bride and Local Hero.  He is due to begin a European concert tour in April.  Other celebrities who have suffered recent motorcycle crashes include Liam Neeson, who suffered a broken pelvis after crashing into a deer near his New York state home in July 2000.  Keanu Reeves nearly died after falling off his motorbike in 1997. He spent several weeks on crutches.
