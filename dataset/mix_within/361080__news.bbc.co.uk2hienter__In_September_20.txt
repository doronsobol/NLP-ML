Faithfull, 59, called off concert dates after being diagnosed with early stage cancer and undergoing surgery.  In a statement, she said "it has been an extraordinary experience and, in many ways, extremely positive".  A spokesman said the 60s star is making a "rapid return to full health" and hopes to resume touring in the spring.  "I didn't realise how many true friends I had. I feel so lucky and loved and thank everybody for all their good thoughts," she said.  A spokesman for the singer said doctors had given her the go-ahead to resume her world tour next year, beginning in Europe, in Budapest, in March, before heading to North America.  Faithfull has been a recording artist for four decades, since being discovered by Rolling Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham.  Stones' stars, including Sir Mick Jagger, wrote her first single, As Tears Go By. Subsequent hits include Come And Stay with Me and This Little Bird.  She has also appeared in a number of films, including a role in the recent Sofia Coppola film Marie Antoinette.
