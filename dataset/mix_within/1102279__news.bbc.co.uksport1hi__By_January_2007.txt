By January 2007, Earnshaw was top-scorer in the division with 17 goals, but suffered a severe groin injury in training, that looked to have put him out of action for the rest of the season.

The 24-year-old Wales international was the club's leading scorer last season.  Robson said: "Earnie has handed in a transfer request and I've turned it down. All of my strikers have an important role to play this season."  Robson is keen to keep Earnshaw as West Brom will lose both striker Kanu and winger Diomansy Kamara in January when they play in the African Nations Cup.  Kanu is due to link up with Nigeria, while Kamara will join Senegal.  Earnshaw has made just league start this season, scoring one goal, in the 4-0 win against Everton last month.  He arrived at The Hawthorns in August 2004 from Cardiff City for Â£3m and his goals helped Albion avoid relegation last season.  In November he said he was concerned his international career would suffer if he did not start more regularly for West Brom.
