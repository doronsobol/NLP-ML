It is believed to be the first time that any of Saddam Hussein's former aides have been allowed a family visit.  His daughter Zeinab, who travelled from neighbouring Jordan for the meeting, told the BBC he had lost weight and looked old.  But she said he had not complained about how he was being treated.  In May, the Observer newspaper published letters from Mr Aziz written in his lawyer's diary in which he appealed for international help to end what he called "his dire situation".  Mr Aziz was the public face of Saddam Hussein's regime abroad and number 25 on America's most-wanted list.  Since his surrender in April 2003 he has been held at a secret location along with other senior members of Saddam Hussein's regime.  His daughter said she did not know exactly where he was being held, because she, along with Mr Aziz's wife, sister and another daughter, had been driven to see him in a bus with blacked-out windows.  She described him as frail-looking, but she told the BBC that he told them he was receiving his medicine for heart trouble and that he had said losing weight was good for him because of his diabetes.  Mr Aziz has not so far been charged with any specific crimes and according to his lawyer has been encouraged to give evidence against Saddam Hussein, whose trial is expected to begin later this year.  The lawyer says Mr Aziz will not do this, but his daughter said her visit had been too short to discuss such issues.  She said he told the family he had done nothing wrong and that they should not worry about him.
