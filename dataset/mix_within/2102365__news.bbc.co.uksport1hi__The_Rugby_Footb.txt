The Crusaders used the fixture at Bridgend's Brewery Field as a chance to view the fringe players in their squad.  Tries from Oliver Hughes, Lee Williams and Jon Breakingbury had given the home side a 16-4 lead at the break.  But the Quins hit back and it needed a 75th-minute try from Dean Scully, converted by Gareth Lewis, to equalise.  Steve Owen, Lamont Bryan, Olly Bloom, Dennis Tufour and Tim Hartley got the tries for the visitors.  The Crusaders' first competitive match will be against Hemel in the Northern Rail Cup on 12 February.  "This was a good performance considering it was our first ever match and none of our Australian imports were playing," said Crusaders coach Kevin Ellis.  "We're a brand new side and it showed at times, especially in discipline and in the defence, but we know where our errors were and we know what to work on before 12 February."
