When cremation is finished, the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal, which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or, increasingly, recycled.

The crematorium near Tel Aviv opened two years ago to fierce criticism from Israel's orthodox community.  Most Jews believe Jews should be buried according to religious tradition, not cremated.  Police found signs of forced entry at the site and believe Wednesday's fire was started deliberately.  The site's owners had kept its exact location secret, fearing possible attacks from religious groups.  One of the owners, Alon Nativ, told Israeli Army Radio he had received anonymous death threats over the past two years.  A founder of Israel's Zaka organisation, a voluntary emergency response team which collects body parts from accident or bombing sites for burial, denied his group was involved.  However, Yehuda Meshi Zahav told Israeli Army Radio he thought an arson attack on the crematorium would be justified.  "It was an illegal activity, a desecration of the dead and I applaud the destruction of this building, which was destined to disappear in flames."
