Zardad's Dog, by Langlands and Bell, was removed from the Tate Britain display when lawyers realised it could be in contempt of court.  The work will now go on display at the gallery from 3 October 2005.  In July, Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, 42, of London, was found guilty of torture and hostage taking in Afghanistan.  Zardad was given two 20-year terms to run concurrently for the crimes he committed in his home country between 1992 and 1996.  The trial of Zardad at the Old Bailey had begun just days before the opening of the Turner Prize show in October 2004.  The landmark court case heard that Zardad and his men kept a "human dog" to savage their victims.  Zardad's Dog, by Ben Langlands and Nikki Bell, consists of a 12-minute film from the 2002 trial of Abdullah Shah, who served under Zardad.  He was nicknamed Zardad's Dog because of the way he savaged people with his teeth before they were killed.  It was the first capital trial to be held in the Supreme Court in Kabul of since the fall of the Taliban.  Langlands and Bell had been commissioned by the Imperial War Museum to spend time in Afghanistan as official war artists.  They also recorded visits to the site of the giant statues of Buddha at Bamiyan, which were destroyed by the Taliban, and digitally recreated the former home of Osama bin Laden.  The Â£25,000 Turner Prize was eventually won by Jeremy Deller, the artist behind a film about Texas.  Zardad's Dog will go on display in the Lightbox space at Tate Britain.
