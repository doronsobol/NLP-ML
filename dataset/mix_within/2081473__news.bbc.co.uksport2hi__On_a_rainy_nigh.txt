On a rainy night in Sydney, Michalak endured a nightmare game with the boot, scoring only once from five attempts before eventually getting replaced as France, despite scoring first, went on to lose the game 24â€“7.

France utility back Frederic Michalak will have surgery on Wednesday after suffering a knee injury last weekend which could keep him out for a year.  The Toulouse player was stretchered off with torn cruciate ligaments in his side's French Championship win over Stade Francais on Saturday.  "His season is over and he will need a year to come back to his best level," said team manager Guy Noves  "Frederic will undergo surgery on Wednesday in Toulouse."  Michalak, who kicked a penalty after coming on as replacement fly-half in France's 26-20 win over Wales last month, will be replaced by Dimitri Yachvili for Sunday's Six Nations game against Italy.
