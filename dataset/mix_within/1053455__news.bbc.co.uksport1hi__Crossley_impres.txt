The 37-year-old is likely to be the number one keeper at Boundary Park next season, but will also take up a role on the coaching staff.  Crossley, who won eight full caps for his country, made 23 senior appearances in four seasons with Fulham.  He spent part of last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday - and even scored a goal in a 3-3 draw with Southampton.  Crossley has made nearly 500 league and cup appearances with six clubs.  He began his career at Nottingham Forest, and has also played for Millwall, Middlesbrough, Stoke, Fulham and Wednesday.
