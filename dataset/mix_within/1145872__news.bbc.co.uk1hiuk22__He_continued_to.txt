Princess Diana's former lover James Hewitt has spoken out to end persistent rumours that he is Prince Harry's father.  The former cavalry officer said people compared Harry's looks with his own, but he stated categorically: "There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father.  "I can absolutely assure you that I am not."  Prince Harry was "already walking" by the time his relationship with Diana began, he told The Sunday Mirror.  Mr Hewitt was Diana Princess of Wales's secret lover for five years.  Speaking in the paper, he said: "Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine and people say we look alike.  "I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time I must state once and for all that I'm not Harry's father.  "When I met Diana, he was already a toddler."  Referring to portraits by fashion photographer Mario Testino, taken to mark the Prince's 18th birthday a week ago, Hewitt said: "Looking at the pictures I have to say he's a much more handsome chap than I ever was."  He said he was aware the issue of Harry's paternity had been a major talking point.  However, he said he did not meet the Princess, who died in 1997, until two years after Harry was born.  In a book by Diana's former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, the rumours are also quashed.  Mr Wharfe said the gossip used to upset the Princess.  He said in his book: "The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly.  "The nonsense should be scotched here and now.  "Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait."
