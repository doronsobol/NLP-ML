Brian Paddick had said it was he who claimed a close aide of Met chief Sir Ian Blair thought police had shot an innocent man six hours later.  The Met responded that the claim was "simply not true"; Mr Paddick said that amounted to accusing him of lying.  In a statement the Met said "any misunderstanding is regretted".  It added Mr Paddick had accepted its "clarification" and considered the matter closed.  It comes after Mr Paddick, a deputy assistant commissioner, consulted libel lawyers over the Met's original statement.  Sir Ian maintains he did not know the victim was innocent until the next day.  Mr Menezes, a Brazilian electrician, was shot dead at Stockwell station after being mistaken for a suicide bomber, the day after the 21 July failed bombing attempts.
