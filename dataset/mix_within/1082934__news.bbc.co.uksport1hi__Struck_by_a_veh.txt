The 31-year-old Spaniard hit a railing after colliding with Belgian Dimitri de Fauw in the Six Days of Ghent event and died on the way to hospital.  Galvez won gold with Joan Llaneras at this year's world championships in Bordeaux, having also won the title seven years earlier.  The final day of the Ghent event has been cancelled.  Track specialist Galvez rode for Kelme between 2000 and 2003 before switching to the Illes Balears-Caisse d'Epargne team.  He was second to Australian Robbie McEwan on the fourth stage of this year's Tour de France.
