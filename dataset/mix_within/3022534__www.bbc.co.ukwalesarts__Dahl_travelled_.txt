Dahl travelled to visit Thomas's hut in Carmarthenshire, Wales in the 1950s and, after taking a look inside, decided to make a replica of it to write in.

Roald Dahl spent two years at the Cathedral School in Llandaff, from the age of seven to nine. He then moved to St Peter's boarding school in Weston-super-Mare and suffered from homesickness. At the age of 13 he moved on to Repton School in Derbyshire.  Dahl's largely unhappy time at school is chronicled in Boy, the memoir of his childhood, in which he shares stories about his school days and his family.
