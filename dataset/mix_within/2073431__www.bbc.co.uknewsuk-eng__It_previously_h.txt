Plans have gone on display for the derelict Tropicana swimming pool on Weston-super-Mare's seafront.  Businessman Richard Nightingale, who is behind the bid, Is asking the public to chose from three designs.  The most popular idea will be put forward to North Somerset Council planners.  A previous scheme by construction firm Henry Boot to create a new swimming pool and leisure facilities at the former lido was hit by the recession.  Mr Nightingale's plans, which are on show at his offices in Station Road, have the backing of the town's MP John Penrose.  "It's great to see a local businessman with such drive and imagination who's willing to invest millions in the town's future.  "There's a long way to go but, if all the proposals are as good as this, Weston will have a wonderful range of high-quality choices for regenerating this crucial seafront site," Mr Penrose added.  Plans by rival bidders will go on show in September.  North Somerset Council is looking to re-advertise the site, which has been empty since 2000.  It said it did not want the site used for housing and any development should feature an all-season swimming pool.  The Tropicana's heyday was in the 1960s.
