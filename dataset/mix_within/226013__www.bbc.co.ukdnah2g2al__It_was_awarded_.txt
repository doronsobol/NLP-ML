Oh dear.   Sorry about this.  This isn't at all what's supposed to happen.   This is exactly the sort of thing that can cause stress and anxiety.   Those are not good things.  Have a look at this calming image that we've chosen just for occasions such as this. Hopefully it will help keep you calm while we look into the problem.  We apologise for this interruption in your surfing, and hope the tide comes back in soon.
