Manchester United soccer star Carlos Tevez has had his Â£140,000 Bentley seized because he does not have a full UK driving licence, police said.  The 25-year-old Argentina international was stopped by traffic officers on the M60 near Stretford, Greater Manchester. His car has been impounded.  Police said they pulled his car over, suspecting the tinting on its windows was too dark.  Tests at the roadside showed the tint was illegal, police said.  "Shortly after 0920 GMT on Friday officers pulled over a Bentley close to junction 7 of the M60," said a police spokesman.  "The officers were concerned certain windows were illegally tinted. They were tested and found to be too dark so a prohibition notice was issued to the driver.  "When asked to provide his documentation, it was discovered the driver did not have a full UK driving licence and was advised to arrange removal of the car.  "As he could not arrange this, the car was removed under Section 165 of Road Traffic Act 1988."
