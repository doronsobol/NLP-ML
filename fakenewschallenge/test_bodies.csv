0,"Hundreds of black and white youths have taken to the streets of Brixton, in south London attacking police, ransacking shops and burning cars after the death of a black man in police custody.  About 50 police officers in riot gear have formed a line across Brixton's main road to stifle pockets of trouble and prevent anyone entering the area - the scene of massive rioting in 1981 caused by racial tensions.  One report said two shots were fired as the centre of the demonstration moved into the area of the Ritzy cinema.  A police motor cyclist is reported to have been pulled from his machine by a crowd of at least 10 rioters.  Officers have sealed off a two-mile area around the centre of Brixton and both Brixton and neighbouring Stockwell tube stations have been closed.  A police helicopter has been despatched over the area.  Riots broke out after a peaceful picket of the police station - triggered by the death last week of Wayne Douglas, 26.  Police said Mr Douglas, who was being questioned about a burglary, collapsed at the local police station.  A post-mortem later revealed he had suffered from heart disease.  The protest about his death developed into a march down Brixton's main street.  A standoff ensued between the police and about 100 demonstrators triggering a backlash of violence.  Witnesses have reported hearing groups of black youths shouting ""Killers, killers"" at the police.  A spokeswoman for the police said seven civilian casualties had been reported so far, and police were also dealing with sporadic pockets of trouble in the area around Brixton town centre.  She said there had been unconfirmed reports of petrol bombs being ignited.  ""Officers were wearing protective clothing because we had reports of missiles being thrown,"" she added.  ""We gave them every opportunity to move off peacefully but they hadn't done so."""
1,"        I'm here with Humphrey Lyttelton who is chairman of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. He's a jazz trumpeter of legend, national treasure, humorist, calligrapher, and subversive, I think. Congratulations on getting to thirty years with this show.     Thank you very much. I don't know how we've done it but it's nice to be here.    It's been thirty years. You were there from the very beginning, but you weren't always the host. Is that right?     At the very beginning, I did the pilot because in those days, anybody that did any broadcasting - and I'd done a bit about music, about jazz, and things - anybody who did any broadcasting and sounded articulate would eventually be called on to do some kind of a pilot, you know. And that sample programme one hoped would go on the air. They never did, 90 percent of them went down the plug after they'd been done because the producers had a budget every year and if they didn't do enough of them, they would cut their budgets. And they used to do them. I thought this was one of them and you pick up a studio fee. No chance it would be coming out. So, I went in and did the first one. They tried to do it all ad-lib which meant that I sat there in the middle of four people, sweating profusely, because on radio with no studio time to go back and re-do an ad-lib situation, it's very nerve wracking.    But you'd not been known in radio. You were a jazz man, basically?     Yes.    So how did it occur to anyone to have you as the chairman?     Well, I had started a programme which is even longer running than this one in 1967 which was a jazz programme called The Best of Jazz and that still goes out on Monday nights. That's been going for 33 years or something. So, they knew that I could talk in a microphone. I did the pilot, and when they came through and said they were going to put it on the air, I had already some dates in the book with my band and so on. So Barry did the first one, he may have done a few more than the first one in the series, and I took it up from then.     You were sustaining a pretty hefty tour schedule during all this. Tim and Graeme were making The Goodies all through the 70s. When did you find time?     Well, it's not very time consuming because we do, we record them two at a time, and of course we do them in huge theatres - I think 1400 at Milton Keynes was the biggest, so that occupies… we do six in the spring, that means three usually Sunday nights and six more in the late autumn. So, that's only really six days out of the year so it doesn't occupy an enormous amount of time. The teams usually arrive a day earlier and sort out some things like the musical games. I just stroll in right before the recording goes on.    I notice you had a quick read through the cards. Is that about as much preparation as it takes now?     I have to do that because, as Jon Naismith told the audience tonight, he brought on Iain Pattinson who for ten years has written my introductions and the leads in to the different little games. And some people say ""We thought it was you"". For me, it's a bigger challenge, it's much harder to do and much more rewarding to do well, then just to think up stuff of your own, hit or miss, because you've got to see to it that you don't torpedo any of his punch lines. And therefore you have to think about the timing and judge it correctly so that, for instance, a good joke doesn't disappear in laughter or applause or anything like that.    Although a good portion is written down, there do seem to be these occasional ad-libs that basically bring the house down.     Well, it's all part of my persona on the programmeme of a grumpy chairman. When I first did the first real show, not the pilot, I drove in thinking ""What am I going to do? I've got four professional comedians, comic actors... I can't chip in with anything worth chipping in"". By the time I got to the theatre, I thought ""Well, that's is exactly how I will present myself: as somebody who has come in the midst of all these people and there's a slight hint that he doesn't really want to be there and slightly grumpy about everything"". And I've done that for 30 years now.    More...     "
2,"Staff at Lidl supermarkets are being stopped from speaking any language other than English in their UK stores - including Welsh.  The retailer said its policy is for staff to speak in English to customers, irrespective of their native language.  It comes after two staff members in Scotland were banned from speaking Polish to each other on their tea break.  The store said it was to ensure all its staff and customers ""felt comfortable"".  ""It is Lidl UK company policy that staff speak in English to customers, irrespective of their native language,"" the company told the BBC Welsh-language website Cymru Fyw.  ""This is for the benefit of all our customers as well as our staff to ensure a comfortable environment where all feel included.  ""However, it goes without saying that our staff are able to assist a customer by conversing in their native tongue, if the customer is unable to speak any English.""  The Welsh Language Society (Cymdeithas yr Iaith) said the policy was ""appalling"".  Its chairman, Jamie Bevan, added that ""since the Welsh language bill was passed four years ago, it is illegal to stop staff from speaking to customers in Welsh"".  Welsh Language Commissioner Meri Huws said she will respond in due course.  The Welsh government said: ""The Welsh language has official status in Wales, and there are provisions in the Welsh language measure to protect people's freedom to use the language.  ""The Welsh language commissioner has the power to investigate any allegations of this and can produce reports for Welsh ministers to consider."""
3,"BBC Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo has carried out thousands of interviews in a broadcasting career which has also taken in Radio 1 and BBC Radio 5 live.  But the 56-year-old, who has also released a series of children's books, was on the receiving end for once when he visited Sibford School in Oxfordshire, with School Reporters Nat and Fergus asking the questions.  Q: Have you always wanted to be in radio?  A: Yes is the answer to that. I always thought I wanted to work in radio, but maybe as a studio manager - to be in charge of the sound balance and so on but I failed the hearing test, so I had to re-think the whole thing. I went into local radio and then started presenting and realised that that's what I wanted to do.  Q: What's the most difficult challenges you are presented with when doing live radio?  A: The most difficult time is probably when you are interviewing someone who doesn't want to be interviewed. Actors sign on and they have to do promotion, but a lot of them don't want to do promotion, so they come over very badly and I want to throttle them!  Q: You have a confessions feature, which is very popular. Do you have any confessions to share?  A: This is a mild confession really: on my birthday my producer had arranged for the supermodel Naomi Campbell to come in with a birthday cake.  When she came in I wasn't sure who she was. I was live on the radio and my producer (the idiot), never said 'it's Naomi Campbell' until about five minutes later. That was sort of embarrassing, and I had to apologise to her afterwards. I don't think that would get on air on the show!  Q: Have you been surprised by the success of your books?  A: I set out to write it for my son, and it was only because he liked it that I thought maybe other people would like it. If you told me there was going to be three books, I would have been very surprised.  Q: When you were writing the books, did you ever struggle with writer's block?  A: Not writer's block as much as it is conventionally understood which is people saying 'I can't write anything'. There are many days were two paragraphs is all you're going to get. So it wasn't writer's block in that I couldn't think of anything to write, but sometimes it is a lot slower then what it should be.  Q: Do you have a favourite time to write?  A: Because my radio show is in the afternoon, I always try to do writing in the morning. I used to try to work in the morning and write a thousand words a day but that doesn't really work anymore. So now, I write any time, all the time, wherever I can find a space.  Q: Now you have become a successful author, what advice would you give to people aspiring to be authors?  A: The conventional advice is probably the best advice. That is to read as much as you possibly can. Read stuff you know you like, you think you might like and just expand the sort of stuff you are reading.  I think of it as input and output; the more stuff that comes in, the more you have got going around in your head and the more creative your story will become.  Q: The music industry has changed a lot in the last 10 years, with music streaming. Is it a good thing for the music industry and musicians?  A: It doesn't really matter if it is a good thing, it is a thing and it is happening and the whole of music and the whole of radio has to adapt and move on and change. I think radio almost has to become like a live streaming service anyway.  Whether it is good or bad, some people will benefit and some people won't, but it is the future so they have to adapt really or get left behind."
4,"Marks out of 10 for the Arsenal and Southampton players following their FA Cup final.  David Seaman: Looked occasionally nervy with his kicking and in coming for the ball, yet made a very important save from Ormerod's shot.  Lauren: Steady defensively, though contributed little going forward. Made a brave challenge to block Jo Tessem's shot.  Martin Keown: Emerged bruised and battered as well as with a booking for a tackle on Ormerod. All-in-all a typical day's work for Keown as he picked up another winners' medal.  Oleg Luzhny: Supposedly one of the weak links in the Arsenal defence, emerged with an enhanced reputation after making some key challenges and clearances.  Ashley Cole: Attacking impetus thwarted by Gordon Strachan's decision to pair Chris Baird and Paul Telfer on the right. Cleared Beattie's header off the line in stoppage time.  Freddie Ljungberg: Gradually emerged as a threat as he started to arrive in the box in dangerous positions, notably when he hit the side-netting soon after the restart.  Ray Parlour: Provided plenty of drive and together with Gilberto ensured Arsenal won control of the centre of midfield.  Gilberto: Brought some Brazilian flair to the final, notably the way he spread the play with some raking passes.  Robert Pires: Initially subdued by Baird and Telfer on the left wing, the Frenchman intelligently moved infield and slipped his markers for the goal.  Dennis Bergkamp: Linked the play with some superb passes and made a great run in the build-up to Pires' goal.  Thierry Henry: As against Liverpool two years ago missed a number of chances, though his vision and pace was an irritant to the Southampton defence throughout.  Sylvain Wiltord (replaced Bergkamp): Had a quiet game as Arsenal killed the match.  Antti Niemi: Kept Southampton in the game in the first minute when he spread himself to deny Henry. Went off injured with a calf injury after making an innocuous clearance.  Chris Baird: In only his third appearance showed maturity beyond his years as he cleared off the line and tested Seaman with a clever shot.  Claus Lundekvam: Embarrassed by Henry in the opening minute and could well have been sent off had referee Graham Barber not decided to play the advantage.  Michael Svensson: Important for Southampton on set-pieces but often left chasing shadows trying to contain Henry and Bergkamp.  Wayne Bridge: Together with Chris Marsden stifled Lauren and Ljunberg on the Arsenal right, but struggled to get forward until the game's later stages.  Paul Telfer: Kept Pires subdued early on, but let the Frenchman go for the first goal. Focused more on defensive rather than attaking duties.  Anders Svensson Did his best to break up Arsenal's passing movements, but his creative input suffered as he concentrated on his defensive duties.  Matt Oakley: Never tired in trying to deny Henry and Bergkamp service, but struggled in prompting Southampton attacks.  Chris Marsden: Steadying influence in midfield and put in a steady stream of crosses from the left.  James Beattie: Certainly made his physical presence felt, but had to be content with scraps in terms of chances.  Brett Ormerod: Worked his socks off and had Southampton's best chance when he tested Seaman with a fierce shot.  Paul Jones (replaced Niemi): Came on for the injured Niemi midway through the second half and made a good save from Henry's deflected shot.  Jo Tessem (replaced Anders Svensson): Almost scored with his first touch, but his shot was blocked by Lauren."
5,"Hundreds of vehicles are stranded on both sides of the border on the Trans-Gambian Highway.  A Senegalese government official says that the border will remain shut until the situation is brought under control.  The clashes erupted during Saturday's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Senegal's capital, Dakar.  In a radio interview, Gambian President Yayha Jammeh urged his compatriots to calm down, while the Senegalese Interior Minister, General Mamadou Niang, made a similar speech in Dakar.  The Senegalese interior minister described what happened as regrettable and appealed for calm.  Reports said a Senegalese citizen had been killed in Gambia, but General Niang denied the reports.  A BBC reporter, Alpha Jallow, was violently attacked and robbed by a group of youths on Saturday night in Ziguinchor in Senegal because he is Gambian.  He is now in Tambacounda where he told BBC News Online that tension remained high.  In Gambia, Senegalese nationals have been attacked by locals incensed by the treatment of their compatriots at the match on Saturday, which Senegal won 3-1.  Gambians responded by attacking Senegalese residents and destroying cars and buildings.  Many Senegalese in Gambia are now in hiding, or under the protection of the army.  Some 200 Senegalese have sought shelter at their embassy in Banjul, demanding to be repatriated.  Senegalese and Gambian police officers are meeting at the Gambian border post of Amdalai to co-ordinate their response to the problem."
6,"Margaret Thatcher was urged to abandon Liverpool to ""managed decline"" by her chancellor, newly-released National Archives files have revealed.  The confidential government documents, made available under the 30-year rule, reveal Cabinet discussions following the July 1981 Toxteth riots.  But then-Chancellor Lord Howe has said his short letter was misunderstood.  The riots, which lasted for eight days, followed the arrest of Leroy Alphonse Cooper on Selborne Street.  Some 460 police officers were injured during the disturbances, which began on 3 July.  More than 70 buildings were demolished or burnt down as tensions boiled over between the police and the district's African-Caribbean community.  While ministers such as the then Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Heseltine, were arguing for regeneration funding to rebuild the riot-hit communities, Sir Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe, thought it would be a waste of money.  He warned Mrs Thatcher ""not to over commit scarce resources to Liverpool"".  ""I fear that Merseyside is going to be much the hardest nut to crack,"" he said.  ""We do not want to find ourselves concentrating all the limited cash that may have to be made available into Liverpool and having nothing left for possibly more promising areas such as the West Midlands or, even, the North East.  ""It would be even more regrettable if some of the brighter ideas for renewing economic activity were to be sown only on relatively stony ground on the banks of the Mersey.  ""I cannot help feeling that the option of managed decline is one which we should not forget altogether. We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.""  He acknowledged the suggestion the city could be left to decline was potentially explosive.  ""This is not a term for use, even privately,"" he warned Mrs Thatcher.  But speaking to the BBC News Channel on Friday Lord Howe said: ""I wasn't in any sense advocating managed decline. The whole of that is based on some misunderstanding of some short letter with specific objectives.""  Lord Howe, who had been MP for the Wirral seat of Bebbington from 1964 to 1966, said he was only warning about depriving other areas of resources which might go to Liverpool.  He added: ""Liverpool had been undergoing an unmanaged decline and we had to see if there were any devices to begin turning the decline around.""  Lord Howe said Liverpool people should not be angered by his letter of 30 years ago as it was only pointing out that decline be managed until it could be reversed, adding: ""Managed decline certainly wasn't an objective.""  As the government sought to respond to the situation in 1981, Mr Heseltine was despatched to Liverpool. He reported back by phone to Mrs Thatcher on 25 July.  The cabinet papers note: ""Mr Heseltine considered the behaviour of the police in Liverpool 8 to be quite horrifying. They were not acting in a racialist fashion. They treated all suspects in a brutal and arrogant manner.""  Mr Heseltine also said there were too many young recruits in the area and the local commander had a ""fortress mentality"".  Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Lord Heseltine said the idea of abandoning Liverpool was never an option.  He said: ""It never really got any traction for the simplest reason that the cabinet minister responsible for so much of the policy that affected the city was me.  ""I simply wouldn't countenance that you could say that one of England's great cities, a world city, was going into managed decline here.""  He added: ""I think we should be judged not by all the correspondence and all the arguments, and all the classic sort of responses you get from the Treasury.  ""The judgement should be about did we do the right thing? And I haven't the slightest doubt we did do the right thing - and we learned a lot of lessons.""  The cabinet documents also reveal the confidential meetings Mrs Thatcher had with civic, community and church leaders.  In a meeting with church leaders she said she was amazed at the hatred for the police in Liverpool 8.  The then Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool Derek Worlock said although there was a ""profound mistrust"" of the police this was not the cause of the rioting.  Instead he told her there was a ""silent colour bar"" in a city where there were no black councillors and just eight black policemen.  Lord David Alton, who was Liberal MP for Edge Hill at the time of the riots, told BBC Radio Merseyside: ""Many people guessed that this was the impulse driving politics at the time.  ""This idea of managed decline, that you can simply let one of the country's great cities slip into the River Mersey and opt for decay rather than renewal, shows an ambivalence to the north of England which still affects politics to this day.""  He said he had made a speech in the Commons warning there was a ""time bomb ticking away in the heart of the city as a result of the massive levels of unemployment"".  He added: ""It was like creating a museum of horrifying example that if you behaved in the way that they claimed that militants were doing in Liverpool, then the warning was that what was happening to Liverpool will happen to the rest of you.  ""So I think it was used for very crude political purposes."""
7,"Figge, who took up the job in August 2002, had been charged with taking the team to the 2004 Nations Cup in Tunisia.  The German coach will be replaced by Asrat Haile.  Despite being second in their African Nations Cup qualifying group, which includes Guinea, Liberia and Niger, Figge was dismissed for ""failing to provide the documents"" needed to support his application for the post."
8,"Newcastle continued their unbeaten start to the season as Ryan Taylor's stunning goal saw off Everton.  Everton defender Johnny Heitinga turned in Danny Simpson's inviting low cross before Taylor doubled the lead when he crashed in a 25-yard shot.  Jack Rodwell headed in a corner to give Everton hope and the visitors should have been given a second-half penalty when Dan Gosling handballed.  But Alan Pardew's side closed out a win which keeps them third in the table.  Newcastle are now undefeated in the league since a 3-0 loss at Liverpool in May - a run of 14 games - but face a tough test of their ambitions in their next three fixtures.  Pardew takes his side to Manchester City and Manchester United on successive Saturdays after the international break, with Chelsea visiting St James' Park the following week.  But the Newcastle manager will have been concerned at the sight of influential midfielder Yohan Cabaye limping off with a groin injury.  Midfielder Danny Guthrie had the first effort on goal after a corner had not been cleared before Everton had a chance to open the scoring.  Seamus Coleman dragged his shot wide after Louis Saha had flicked on a Royston Drenthe cross from the left.  It proved to be a costly miss as Heitinga inadvertently put Newcastle ahead moments later.  Simpson's cross from the right was dangerous and Heitinga could only turn the ball past Tim Howard with Leon Best lurking just behind.  Drenthe created two quick chances for Everton but Rodwell and Leon Osman both had efforts saved by Tim Krul before Saha got in behind a faltering offside trap but lacked composure and blazed over.  Taylor then opened up a two-goal cushion in spectacular fashion.  Rodwell headed a long throw clear to Taylor 25 yards from goal and the full-back chested the ball down and smashed in a shot which arched over Howard before hitting the underside of the crossbar and bouncing in.  Saha hit the post and Taylor saw a cross strike the crossbar before Cabaye limped off to be replaced by former Everton midfielder Gosling.  Rodwell then brought the half to an end when he headed in Drenthe's corner at the near post.  Everton started the second period strongly and should have had a penalty when Saha's shot was blocked by Gosling's arm.  James McFadden came on for his first appearance for Everton since January 2008 as David Moyes' side had plenty of late pressure but Newcastle comfortably held on for the three points.  ""We were unfortunate today as injuries cost us our rhythm but the guys who came on did a great job.  ""If we were at Goodison Park we would have got beat today. But the fans helped us.  ""Our defending was a different class in the second half and it was one of our best displays. When Everton scored just before half-time it affected us but our discipline and defending has got us a victory.  ""I hope the Toon enjoy it tonight. We are a new team, we didn't expect to be on this run but we are enjoying it. We've got Manchester City next, who are also unbeaten, so that could be a great game.""  ""It was a penalty we didn't get today but we've had a lot of that.  ""We were very fortunate against Fulham the other week and you earn your luck.  ""Our defending in the first half wasn't good enough, especially in the opening 20 minutes. It was a terrible own goal to concede.  ""We created enough chances in the first half to get something from the game.  ""We've got to do better and win some football games.""

9,"A BBC investigation has revealed that more than 20 MPs have breached rules in relation to registering and declaring overseas trips paid for by foreign governments.  The trips taken by Norman Baker, his relevant parliamentary activities and his reply to the BBC are below.  Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes Norman Baker visited India, at the expense of the Tibet Society of the UK, in October 2007.  He again visited India in September 2008 to visit the Tibetan government-in-exile, which met his costs along with the Tibet Society.  Following these visits Mr Baker asked the following 21 questions relating to Tibet, along with two supplementary questions, without declaring an interest: 156141, 159320, 168233, 175894 with supplementary, 186588 with a supplementary, 198695, 202423, 210002, 220269 to 220271, 220371, 220372, 226717, 237783, 243953 to 243956, 249326 and 259345.  On 1 April 2008, Mr Baker secured a debate on Tibet. Records of the Summary Agenda and the Weekly Information Bulletin indicate that he did not declare an interest. Whenever an interest is declared, the symbol ""[R]"" appears on the relevant notice or order papers.  Neither did Mr Baker declare an interest during the debate itself, although he did mention a recent visit.  Mr Baker also tabled the following early day motions relating to Tibet without declaring an interest:  In addition, Mr Baker signed the following early day motions relating to Tibet without declaring an interest:  12. 'TIBET AND ASSURANCES FROM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT' / 22.10.2008 / EDM 2331  In response, Mr Baker told the BBC: ""I have had a long-standing interest in Tibet, preceding by many years the two visits to which you refer, and hold positions as vice-chair of the All-Party Tibet Group and President of the Tibet Society.  ""As these positions are unpaid, of course no declaration has been needed, though I have publicly referred to both positions on many occasions.  ""In respect of the two visits to India, such visits have to be registered if the cost met from an external body constitutes more than 1% of salary.  ""In fact, it was not clear in either case that this threshold had been breached, but I thought it right to declare these visits just in case.  ""That notwithstanding, having decided that I would register these visits, I should have then declared a relevant interest in respect of the parliamentary activities you list.  ""It is an unintended oversight that I did not, and I am grateful to you for drawing this to my attention.""  Other MPs who have breached the rules:"
10,"Arsenal recovered from two goals down to thrash Tottenham in an enthralling north London derby at Emirates Stadium.  Spurs - in the ascendancy over Arsenal for so much of the season - looked to be on course for the first back-to-back league wins at the home of their arch-rivals for 86 years as an early goal from Louis Saha and Emmanuel Adebayor's penalty put them in a commanding position within 34 minutes.  But Arsenal, under so much scrutiny after their 4-0 Champions League thrashing against AC Milan in Italy and their FA Cup exit at Sunderland, mounted a comeback that combined resilience and character with dazzling attacking football to humiliate Harry Redknapp's side.  Bacary Sagna's header and a world-class strike from Robin van Persie put Arsenal level before the interval - and set up a second-half display that left Spurs beaten long before the end.  Tomas Rosicky put Arsenal in front just after the break and the rout was completed by a quickfire double from Theo Walcott, goals that silenced the taunts he suffered from his own supporters in the first half.  Spurs, who came from two goals behind to beat Arsenal 3-2 at Emirates Stadium last season, ended with 10 men when Scott Parker was sent off late on.  But the points had already been decided as Arsenal's reward came in the shape of this rousing victory and a place in the Premier League's top four.  It was the second time this season Arsenal hit five against a fellow London team, following their 5-3 victory over Chelsea in October.  Manager Arsene Wenger will take renewed confidence that his side can claim a Champions League place next season after the manner of this win, but the valid question will also remain about why Arsenal have produced such quality so rarely this season.  For Redknapp, with Football Association chairman David Bernstein in the stands as he continues the search for Fabio Capello's successor, this was a chastening afternoon.  The flair and strength that has characterised so much of Spurs's season was conspicuous by its absence as Arsenal threatened to extend their emphatic victory margin.  Redknapp will hope this will simply be an interruption to their impressive progress but he will have been horrified by the ease with which his side was dismantled.  Arsenal's confidence, perhaps fragile in the face of those damaging defeats, was hardly helped by the concession of such a cheap goal inside four minutes. They were left horribly exposed as referee Mike Dean played a fine advantage, allowing Kyle Walker and Adebayor to play in Saha, whose shot was deflected off Thomas Vermaelen over the wrong-footed Szczesny.  The Gunners, however, responded with real spirit as Van Persie sent a close-range shot so close that many Arsenal supporters celebrated prematurely and Rosicky's flicked header was superbly turned over by Brad Friedel.  Spurs, despite Arsenal's good reaction, looked to be cruising 11 minutes before the interval when referee Dean pointed to the spot as Gareth Bale tumbled theatrically under Szczesny's challenge as he pursued a pass of precision from Luka Modric.  Adebayor ignored the protests and jeers of Arsenal's fans to score coolly - but that was the end of the good news for Spurs.  Arsenal's response was ferociously committed, but Spurs collapsed with a speed - and on a scale - that will have startled Redknapp as much as it delighted Wenger.  Van Persie struck the post after being set up by Walcott, but the goal arrived seconds later as Sagna arrived at pace to send a thumping header beyond Friedel from Mikel Arteta's cross.  Arsenal's play was gathering an unstoppable momentum, epitomised by Van Persie's stunning finish, curled away from the diving Friedel two minutes before half-time.  Redknapp took strong action to halt the switch in fortunes, sending on Sandro and Rafael van der Vaart for Saha and Niko Kranjcar - but Spurs had already gone into terminal decline.  Arsenal were in the ascendancy, Friedel saving well from Yossi Benayoun before Rosicky was quicker than Ledley King to react to Sagna's cross and score at the near post after 50 minutes.  With Spurs reeling, Walcott struck twice inside three minutes to transform that early anxiety into a carnival atmosphere inside Emirates Stadium.  Walcott recovered from a poor first touch to send a neat finish past Friedel and was swiftly on target again as he scored with a low shot before being submerged by jubilant team-mates.  And to complete Spurs's misery, Parker was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for a foul on Vermaelen and he will now miss the game against Manchester United at White Hart Lane next Sunday. A day to forget for Redknapp - but one that might be of some significance for Wenger and Arsenal as they set their sights on fourth place.

""It was when they were unprepared to give us more time that we took steps to protect ourselves against winding-up.""  London Broncos recently went into liquidation with debts of over £3m and were only allowed to play on after Super League clubs decided to allow a new, debt-free company, to take over the running of the club.

12,"Councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by Gypsy communities on rural land.  More money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks, said housing minister Yvette Cooper.  In November, MPs urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop.  Ms Cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. That scheme has paid out £25m in four years, with £8m available for 2005.  ""There are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning Gypsy and traveller sites,"" said Ms Cooper.  ""Firstly, local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. And secondly, they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites.  ""The result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the Gypsies and travellers.  ""That is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites, as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment.""  Under the new regulations, expected to be in force in the spring, officials will be able to serve ""temporary stop notices"" aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban.  Many MPs with rural constituencies, particularly in eastern England, have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers, saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.  Andrew Ryder, of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, said: ""We welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for Gypsies and travellers, so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored.  ""New accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers, as they often do.  ""Living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals, legal action and eviction is no one's idea of fun.""  In their November report, MPs from the committee scrutinising the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop.  Numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities, said the MPs. In turn, the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents.  Two of the most controversial traveller sites - Cottenham in Cambridgeshire and Minety in Wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle."
13,"Her computer records stated she had suffered headaches and nausea in December 1997 and early 1998.  Richard Henriques, QC, prosecuting, said a computer entry dated 17 December 1997, described how Miss Ward, 57, of Hyde, Greater Manchester, had complained of headaches, and that she was to notify the local hospital.  But it was made on the day of her death - 18 February 1998, the court was told. Dr Shipman gave the cause of her death as cancer.  The court heard that Miss Ward was taking medication for breast cancer and had received treatment for skin cancer - but was currently in the clear.  After examining Miss Ward's medical records he said he would have expected her to have suffered a variety of symptoms including loss of concentration, lethargy, and drowsiness before her death.  ""To go from being entirely well, having booked a holiday and being in good spirits, is not something one would expect from someone with cancer throughout their body,"" he said.  Dr Shipman, 53, of Mottram, is accused of murdering 15 patients and forging the will of one of them. He denies all the charges.  The court heard how Miss Ward, a higher education teacher, was found dead in her sheltered home by Dr Shipman.  Warden Christine Simpson told Preston Crown Court despite having to pass through two secure doors the GP claimed he walked in and found Maureen ""dead on the bed"".  Mrs Simpson told the court on the morning of 18 February 1998 she had seen Miss Ward briefly.  But around 3.30pm she answered a knock at the door from Mr Shipman who said he had found Miss Ward dead.  Mrs Simpson said: ""I was very, very surprised, very shocked. I said `I can't believe it'. He said to me: `She did have a brain tumour you know'. He said she had had it for a long time.""  As the pair walked over to Miss Ward's flat she asked Mr Shipman how he had got in.  He replied the door had been left open on the latch - something Miss Ward had not done before.  Mr Shipman had an envelope in his hand and told Mrs Simpson he was expected as he was delivering a hospital appointment letter.  Mrs Simpson found Miss Ward, who was a nursery nurse teacher, lying on her bed fully clothed.  The jury then heard that Shipman had recorded Mrs Simpson as being present at the time of death but Mrs Simpson said this was untrue and she was alerted to Miss Ward's death by Shipman.  In his medical records, some of which were back dated, Shipman described how Miss Ward had had a fit in an ambulance - but the court was told that no call to the ambulance service was made from Miss Ward's flat."
14,"Conservative MPs have rallied behind a bill promising an EU referendum in the face of Labour attempts to derail it.  Legislation urging a referendum by 2017 was discussed for five hours but no major votes were held and the debate was adjourned until later this month.  Deputy PM Nick Clegg later criticised the Tories for ""flirting"" with an EU exit, while Labour MPs sought to delay the bill's passage through the Commons.  But its sponsor, Tory MP James Wharton, said it had made ""reasonable progress"".  The first in three days of detailed debate on Mr Wharton's bill concluded with Conservatives and Labour arguing over parliamentary tactics.  In an effort to slow its progress, Labour MPs raised a host of related issues at length, including whether residents of Gibraltar and prisoners should be able to vote in a future referendum.  Mr Cameron's referendum pledge, following a renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels, cannot be made law in the form of a coalition government bill because of Lib Dem opposition.  Bemused by what was going on as the Commons debates the EU Referendum Bill? Don't worry, even most MPs will be a bit bewildered. This is a Private Member's Bill and the rules of debate are a bit different. There is no time limit on speeches, so long as MPs stay within the rules and avoid hesitation, deviation or repetition. They can keep on going unless the House votes to end debate - and the Chair won't allow a motion to do that until there had been sufficient debate, and the rule of thumb is that means 90 minutes per group of amendments. Then you need 100 MPs to vote to close the debate; that's why the Conservatives are on a three-line whip to attend today. The Conservative whips have cleared the decks for this bill.  ""I think the Conservative Party is wrong to be flirting with exit from the European Union,"" Mr Clegg told the BBC.  ""Hundreds of thousands, millions of jobs depend on our place in what is the world's largest borderless single market.""  Tory backbencher Mr Wharton agreed to propose the legislation after he came top in a ballot of MPs private members' bill and many Tories pushed for the referendum commitment to be made binding before the 2015 general election.  The bill has now reached its ""report stage"", where amendments can be discussed in detail. More than 50 amendments have been tabled, including 36 alone by Labour's Mike Gapes.  Mr Gapes, who spoke for about an hour, defended his approach, saying the bill as it stood was ""inadequate"" and required ""more proper consideration"".  His colleague Barry Sheerman said it was ""furtive and unseemly"" to have such an important constitutional matter considered via a private member's bill rather than through government legislation.  And Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was not present for the debate, said the bill was an exercise in the ""Conservative Party talking to itself"".  Mr Wharton told the BBC's Daily Politics his bill was making ""reasonable progress"" but acknowledged it was ""going to be slow going"".  He said Labour and Lib Dem opponents wanted to delay the bill so it ran out of parliamentary time, adding: ""We are going to do everything we can to stop that from happening"".  However, Conservative MP Adam Afriyie, has tabled an amendment calling for the referendum to happen in October next year instead - arguing that delaying a vote for four years will play into the hands of the UK Independence Party.  Speaking in the Commons, Mr Afriyie likened the promise of a referendum to a ""can that has been kicked down the road for generation after generation"" and urged MPs to ""settle the question now"".  ""I ask a simple question,"" he said. ""If not in this Parliament, when else can we be sure of securing a referendum...By chasing the EU referendum dream in 2017, we risk losing one in 2014 and throwing away the 2015 election.""  Asked about Mr Afriyie's amendment, Mr Wharton said: ""One Conservative MP has said 'I think perhaps we should look at a different date' and what we have found in recent months is that there is not a lot of support for that.""  Private members' bills normally have little chance of becoming law due to lack of parliamentary time, unless they are backed by the government.  But Mr Wharton's bill is being treated differently because David Cameron wants it to become law, to send a signal to his MPs and the public that he is serious about his commitment to hold a referendum.  Tory MPs are under a ""three line whip"" to support the bill but few are speaking in Friday's debate amid concerns that this would limit the time for discussion and play into the hands of the bill's opponents.  Foreign Secretary William Hague has written to all Conservatives to urge them to make their remarks ""short and pithy"".  If it looks like the legislation will be ""talked out"" by opponents giving long speeches, Mr Wharton can ask for a ""closure motion"". If backed by a majority of MPs, numbering at least 100, this would allow the bill to be voted on as a whole.  Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said Parliament was ""only doing its job"" by scrutinising the legislation, pointing out that the status of Gibraltar was highly significant and its omission from the bill was first raised by a Conservative.  However, he acknowledged that opponents of the bill would not do themselves any favours by tabling ""frivolous"" amendments and Parliament must focus on the substance of the benefits of UK membership.  UKIP, which has no representation in the Commons, urged MPs to back Mr Afriyie's call for the referendum to be brought forward.  ""I hope MPs do what's right, by voting to give the British people a say on the EU as soon as possible,"" the party's leader Nigel Farage said.  If it makes it through the Commons, it will go to the Lords for further discussion in the next few months."
15,"An aide to the former Taleban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, has revealed that he was sent to warn American diplomats and the United Nations that Osama bin Laden was due to launch a huge attack on American soil.  Neither organisation heeded the warning, which was given just weeks before the 11 September attacks.  The aide said he had urged the Americans to launch a military campaign against al-Qaeda but was told that this was politically impossible.  Mr Muttawakil, who was known to be deeply unhappy with the Arab and other foreign militants in Afghanistan, learned of Osama bin Laden's plan in July.  The attack was imminent, he discovered, and it would be huge. Bin Laden hoped to kill thousands of US citizens.  The information had come not from other members of the Taleban but from the leader of the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, Tohir Yuldash, who had found refuge in Afghanistan and had good links with al-Qaeda.  The minister was deeply worried that the US military would react with deadly vengeance against Afghanistan.  As he put it, al-Qaeda, the Taleban's guests, were going to destroy the guest house.  One of his former aides told me how he had been sent to issue warnings.  He went first to the American consulate in Peshawar in Pakistan, then to the United Nations. But neither warning was heeded.  One US official explained why:  ""We were hearing a lot of that kind of stuff,"" he said.  ""When people keep saying the sky's going to fall in, and it doesn't, a kind of 'warning fatigue' sets in.""  Another diplomatic source said he had thought the meeting was an attempt to rattle the US to please funders in the Gulf, a bid to raise money from al-Qaeda's donors.  And the fact that the aide had been told not to mention Mr Muttawakil's name also led to a downgrading of the information.  At the time, late July last year, 19 members of al-Qaeda were already in place in America, waiting to launch their deadly attacks.  It is already known that American domestic intelligence failed to heed information, but this is the only known alert that came from inside the Taleban movement.  The former foreign minister himself is now unavailable for comment - he handed himself in to the Afghan authorities in February.  He remains in US custody in Kandahar, one of the few senior Taleban whom America has managed to arrest."
16,"To their opponents they are ""yellow vultures"", perched on long poles, waiting to punish the innocent for travelling 2 mph over the speed limit.  But they are springing up all around the country as the authorities seek new ways to make people obey the speed limit.  The camera-haters, in this instance, can blame the IRA. Each average speed camera is in a pair. One camera - the entry camera - films your number plate as you enter a controlled zone and starts a timer. When you leave the zone, the exit camera films both your car and its number plate.  If there's a match with the entry camera, your speed is calculated, and if over the speed limit the evidence is passed on to the police.  Now its use as a more general crime-fighting tool and traffic control technique is spreading around the Western world.  The UK has a national network of ANPR allowing police to track car movements, most notably used to track the getaway car of the killers of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in 2005.  The average speed cameras - or Specs - are produced by Speed Check Services (SCS) in Camberley and are now installed temporarily at many roadworks sites and also permanently in many areas. The town with the most is Nottingham.  First used in 1999, each pair of Specs is allowed to be positioned any distance from 200m to 10km apart. In practice, most are a few hundred metres apart, says Paul Davey, managing director of SCS.  ""You do need to keep reminding people they are in a speed controlled zone. Too far apart and people forget.""  Also, placed further apart, people could speed up and slow down to keep their average below the limit, while still having broken the law.  But the critics have accused the cameras of allowing a less complicated dodge - changing lanes. Each pair of cameras covers one lane. So in theory, if you are clocked in the fast lane, and you then changed to the middle lane just before the exit camera, you would not be caught.  You might be picked up by entry camera A, speed down to camera B and change lane only to find that that was also an entry camera and that either exit cameras C or D would get you further down the road.  And the cameras slow more people down, Mr Davey suggests, producing a smoother traffic flow and avoiding the tiny go-slows around the old-fashioned spot speed cameras.  But Hugh Bladon, of the Association of British Drivers pressure group, says the new cameras still cause sudden braking by panicked drivers, but also now cause long stretches of crawling traffic.  ""People see a camera and immediately put their foot on the brakes,"" he says. ""It doesn't lead to good driving. You get people driving along and their eyes are glued to the speedometer rather than to the road.  ""In towns people who should be looking for children between the [parked] cars will be looking at their speedometers.""  I get fed up with people saying they have to stare at the speedometers to keep to the speed limit. Firstly, if you are a half decent driver you can tell when you are driving at 30mph. Secondly, glancing at the speedo should be a normal part of your driving, as well as checking your mirrors, which most of these people also seem incapable of doing  Steve, Preston UK  We have these on the A14. They do not solve the underlying problems of the area - too many lorries and inadequate roads.  Danie Jones, Cambridge, England  Alot of people do not concentrate enough on the road as it is, so supplying cameras casues random breaking and sudden lane switching as well as people not paying attention to anything other than speed which will ultimately lead to unsafe roads. ""Safety cameras"" are far from safe.  Simon, Milton Keynes  These things are a menace. Several times in recent weeks I have seen people panic braking on the M1 roadworks near junction 32, to the point where accidents have only been narrowly averted. I almost ran into the side of one car which suddenly ""outbraked"" me as I was changing lanes.  alan waldron, nottingham  I can't see the issue here, it is the same as traditional speed cameras, you break the speed limit you get fined if you don't break it then you are fine. What is the issue here?  Ian, Cardiff  These cameras have a major flaw. Who are the worst speeders on our roads ... Motorcycles. How do these cameras work... they photograph your front Licence plate. Do motorcycles have front licence plates ...... NO. Is it just me or is that crazy!  Allan, Camberley  I love these cameras. They face the oncoming traffic and so are utterly useless to stop me and other motorcyclists speeding whenever and wherever we wish.

17,"French authorities are formally investigating UBS for allegedly helping wealthy clients open undeclared bank accounts in Switzerland.  The Swiss bank is suspected of ""complicity in illegal sales practices"", an official at the Paris prosecutor's office told the BBC.  It also allegedly set up a shadow accounting system that masked transfers between French and Swiss bank accounts.  UBS said it was cooperating with authorities.  Under French law, being placed under official investigation means there is ""serious or consistent"" evidence to implicate a suspect in a crime. But it does not necessarily lead to a trial, the official said.  The latest move follows action taken against the bank's French unit last week which was also formally placed under scrutiny on similar suspicions.  The former head of UBS France, Patrick de Fayet, and two other local branch executives are already being investigated.  Investigators are examining whether UBS staff broke a French law against ""illicit solicitation"" by actively approaching potential clients in France.  The allegations originally came to light after former staff blew the whistle on the practices that involved hundreds of retail and corporate clients.  An anonymous letter was reportedly sent to the regulatory arm of the French central bank suggesting that parallel accounts were opened in Switzerland but undeclared in France, which is illegal under French law.  The letter said a special record was kept between 2002-2007 listing undeclared bank accounts that had been opened by corporate clients.  According to French daily Le Monde citing former employees, UBS bankers regularly mingled with affluent people at sporting events and musical concerts - including some sponsored by UBS - in order to seek out possible clients for tax evasion.  In one example, a former marketing official at the French branch of UBS said Swiss bankers ""made trips [to France] to meet 'prospects'"" at events, including the tennis tournament Roland Garros.  Stephanie Gibaud said she was asked to ""destroy a series of sensitive documents containing the names of current or potential clients who had participated in events organised on French territory.""  Nicolas Forissier, a former internal auditor of UBS' private banking division, also told the newspaper that a special record containing a list of French clients with undeclared bank accounts was sent to the UBS' Swiss headquarters.  ""It was France that you had to milk. The French branch of UBS was just an excuse to collect [clients] for UBS Switzerland,"" he told Le Monde.  The magistrates investigating the affair have sent a list containing the names of 353 people suspected of having held a Swiss account to Swiss authorities and have requested details, the official at the prosecutor's office told the BBC.  In addition to the latest investigation, UBS was also identified as a ""supervised witness"" on two other allegations related to money laundering and tax evasion, she added.  Supervised witness is a less serious status than a formal investigation. It means that a person must be accompanied by his or her lawyer if questioned further in the investigation.  UBS said: ""We will continue working with the authorities in France within the applicable legal framework to arrive at a resolution to this matter.""  In a separate statement in French, it said: ""The tribunal's decision widens the probe. UBS will continue to cooperate with the French authorities. UBS will not allow any move aimed at helping clients to avoid their fiscal duties.""  The latest investigation came amid a wider government crackdown on tax evasion in Europe and the United States.  In France, former French budget minister Jerome Cahuzac resigned in April after admitting he had squirreled away savings in an undeclared Swiss bank account. His ministry was responsible for tackling tax evasion.  UBS was placed under a similar investigation in 2008 in the US when it faced charges for conspiracy to defraud the US tax authority. The bank eventually paid a $780m fine to avoid prosecution and handed over data on some 4,500 bank accounts held by suspected US tax evaders."

19,"Libya, a mostly desert and oil-rich country with an ancient history, has more recently been known for the 42-year rule of the mercurial Col Muammar Gaddafi - and the chaos that followed his departure.  Libya was under foreign rule for centuries until it gained independence in 1951. Soon after oil was discovered and earned the country immense wealth.  Col Gaddafi seized power in 1969 and ruled for four decades until he was toppled in 2011 following an armed rebellion assisted by Western military intervention.  In recent years the country has been a key springboard for migrants heading for Europe. Concerns have also been raised over the rise of Islamist militancy there.  The toppling of long-term leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control.  The National Transitional Council (NTC), a rebel leadership council which had fought to oust the Gaddafi government, declared Libya ''liberated'' in October 2011 and took over the running of the country.  However, it struggled to impose order on the many armed militia that had become active in the months leading up to the ouster of Gaddafi.  In August 2012 the NTC handed power to the General National Congress (GNC), an elected parliament which went on to select an interim head of state.  Voters chose a new parliament to replace the GNC in June 2014 - the Council of Representatives (CoR), which relocated to the eastern city of Tobruk, leaving Tripoli controlled by powerful militia groups.  The Islamic State extremist militia took advantage of the conflict between forces loyal to the outgoing GNC and the new parliament to gain control of several coastal cities, including Derna and Sirte.  Late in 2015, the UN brokered an agreement to form a new ""unity"" government - the Presidency Council, headed by unity Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj - but both Tripoli and Tobruk administrations were reluctant to acknowledge its authority.  Mr Sarraj and some of his deputies finally arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 and set up their headquarters in a heavily-guarded naval base.  Libya's media environment is highly-polarised and virtually unregulated, reflecting the country's political instability.  Satellite TV is a key news source and many outlets are based outside Libya.  Journalism is fraught with danger; reporters face threats and attacks.  Islamic State group operates its own media from its stronghold, Sirte.  7th century BC - Phoenicians settle in Tripolitania in western Libya, which was hitherto populated by Berbers.  4th century BC - Greeks colonise Cyrenaica in the east of the country, which they call Libya.  16th century - Libya becomes part of the Ottoman Empire, which joins the three provinces of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan into one regency in Tripoli.  1911-12 - Italy seizes Libya from the Ottomans. Omar al-Mukhtar begins 20-year insurgency against Italian rule.  1942 - Allies oust Italians from Libya, which is then divided between the French and the British.  1992 - UN imposes sanctions on Libya over the bombing of a PanAm airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988.  2011 - Violent protests break out in Benghazi and spread to other cities. This leads to civil war, foreign intervention and eventually the ouster and killing of Gaddafi.  2016 - Following years of conflict, a new UN-backed ""unity"" government is installed in a naval base in Tripoli. It faces opposition from two rival governments and a host of militias."
20,"   During the next few years, Engels continued his political journey. He met with Marx again in 1844. From that day a lifelong friendship and unity of purpose began. They wrote and published the ’Communist Manifesto’ together in 1848. During the summer of 1845, both Engels and Marx visited Manchester. Engels took Mary back to the continent with him and they were never separated again.     Engels returned to Manchester in November 1850. Again he came to work for the family firm. There were several reasons for this. One of which was to avoid possible arrest for his involvement in the uprisings in Germany during 1848 and 1849. Another though was in order to finance the work of Marx.     It was felt that Marx needed to devote all his time to researching and writing Das Kapital. Therefore someone would have to support him financially if he was to achieve this. Engels decided that he would have to do so. He did not do this purely out of friendship, although the bond between the two men was now very strong. He believed that Marx had the superior analytical mind and was therefore better suited to task of writing and researching what was to become Das Kapital.     Again Engels returned to the double life. On the overt side he was living as a respected businessman and leading figure of the Manchester German community. He was a member of the Albert club and Shiller-Anstalt, of which he became president in 1864, and participated in the Cheshire Hunt. He often entertained the ‘philistines’, as he described them, at his official lodgings. These society and business associates knew nothing of his great intellectual abilities. On the covert side he shared his unofficial home with Mary Burns, her sister Lizzie (Lydia) and her niece. Following Mary’s death Lizzie became Engels ‘wife’. Here he met with those who shared his communist and revolutionary convictions. He adopted secretive methods in order to keep these two lives separate.     Words: Danny Crosby                  "
21,"Under the ""Volkswagen Law"" any shareholder in VW could not exercise more than 20% of voting rights, even if their stake in the firm was bigger.  The European Court of Justice said the law discouraged foreign investors from taking a stake in Volkswagen.  Porsche, which owns 31% of VW, declined to say whether it would now move to take control of its compatriot.  While some analysts have long believed that Porsche wants to take full control of VW, the luxury carmaker said following the court verdict that there was currently ""no decision on how we will proceed"".  A Porsche spokesman added that any decision regarding its stake in VW would be made by its board members, but that it was not yet known if any decision will be made at their next meeting on 12 November.  For the time being, Porsche chief executive Wendelin Wiedeking said his company was ""naturally very interested in being able to fully exert our voting rights"" in VW.  Porsche has already said that it has secured enough options to let it ""significantly"" raise its stake in VW.  The European Court of Justice also rejected the right of the German government to appoint members to the VW board.  The federal government has said that it will move quickly to change the law.  ""We regret that the court did not recognise our good arguments about protecting Germany as a business location,"" a Justice Ministry spokesman said.  The German state of Lower Saxony, VW's second largest shareholder, with a 20.3% stake, said it ""accepts the decision"" of the court and will retain its stake."
22,"Did World War One actually improve women's lives in Britain? At the time, many people believed that the war had helped advance women politically and economically. Thus, Mrs Millicent Fawcett, leading feminist, founder of Newnham College Cambridge and president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies from 1897 to 1918, said in 1918: 'The war revolutionised the industrial position of women - it found them serfs and left them free.' The war did offer women increased opportunities in the paid labour market. Between 1914 and 1918, an estimated two million women replaced men in employment, resulting in an increase in the proportion of women in total employment from 24 per cent in July 1914 to 37 per cent by November 1918. ...wages were higher, conditions better, and independence enhanced. The war bestowed two valuable legacies on women. First, it opened up a wider range of occupations to female workers and hastened the collapse of traditional women's employment, particularly domestic service. From the 19th century to 1911, between 11 and 13 per cent of the female population in England and Wales were domestic servants. By 1931, the percentage had dropped to under eight per cent. For the middle classes, the decline of domestic servants was facilitated by the rise of domestic appliances, such as cookers, electric irons and vacuum cleaners. The popularity of 'labour-saving devices' does not, however, explain the dramatic drop in the servant population. Middle-class women continued to clamour for servants, but working women who might previously have been enticed into service were being drawn away by alternative employment opening up to satisfy the demands of war. Thus, nearly half of the first recruits to the London General Omnibus Company in 1916 were former domestic servants. Clerical work was another draw card. The number of women in the Civil Service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to 102,000 by 1921. The advantages of these alternative employments over domestic service were obvious: wages were higher, conditions better, and independence enhanced.  Trade unionism proved to be the second legacy of the war. Female workers had been less unionised than their male counterparts. This was because they tended to do part-time work and to work in smaller firms (which tended to be less unionised). Also, existing unions were often hostile to female workers. World War One forced unions to deal with the issue of women's work. The scale of women's employment could no longer be denied and rising levels of women left unmarried or widowed by the war forced the hands of the established unions. Employers circumvented wartime equal pay regulations by employing several women to replace one man... In addition, feminist pressure on established unions and the formation of separate women's unions threatened to destabilise men-only unions. The increase in female trade union membership from only 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918 represented an increase in the number of unionised women of 160 per cent. This compares with an increase in the union membership of men of only 44 per cent. However, the war did not inflate women's wages. Employers circumvented wartime equal pay regulations by employing several women to replace one man, or by dividing skilled tasks into several less skilled stages. In these ways, women could be employed at a lower wage and not said to be 'replacing' a man directly. By 1931, a working woman's weekly wage had returned to the pre-war situation of being half the male rate in more industries.  Anxiety for their menfolk in war, the pressures of employment, combined with the need to perform housework in straitened circumstances and the inadequacy of social services exacted a heavy toll. It also made the withdrawal of women back into their homes after the war less surprising. This return to full-time domesticity was not, however, wholly voluntary. In many instances, contracts of employment during World War One had been based on collective agreements between trade unions and employers, which decreed that women would only be employed 'for the duration of the war'. Employed mothers were stung by the closure of day nurseries that had been vastly extended during the war. Reinforcing these pressures were the recriminatory voices of returning servicemen. As unemployment levels soared immediately after the war, anger towards women 'taking' jobs from men exploded. As unemployment levels soared immediately after the war, anger towards women 'taking' jobs from men exploded. Women were also divided, with single and widowed women claiming a prior right to employment over married women. For instance, Isobel M Pazzey of Woolwich reflected a widely-held view when she wrote to the Daily Herald in October 1919 declaring that 'No decent man would allow his wife to work, and no decent woman would do it if she knew the harm she was doing to the widows and single girls who are looking for work.' She directed: 'Put the married women out, send them home to clean their houses and look after the man they married and give a mother's care to their children. Give the single women and widows the work.' In some occupations, single women insisted on excluding their married sisters. For instance, in 1921, female civil servants passed a resolution asking for the banning of married women from their jobs. The resulting ban was enforced until 1946. There were other setbacks. During World War One, hospitals had accepted female medical students: in the 1920s, women were rejected by the hospitals on the grounds of modesty. The National Association of Schoolmasters campaigned against the employment of female teachers. In 1924, the London County Council make its policy explicit when it changed the phrase 'shall resign on marriage' to 'the contract shall end on marriage'.  Finally, some historians believe that the war was a key element in the granting of the franchise to women over the age of 30 years who held property in 1918. However, gratitude for women's war work cannot explain why only women over the age of 30 got the vote while it was the younger women who had done the work. Rather, it is more convincing to argue that the lobbying of the feminist movement and the commitment of the Labour Party to a wider franchise were crucial factors. In addition, it was a case of the suffragists being around at the right time. ...it was a case of the suffragists being around at the right time. In 1917, the government became aware of the need to call an election. The problem was that, according to the law, only men who had been resident in the country for 12 months prior to the election were entitled to vote, effectively disenfranchising a large number of troops who had been serving overseas. This dilemma forced Parliament to revise the franchise. At this point, the arguments of Millicent Fawcett and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies proved particularly persuasive and, by drawing attention to the work of women during the war, persuaded the Liberal leader, Asquith, to grant a minority of women the vote. But it was not until 1928 that women over the age of 21 were finally allowed to vote. In effect, this meant that in 1918, 8.5 million women were enfranchised, or 40 per cent of the total number of women. In 1928, this was boosted to 15 million, or 53 per cent of total number of women.

23,"The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court A newspaper group is paying £550,000 to the parents of Madeleine McCann after it settled a libel case over reports of her disappearance. Express Newspapers' titles, including the Daily Express, Daily Star and Sunday Express, are also printing front-page apologies. They say they were wrong to suggest the couple, of Rothley, Leicestershire, were responsible for Madeleine's death. The McCanns say the money will go to the Find Madeleine campaign. In a statement read out on behalf of the McCanns at the High Court on Wednesday, they said they were pleased that Express Newspapers had admitted the ""utter falsity"" of the numerous stories written about them over many months. Their spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, added that the allegations had caused them ""great distress"". It is understood that the sum donated to the campaign doubles the amount left in the fund. Madeleine disappeared, days before her fourth birthday, during a family holiday in the resort of Praia da Luz, in the Algarve, on 3 May last year. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, have been named as suspects in the case by Portuguese police but have always denied any involvement. Madeleine McCann went missing in Portugal in May 2007 The settlement was confirmed at a High Court hearing, although the amount of damages was not formally disclosed. It came after Wednesday's editions of the Daily Express and Daily Star both carried front-page apologies under the headline, ""Kate and Gerry McCann: Sorry"". The Express said it accepted that a ""number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up"". It also acknowledged there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support that theory. The paper added that Mr and Mrs McCann are ""completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance"". The Star said it was making a ""wholehearted apology to Kate and Gerry McCann for stories suggesting the couple were responsible for, or may be responsible for, the death of their daughter Madeleine and for covering it up"". Further apologies are expected in the publications' sister Sunday titles at the weekend. The libel action related to more than 100 stories across the four titles, including 42 printed in the Daily Express. I think this is an amazing stand-down, u-turn, by the Express newspapers    All four titles are published by the Express Newspapers group, which has agreed to all the McCanns' requests. It is also paying all their costs. A spokesman for the company said: ""We have nothing to add to what will be said in court and in our titles."" The McCanns' lawyers said that some of the newspapers' articles were ""grossly defamatory"". Richard Bilton, BBC News special correspondent, said one of the couple's representatives had said the response of the newspaper group was ""much more responsible than they were perhaps initially with these articles"". Media commentator Roy Greenslade said that for two national newspapers to carry front-page apologies at the same time was ""unprecedented"". ""I think this is an amazing stand-down, U-turn, by the Express newspapers,"" he said. The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court ""I think when people realise that more than 100 stories have been complained about as being grossly defamatory, it will annihilate the Express' readers sense of trust and credibility in their newspaper."" Media lawyer Paul Gilbert, from Finers Stephens Innocent, said the courts encourage early settlement of defamation cases. ""Clearly the Express' lawyers felt this was a case they should settle without a high-profile trial - which it would be - and as a result have saved considerable costs,"" he said. ""It certainly is a warning sign to newspapers in the future - if they're going to speculate, they've got to be very careful about what they speculate about."""
24,"Up to 80 jobs will be lost as the Cardiff International Airport-based company moves to charter flights and freight transport only.  It blamed the move on ""spiralling costs"" and ""aggressive competition"" from larger low-cost airlines.  Three airlines are expected to take over routes to destinations including Aberdeen, Cork and Manchester.  The news came as ferry operator Stena Line announced it was cutting sailings between Holyhead and Ireland, also blaming budget airlines and rising fuel costs.  In a statement, Air Wales said it was becoming ""increasingly impossible for independent regional airlines such as Air Wales to operate profitably without substantial subsidy"".  Air Wales currently flies to 10 destinations from Cardiff and a number of others from bases in France, Manchester and Ireland.  The company is holding discussions with other carriers over handing on its routes to them.  Three have been announced already, with Aer Arann flying Cardiff to Cork, Eastern Airlines taking over Brussels, Aberdeen and Newcastle services and Air Southwest flying to Manchester and Newquay.  Just last month, it re-launched the service linking Cardiff with Brussels, with Welsh assembly government support.  An assembly government source said the money was awarded to the airport rather than the airline, so it had not been lost but would need to be taken over by another airline.  It is also hoped that staff losing their jobs will be offered posts with the companies taking over the routes.  Air Wales chairman Roy Thomas said they had made the decision ""with sadness and regret"".  ""Increased costs and high competition in the market place have made it virtually impossible to exist as a passenger focused airline,"" he said.  ""Without the vast economies of scale required to sustain and successfully compete in the passenger airline business today, it has become clear that Air Wales now needs to centre on charter and freight services to continue operating in the airline industry.""  He added all passengers booked with the airline after 23 April would get a full refund and help finding alternative flights.  Assembly Economic Development Minister Andrew Davies said he was ""disappointed"" to hear the decision but delighted three airlines had come forward to take over some routes.  The airline began operating in November 1999, flying from Cardiff International Airport and Pembrey in west Wales to London, before expanding to Cork and other routes.  Cardiff International Airport's managing director Jon Horne said: ""We are sad to learn that Air Wales is to cease scheduled operations and hope that the impact on jobs can be minimised.  ""Meanwhile, other airlines are preparing to announce scheduled operations from Cardiff International on routes that Air Wales will be giving up.""  The announcement of the end of scheduled services came hours after Stena Line ferries announced it was cutting back fast ferry services between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire, near Dublin.  Dr Anthony Beresford, a lecturer in transport in the Cardiff Business School said the ferry companies faced long winters and ""peaky"" sailing times.  He said: ""Fuel costs are high yes, but they would be better off running smaller ships. The problem they've got is that they have very large vessels which are very thirsty to run.  ""The impact of this is that if you cut the frequency, it is directly going to tend to push jobs into the part-time and informal sector"".  Dr Beresford said the rising cost of fuel being blamed for the airline cuts was ""quite frankly a red herring because other airlines are experiencing the same problem"".  He added: ""Yes, there is competition from other airlines, but the main competition budget airlines face [within the UK] is from people driving to their destination."""
25,"A mountainous semi-autonomous region of Georgia, Ajaria is situated on the Black Sea coast on Georgia's southwestern border with Turkey. Its narrow band of coastal lowland has a lush sub-tropical climate while high in the mountains there can be snow for six months of the year. The port in the capital, Batumi, is used for the shipment of oil from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Its oil refinery handles Caspian oil from Azerbaijan which arrives by pipeline to Supsa port and is transported from there to Batumi by rail. Batumi is also an important gateway for the shipment of goods heading into Georgia, Azerbaijan and landlocked Armenia. The Ajarian capital is a centre for shipbuilding and manufacturing. Ajaria has good land for growing tea, citrus fruits and tobacco. The people of Ajaria are overwhelmingly Georgians. Under Ottoman rule from the 17th until the 19th century Islam predominated. The word Ajarian came to mean a Georgian Muslim. Tensions erupt on the internal border between Georgia and Ajaria In 1878 Ajaria was annexed by Russia and, following the Bolshevik revolution, incorporated into Georgia as an autonomous republic within the USSR. Under Stalin, Islam, like Christianity, was ruthlessly repressed. Nowadays over 60% of the population are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and about 30% continue to profess Islam. Unlike the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Ajaria has been spared major violence and ethnic unrest since Georgia became independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The region was led between 1991 and May 2004 by Aslan Abashidze, who maintained close ties with Moscow. Election results gave him at least 90% of the vote every time and he ruled in an autocratic style. Former Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze stepped down and fled After Eduard Shevardnadze was overthrown as Georgian president and the results of the November 2003 Georgian parliamentary elections were annulled, a state of emergency was declared in Ajaria. Its leadership refused to recognise the full authority of Mikhail Saakashvili as Georgian president. In May 2004, Mr Abashidze claimed that Georgian forces were preparing to invade. His own forces blew up bridges connecting the region with the rest of Georgia. Mr Saakashvili ordered the Ajarian leader to comply with the Georgian constitution and start disarming or face removal. Large numbers of demonstrators took to the streets of Batumi. In an echo of events in Tbilisi the previous autumn, Mr Abashidze resigned. Levan Varshalomidze, a close ally of President Saakashvili, took over as head of government. Russia then agreed to close its military base at Batumi in 2007. The base was a source of great tension between Moscow and Georgia. As a sign of Ajaria's reconnection with the central Georgian government the Constitutional Court was moved from Tbilisi to Batumi the same year. When former autocratic leader Aslan Abashidze left the country following a showdown with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, his post was abolished. In subsequent elections to the Ajarian assembly Mr Saakashvili's party won 28 of the 30 seats. Their campaign promises included working to improve living standards and stamp out corruption. There were allegations of vote-rigging from Mr Saakashvili's former allies, the Republican Party, after they won less than 15 per cent of the vote. Legislation passed by the Georgian parliament after the elections gives the assembly powers over local affairs. It states that the head of the region's government is nominated by the Georgian president, who also has powers to dissolve the assembly and government and to overrule the local authorities in the event of contravention of the Georgian constitution. Since 2004 an ally of President Saakashvili, Levan Varshalomidze, has been chairman of the regional council of ministers. The Ajarian authorities operate TV and radio networks in the region.     "
26,"Paraguay's Jose Luis Chilavert has again come to the defence of national coach Cesare Maldini.  The Italian was heavily criticised following the team's 4-0 defeat against England.  But the unpredictable goalkeeper has turned the tables, rounding on the supporters who had abused Maldini on his return from the match.  And Chilavert also described 90% of the press as ""incompetent"".  ""I would like to apologise to 'professor' Maldini for the unacceptable behaviour of the fans,"" the 31-year-old told Paraguayan radio station Nanduti  ""They should let us get on with our preparations and if things go badly then they can feel free to criticise us,"" he added.  Chilavert also wants the press to judge Maldini and the team on their showing in the Far East.  ""About 90% of sports journalists in Paraguay are incompetent.  ""The young Paraguayan journalists must change the mentality and direction of sports journalism and not follow the same path as the older generation.  ""The latter bunch are mediocre and will never be able to rise above that level,"" he concluded."
27,"Nine Australians arrested for stripping off at the Malaysian Formula One Grand Prix have walked free from a court.  The group, branded the ""Budgie Nine"", were charged with public nuisance, which carries a fine but no jail time.  The men were detained after posing in swimwear decorated with the Malaysian flag to celebrate Australian Daniel Ricciardo's win in Sunday's race.  In a letter read out in court, they apologised and expressed their ""deepest regret"".  They said the incident was ""purely an error of judgement"" on their behalf.  Budgie is the abbreviated name of the budgerigar, a small Australian parrot, and budgie-smuggler is a slang term for tight swimming trunks worn by men.  Among the men was Jack Walker, an aide to Australian Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne.  His father John Walker addressed the media outside the court after the hearing, saying that his son and the other eight were ""good boys"".  One of the men, Thomas Whitworth, fainted during the proceedings and had to be given water.  Many Australians took to social media to express anger and embarrassment at the men's antics, while others saw their actions as nothing more than foolish hijinks.  Earlier, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Nine Network that what may be seen as a foolish prank in Australia could be viewed very differently in other countries.  ""I don't know that it will be seen as a lapse of judgment,"" she said. ""It was clearly premeditated. They were wearing the budgie smugglers and had bought them in Australia.""  Malaysia has strict rules on any display of public indecency and foreign offenders are typically issued a fine before being deported.  Last year four foreign tourists were jailed for taking naked photographs at the peak of Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia.  The maximum fine for public nuisance is RM400 (£76; $96). It was not immediately clear what the men will have to pay.  Their lawyer, Shafie Abdullah, had argued that his clients were part-time lifeguards, so stripping down came quite naturally to them.  A spokesperson from Budgy Smuggler, the swimwear company behind the swimwear, said it would not produce the Malaysian flag design again.  ""We've produced for about 50 countries around the world and this is the first time it's caused an international incident,"" Jarrod Allen, head of research and development, told the BBC.  ""We'd never set out to intentionally disrespect."""
28,"British actor Mackenzie Crook, best known for playing Gareth in The Office, has been shortlisted for this year's Waterstones Children's Book Prize.  The 40-year-old received the nomination for his debut novel, The Windvale Sprites, which he also illustrated.  Crook was nominated in the five to 12-year-old category. The two other prizes are for picture and teen books.  Each winner will receive £2,000 on 28 March, with an overall winner getting a further £3,000.  Previous winners have also seen a significant boost in sales of their books.  Jonny Duddle, the concept artist for Aardman film The Pirates!, which is out this March, has been shortlisted in the picture category.  His book, The Pirates Next Door, will compete against No! by Marta Altes; I Don't Want To Be A Pea! by Ann Bonwill and Simon Rickerty; Chris Haughton's A Bit Lost; I Want My Hat Back by Jon Klassen; and Nadia Shireen's Good Little Wolf.  Phil Earle's gritty novel Being Billy, about children in care, was shortlisted in the teen category.  Annabel Pitcher's My Sister Lives on the Mantelpiece; Divergent by Veronica Roth; Jenny Downham's You Against Me; Amy and Roger's Epic Detour by Morgan Matson; and Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys completed the list.  Crook's book will compete against Janet Foxley's Muncle Trogg; Sky Hawk by Gill; The Brilliant World of Tom Gates by L Pichon; Alan Silberberg's Milo and the Restart Button; and Claude in the City by Alex T Smith.  Now in its eighth year, the prize was created to ""reward and champion new and emerging talent in children's writing"".  The winners are determined by booksellers across the country.  It is open to authors writing for children from seven to 13 and who have written no more than two fiction titles.  Sita Brahmachari was presented with the top prize last year for her debut novel Artichoke Hearts."
29,"It is Africa's largest country. It has more pyramids than Egypt. But Sudan is not in the headlines for its heritage.  A new exhibit of ancient Sudanese artefacts at the British Museum in London is hoping to go some way to change this.  ""Sudan is not well known in the West, and unfortunately if it is known, it's only for very bad things. Now is an opportunity to show another face of the Sudan - one of civilisation.""  As director of fieldwork for the national museum in Khartoum, Dr Saleh Mohammed Ahmed is familiar with the treasures loaned to the British Museum.  When the show was first mooted five years ago, it was hoped it might mark the signing of a peace treaty ending the civil war.  Instead, the news is full of the crisis in Darfur, while some of the country's most exciting archaeological sites are about to disappear under a dam project.  And a few months ago, the Khartoum museum was robbed of dozens of major pieces.  In various ways, the show at the British Museum sheds light on each of these issues.  Curator Derek Welsby points out a big white bone at the entrance to the gallery.  It is a fossil giraffe bone, next to a picture of where it was found in the arid moonscape of the Sudanese desert.  ""What this shows us is that once upon a time, what is now one of the most arid places on the planet had a population of big game with people fishing and hunting,"" he says.  ""You can see how fluid the climate is, and how this causes all sorts of problems to present-day populations as it did to people in the past.""  This lends a sobering historical perspective to the struggles over land occupation in Darfur, but elsewhere in the gallery there is more hopeful evidence of a history of mutual tolerance between Sudan's ethnic and religious groups.  By the 10th Century, there were three Christian kingdoms in the area, and on display is a jeweller's mould found in a Christian site and used for casting Koranic inscriptions.  ""We've got Christian sites where there are clearly Muslims living as part of the resident population. We have Muslim tombstones found adjacent to ones inscribed in Greek, old Nubian and Coptic, for example.""  One of the least-known areas of Sudan is the inhospitable region round the fourth cataract of the Nile.  This area is about to flooded by a 160km-long (100 mile) lake for a hydroelectric dam.  Just as 40 years ago when the temples at Abu Simbel in Egypt were threatened by the Aswan dam, rescue archaeologists are hard at work.  And they are finding astonishing riches in the dry, termite-free area they thought was empty of artefacts.  ""We are rewriting the history of Sudan, finding materials from all periods,"" says Dr Saleh.  They have discovered fortresses, cities, cemeteries and even a pyramid where they thought there was nothing.  And its all about to be obliterated.  Neil Macgregor, director of the British Museum, hopes the exhibition will alert the world to this archaeological race against time, but he is mindful of other priorities, too.  The British Museum is waiving its entry fee in place of a suggested donation to relief charities in Darfur.  ""Whatever happens politically, it's going to be more important than ever to understand what this country is about. That's what this exhibition is for.""  As in the cases of Iraq and Iran, the international community of archaeologists and scholars is working to keep lines of communication open during politically difficult times.  And the pieces stolen from Khartoum?  Fifty-seven of them were recovered two weeks ago in Omdurman, just outside Khartoum, safe and intact.  Some good news at least from Sudan, at a time when it is in short supply."
30,"As the world mourns the passing of the ""Greatest"", in the pubs around Dublin the locals will be retelling old yarns of the week more than 40 years ago, when Ireland was in thrall to the magic of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was arguably the greatest fighter who ever lived.  He was blessed with an irresistible mix of speed, skill, charisma, intelligence and courage.  But he was always far more than simply a fighter - he transcended sport.  The ""Rumble in the Jungle"", the ""Thrilla in Manila"" - Muhammad Ali was involved in some of the most iconic fights in boxing history, overcoming greats of the ring including George Foreman and Joe Frazier.  While it is fair to say that Ali v Al 'Blue' Lewis at Croke Park, Dublin, may not roll off the tongue like those historic bouts, the legend of Ali's visit to Ireland in 1972 grows with each passing year.  After losing to Joe Frazier in March 1971, Ali went on something of a world tour, fighting 13 times in six countries before defeating Frazier in a rematch in January 1974.  The promotion was the brainchild of a character from Kerry named Butty Sugrue, as Cork-born author Dave Hannigan explained.  ""Butty Sugrue was known throughout Ireland as a circus strongman, whose alleged claim to fame was pulling double-decker buses by a rope in his teeth, he was also a publican in London,"" he said.  ""It was his idea to bring Ali to Croke Park and it was so outlandish a notion that the Dublin journalists laughed at him when he first announced his intention,"" said Hannigan, who wrote the book The Big Fight, which chronicles Ali's visit to Ireland.  But despite the scepticism, the fight was arranged for 19 July 1972. As soon as he got off the plane at Dublin Airport, Ali, ever the showman, immediately captured the heart of a nation by announcing that he had Irish roots.  Between 1850 and 1880, 100,000 people left Ireland for north America. One such emigrant was Abe Grady who left his native Ennis in County Clare sometime in the 1860s. In Kentucky, he met and married an emancipated slave. A century later Abe Grady's great grandson Muhammad Ali touched down in Dublin.  In the week leading up to the fight, as was typical of the man, Ali met people from all walks of life in Dublin.  He spent time with celebrities, including actor Peter O'Toole and playfully sparred with director John Huston, whose boxing movie, Fat City, was screened with both Ali and Lewis in attendance.  He also met politicians, including Taoiseach Jack Lynch in Leinster House, and political activist Bernadette Devlin.  The Cork Examiner newspaper commented on how popular Ali had proven with politicians in Ireland.  ""Not since the late President John F Kennedy was in Dublin in 1963 has a visitor from abroad been given as big a welcome at Leinster House as that accorded to Muhammad Ali,"" the newspaper said.  As the tales continued to grow of Ali's week in Ireland, it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction.  There are a number of stories about him spending time with everyday people, stopping in for tea with an elderly lady and having a lengthy chat with a road sweeper outside Croke Park.  A meeting was also arranged between Ali and one of Ireland's leading sportsmen, hurler Eddie Keher, who gave him a tutorial in hurling.  Keher later reflected on the difference in Ali's private and public persona.  ""He was a hero of mine,"" Keher said, ""but I was surprised how quiet he was until we met with the press.""  Ali recorded an advertisement for the Irish tourist board extolling the virtues of the Emerald Isle, but remarking on ""how rough"" hurling and Gaelic football were, and so he thought he would stick to boxing!  Ali had an innate ability to empathise with people wherever he found himself.  This empathy was in evidence during a memorable interview he gave that week to RTE's Cathal O'Shannon, comparing the Troubles in Northern Ireland with the US civil-rights struggle.  The interview caused a stir in America as Dave Hannigan explained: ""What was interesting to me is that some of the American hacks at the time tried to paint a picture that Ali's presence in Dublin brought peace to the north for a week!  ""The truth is it was one of the bloodiest weeks ever in Northern Ireland. But, in newspaper interviews and in the recollections of those around him, Ali was very aware of the situation in Northern Ireland and what was going on there.""  For Hannigan, the social impact of the visit was encapsulated in one encounter in Dublin's O'Connell Street.  ""He was walking down O'Connell Street in Dublin with groups of kids following him chanting 'Ali! Ali! Ali!'  ""At a time when Dublin was one of the whitest cities in Europe, this icon comes along and is welcomed so warmly that some in Ali's entourage say that the reception he received compared only to two other places - Atlanta and Harlem!""  Muhammad Ali was always about so much more than boxing, and that week in Dublin was another case in point, as the fight itself was not a classic.  Ali had a cold and was wary of Lewis, who was a dangerous fighter (and a man who had previously served time in prison for manslaughter). Ali who, prior to the bout had predicted that his opponent's chances of victory lay somewhere between ""slim and none"", eventually won with a TKO in round 11.  In 2009, Ali returned to Ireland to visit Ennis in County Clare, the home town of his ancestor Abe Grady, where he was granted the freedom of the town.  The huge crowds who came out to meet him were testament to his enduring appeal.  But the magic of Muhammad Ali left an indelible impact on Ireland after his 1972 visit as the late Budd Schulberg, a legendary boxing writer, said.  ""Ali was like the Pied Piper. It was really kind of magical. He had enormous influence over there. He was a fellow Irishman."""

Jamie Smith restored the lead after a strong run and cross by Chris Clark.  But Tim Cahill turned in an Anichebe cross and the provider turned match winner from a Phil Neville delivery.  About 10,000 fans turned out to mark Scotland defender Anderson's decade at the club."
32,"Fifa suspended Kenya from international football on Wednesday for failing to respect signed agreements to resolve the recurrent problems in the country's federation.  According to a statement from the game's governing body, the suspension will be in force until the agreements reached have been fully implemented.  Fifa's Emergency Committee took the decision following a recommendation from their committee for national associations after the Kenya Football Federation (KFF) failed to respect a 28-point agreement signed in January.  ""The Emergency Committee has approved the proposal made on 18 October by the Fifa Associations Committee to suspend the KFF,"" the Fifa statement said.  ""Fifa's statutes, regulations and decisions have been regularly violated or ignored by members of the Kenyan football family.  ""The suspension will be in force until the agreements reached have been fully implemented.""  The KFF incurred Fifa's wrath for failing to put a number of measures in place by a deadline of Wednesday 18 October.  One stand-out problem was the presence of two separate elite leagues within the country, which directly opposed Fifa's desires.  Fifa wanted Kenya Premier League Limited (KPL) to run a league featuring 18 clubs but the KFF set up a company, KFF PL, to run a 20-team league.  A meeting was held between the rival bodies on 2 October and a unified league was to start two weeks later.  Yet both sides then came up with parallel fixtures which ended with a farcical situation at the weekend when one team was scheduled to play two different matches on the same day in the two different leagues.  At a high-level meeting involving officials from Fifa, KFF and the Kenyan government in Cairo in January, a 28-point roadmap to safeguard the East African nation's football was signed.  Yet KFF officials failed to implement all the points, one reason why the Emergency Committee has approved the country's suspension.  It is the second ban in two years for the east African nation.  Fifa suspended Kenya for three months in 2004 for government interference but the situation was reversed after the country accepted to draw up new statutes."
33,"A cross-party group of political big-wigs, including many senior members of the House of Lords, is calling on Prime Minister David Cameron to stop creating new peers.  Mr Cameron has created 117 new members of the Lords since becoming prime minister last May, a faster rate of elevation than any PM in British history.  What is more, this expansion has occurred at the same time his government has legislated to reduce the size of the House of Commons by 50 members, from 650 to 600.  The group, who have put their names to a pamphlet called ""House Full"" published by the Constitution Unit at University College, London, includes the former cabinet secretary Lord (Robin) Butler, the former lord chancellor, Lord Mackay, the former Commons speaker Baroness (Betty) Boothroyd, the former lord chief justice Lord Woolf and Lord Stevenson, who used to chair the Lords Appointments Commission.  Other supporters include David Steel, Margaret Jay and Michael Forsyth, who are also peers.  The Lords now has 831 members, though only 792 are currently entitled to attend and vote. These figures are far greater than at any time since the reforms of 1999 when most hereditary peers were excluded from the upper chamber, and there were only 666 members.  ""There is now a major concern that if appointments continue, the House of Lords will simply cease to be able to function,"" the group says.  The high numbers put a huge strain on resources, they say, make it difficult to manage debates and other business, and there are too many new peers who are unfamiliar with Lords culture, procedures and practices.  The group says a moratorium should be placed on new appointments until membership falls, through deaths, to 750 members.  On recent trends of about 15-20 deaths a year, that would entail a ban on new peers for five years or more.  ""Until the size of the chamber has dropped below 750 eligible members, the House of Lords should simple be considered 'full',"" the authors write. After that appointments should only be made to maintain the number up to 750.  This would mean that the coalition would have to drop its pledge in the May 2010 Coalition Agreement to make future appointments with the goal that membership of the Lords reflects the proportion of votes achieved by each party at the 2010 election.

34,"The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it had decided to investigate after receiving complaints from Mr Lubbock's family.  The complaints surround information Essex Police gave to a coroner and pathologist after Mr Lubbock's death.  Mr Lubbock, 31, was found dead at the entertainer's Essex home in March 2001.  Tony Bennett, the Lubbock family lawyer, said Mr Lubbock's family had made serious allegations about police officers.  In a letter to Mr Bennett IPCC commissioner Mehmuda Mian Pritchard said: ""The investigation into the complaint will be carried out by a police force under our full direction and control.""  The letter added: ""I believe it is important for the investigation to be carried out by an external force.""  Mr Bennett said Mr Lubbock's father Terry 62, who has campaigned for a new inquiry into his son's death, was delighted at the IPCC decision.  ""Our complaint centres on information police gave to a coroner and a number of pathologists,"" said Mr Bennett.  ""They said Stuart had been seen swimming in the pool earlier in the evening.  ""We believe that this was not true and feel that the police should at least have made it clear that there was some doubt about it.  ""Terry Lubbock has complained that there was either serious incompetence or some form of corruption.  ""We are delighted that the IPCC is to investigate and we will help in any way we can. All Mr Lubbock has ever wanted is the truth about what happened to his son.""  Essex Police conducted a lengthy investigation into Mr Lubbock's death but no-one was charged with any offences.  They announced in December 2006 they were reinvestigating the events at the house and the case remains open.  Mr Lubbock had been among a number of people at a party at Mr Barrymore's home in the hours before his body was found.  Post-mortem examination tests showed that he had suffered severe internal injuries which suggested sexual assault.  Alcohol, ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream.  A coroner recorded an open verdict following an inquest in September 2002.  A spokeswoman for Essex Police said officers were aware of the IPCC decision and would co-operate fully.  She said the force did not wish to discuss the allegations made by the Lubbock family while the investigation was pending."
35,"Australia has sent its first troops to the Persian Gulf for a possible war on Iraq amid furious public protest.  Demonstrators heckled Australian Prime Minister John Howard and defence chiefs as they said goodbye to 350 troops setting sail on Thursday from Sydney.  Mr Howard insisted the deployment did not mean that Australia had decided to support any war with Iraq, but rather that the pre-positioning of forces increased the ""likelihood of (the crisis) being resolved peacefully"".  But opposition parties, church and community groups, and anti-war activists condemned the move, which was made without recourse to Australia's parliament.  The troops leaving on HMAS Kanimbla will comprise an eventual Australian force of about 1,500 personnel and only 150 combat troops which will join some 180,000 US and British troops already stationed in the Gulf.  The personnel on HMAS Kanimbla were to join two other Australian ships already stationed in the Gulf policing sanctions against Iraq.  They will be followed by Australian special forces commandoes who will leave from Perth on Friday.  About 150 protesters shouted ""Go Yourself"" to Mr Howard as he waved off the HMAS Kanimbla contingent.  ""It is a monumental snubbing of the democratic processes in this country,"" said Greens party leader Bob Brown.  ""The Howard government should know that the people are not behind him,"" said Gillian Deakin, the co-ordinator of Medical Association for the Prevention of War.  ""This action is wrong and we are sending a very wrong message to our Muslim neighbours,"" she added.  Australia's response to the Bali terror attack last October, which has been widely blamed on a South East Asian Islamic militant group, has provoked tension within both its own Muslim community and its regional neighbours.  The Australian police have conducted raids on Muslim homes suspected of terrorist connections, and Mr Howard has threatened to wage pre-emptive strikes on any countries in the region suspected of harbouring terrorists."
36,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A Nottinghamshire singer has released a Christmas song she hopes will challenge Simon Cowell's X-Factor winner for the festive number one spot. Christmas Time is the title of Cathy Lesurf's single that comes out 30 years after she was last in the charts. As a member of Fiddler's Dram she reached number three in 1980 with Day Trip to Bangor. Cathy's song will not have the publicity clout of the X-Factor release. Her budget is £150. Three decades ago Cathy Lesurf performed on Top of the Pops with her group Fiddler's Dram. They never repeated the success of Day Trip to Bangor and are forever bracketed ""one hit wonders"". Cathy feels now is the time to lose that tag. The seeds of the song come from the death of a friend. Cathy and her husband, David Wilson, were putting together a benefit gig for Linda Sawyer when she died from cancer. The concert still took place and the legacy was that, after years of steering clear of the stage, Cathy and David were back behind the microphone. It rekindled their love of music. Then Cathy's 19-year-old daughter Rosalyn alerted her to the fact that more than 60,000 people had watched clips of Day Trip Bangor on YouTube. I wish him (Simon Cowell) all the luck in the world and I wish myself all the luck in the world. Let the people decide    Cathy Lesurf on competing against the X-Factor contestants It just so happened that David had written a tune for Cathy called Christmas Time. The singer said: ""We're all singing it round the house and I thought maybe it's time Bangor had a companion piece and I said 'hello' to all those people out there who like what I do."" The song was recorded in October 2009. A few weeks later a video was filmed in Cathy's back garden featuring family and friends. It was shot in a day. The whole process cost around £150 after Cathy, from West Bridgford, called in some favours. She said it matched the spirit of the song. ""It's about getting the family together, getting the tree, the presents. It's having a big Christmas Eve party, it's singing carols. I love the traditional message of Christmas. I love the love in it."" The chorus to the song goes: ""All the family round the tree, A gift for you, a gift for me."" Day Trip to Bangor was a hit for Cathy Lesurf and Fiddler's Dram in 1980 Composer David Wilson said: ""That's the heart of it - sharing gifts and expressing love and affection. It's thinking about the person you're buying the gift for."" Now Christmas Time is available to download (CD versions might be pressed if there is a demand), a facility that was not available when Fiddler's Dram were in the charts. ""This is something new for me. I come from the days of steam driven music,"" said Cathy. ""We're emailing everybody we know and we're asking everyone to download it and pass it on. We want it to go out at grassroots level. If it goes it'll be because people have made it go."" David Wilson said the omens are good. ""People I've played it to have made such a strong connection with it. It's a simple expression of the joy of Christmas. ""For that to make an impact gives me faith. It tells me people want to feel that simple love and affection."" David Wilson was not a fan of Christmas until he met Cathy Cathy Lesurf verses Simon Cowell is the musical equivalent of David verses Goliath but the Nottinghamshire singer is undaunted. ""I prefer to go with a positive approach that they'll do their thing and it's very different to mine. ""I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I could get back in the charts. I hope people hear it and like it and it's another little miracle like Bangor. ""I wish him (Simon Cowell) all the luck in the world and I wish myself all the luck in the world. Let the people decide.""     "

38,"Nurofen Plus, withdrawn from sale after contaminated packs were found, will go back on sale in tamper-proof wrapping.  The new stock will start appearing on pharmacists' shelves next week.  Manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser said the new packs would be individually wrapped in clear plastic.  A 30-year-old man from south London has been remanded in custody after five Nurofen Plus packs were found to contain anti-psychotic and anti-epileptic drugs.  Christopher McGuire is charged with one count of contaminating goods and two of administering a noxious substance.  The new packs will be clearly distinguishable from the old, because of the cellophane wrapping.  Dr Aomesh Bhatt, medical director for Nurofen Plus, said the company wanted to assure customers it had ""taken all possible steps"" to prevent any recurrence.  Thousands of packs of the pain relief tablets were recalled after the first reports of contamination. Distribution was stopped on 26 August.  Four packs were found to contain the prescription-only anti-psychotic drug Seroquel XL 50mg. They were bought in the London areas of Victoria, Bromley and Beckenham.  A pack containing prescription medicine for epilepsy, Neurontin, in 100mg capsules, was discovered in Northern Ireland.  Seroquel XL is a prescription-only anti-psychotic drug used to treat several disorders including schizophrenia, mania and bipolar depression.  Nurofen Plus is for pain relief and contains codeine and ibuprofen."
39,"The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has fined JP Morgan Securities a record £33.32m ($48.2m).  The penalty from the city regulator is for failing to protect its clients' money by lumping it in with its own over a period of almost seven years.  Under the FSA's rules, firms are required to keep customers' funds in separate accounts to protect it in case the financial firm becomes insolvent.  The misconduct was not deliberate and no clients suffered losses.  JP Morgan reported the error once it was uncovered, and worked with the FSA during the course of the investigation, the regulator said.  For that, it received a 30% discount on the original £47.6m fine.  During the period, the client money balance held varied between $1.9bn (£1.31bn) and $23bn.  Had the firm become insolvent at any time during this period, these funds would have been at risk of loss.  The BBC contacted JP Morgan Securities, which declined to comment.  Margaret Cole, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime, called the error a ""serious breach"".  She said: ""This penalty sends out a strong message to firms of all sizes that they must ensure client money is segregated in accordance with FSA rules.""  And, she said, JP Morgan Securities might not be the last to be fined: ""Firms need to sit up and take notice of this action- we have several more cases in the pipeline.""  ""If this doesn't serve to wake up every senior manager to check that he or she has carefully identified all risks and is properly managing them, then nothing will,"" said Simon Morris from CMS.  ""The one surprise is that FSA hasn't also gone against the senior managers responsible for this mistake, which is now its normal practice.""  The FSA sent out a warning to the industry last year after discovering that a number of firms had not been segregating client money adequately.  It set up a new unit within the regulator to specifically supervise client money."

Alright, he might be world number 1,153 at the moment, but he is on the rise - and none of the 1,152 above him have a more exotic moniker. Not even Mardy Fish.  Yet Mr Fulford-Jones may yet require a visit to the deed poll office if he wants to join the big boys of colourful sporting names, as our in-depth investigation shows.  Obviously, that's a silly thing to say. Batman is a fictional comic character while Daniel Batman is a real athlete who holds the Australian Indoor 400m record and will be hoping for success at the 2004 Olympics.  Although, thinking about it, the Aussie does have a butler called Alfred and he does live in a secret cave where he parks an unfeasibly stylish black car...  Baseball is chock full of interesting names, but Spooneybarger just gets the nod ahead of Dick Burns, largely on public decency grounds.  A relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, Spooneybarger's surname conjures up all kinds of exotic images.  Well one exotic image, really. That of an enormous barge. Shaped like a spoon.  The full names of Sri Lankan cricket players are mini-novels in themselves, and anagram fans, such as Richard Stilgoe, have been known to spend months toiling over the possibilities.  Warnakulasuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Vaas - or Chaminda to his friends - not only boasts one of cricket's longest names, but also 216 Test wickets in a distinguished career.  Honourable mentions to cricket icons Dickie Bird and Jack Russell, of course, but they simply cannot match Warnakulasuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Vaas.  Standing seven feet tall in his bare feet, Fucka has been rattling in the points for Barcelona, and has previously been linked with a move to the Indiana Pacers.  Rumours that he abandoned his career in soccer because every time he put his name on the teamsheet the referee sent him off are completely made up.  Eat your heart out, Arsene Wenger of Arsenal. For three years in Germany, club and manager names were unified in a manner we are unlikely to see again.  Sadly for all of us, Herr Wolf was sacked by Wolfsburg in March this year - the club foolishly placing such qualities as results and success above having an appropriately-named boss.  Happily, Wolf has found a new job at FC Nurnberg - all we need now is for him to change his name to Nurnberg Nurnbergsson."
41,"I was not surprised to see Jose Mourinho get his tactics spot on for Manchester United's 2-0 win over Chelsea, but he did not do it the way I expected.  Mourinho has masterminded plenty of wins in big games down the years, but he usually does it with a defensive approach and by setting up with a team that, first and foremost, is very difficult to break down.  On Sunday, he flipped that model on its head. United played with two up front and with wing-backs who were high up the pitch - they were on the front foot and went at Chelsea from the start.  It meant United produced a brilliant attacking display as well as a convincing defensive one that was tactically aware of the different threats that Chelsea posed.  Mourinho asked Ander Herrera to man-mark Eden Hazard and he did it brilliantly, but United's game-plan went much further than that.  They did not give Chelsea an inch of space anywhere on the pitch and did not allow them to get into any type of rhythm.  It started from the front, where Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard never stopped pestering the Blues defence, and Paul Pogba, Marouane Fellaini and Herrera seemed to win every meaningful battle in midfield.  When the ball did reach Blues striker Diego Costa, he always seemed to end up on the floor because Eric Bailly and Marcos Rojo put him under so much pressure.  United started the game so well and at such a high tempo that it seemed to take the wind out of Chelsea's sails.  I've played in games like that where I was surprised at the way the opposition were set up or they came at us quicker than expected but, usually, it takes about 15 minutes to figure it out.  In that time you think 'well, we are all over the place at the moment but let's hang in here and we will get our rhythm back'. Eventually you can take control of the situation, even if you do go a goal down.  United just did not allow that to happen, because they were constantly in Chelsea's faces.  Stopping Hazard was only part of that. Yes, he slipped through the net a couple of times when United tried to man-mark him when they lost in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge in March.  This time he did not get any joy at all, but Chelsea's problems at Old Trafford this time were not just because Herrera did a much better job than Phil Jones managed in that match.  When N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic play together in the Blues midfield, as they did against United, I think there is a genuine issue with their attacking play.  Defenders know that if Kante and Matic are playing, the ball is not going over the top. Costa does not make the runs for starters, which tells you everything.  They are both phenomenal midfielders but they are not going to deliver that sort of pass - there is a reason why Chelsea look far more dangerous when Cesc Fabregas is in the team.  Fabregas came on in the last 10 minutes at Old Trafford, when Chelsea were crying out for him in the first half as they were very predictable in possession.  When Chelsea tried to find Costa, their passes seemed to be too slow and too obvious. He kept having to come short, with Rojo or Bailly staying close to him and knowing exactly what he was going to do.  There was no variation in their play and, crucially, they did not get the basics right either, which is very unlike them.  United seemed to win every knockdown, tackle, or second ball in midfield, all of which helped them keep all the momentum.  They ran out deserved winners and kept alive their hopes of a top-four finish.  In my eyes, Herrera's performance was so good it made him a Mourinho player for life.  Mourinho now knows that if he needs someone to do a man-marking job - something ugly - he has the type of player who is clever and disciplined enough, and also has the physicality to do it.  The United manager will also have a bit more trust in the ability of young players like Rashford and Lingard after seeing them perform so well in such a big game.  Their pace gave something United different up front compared to when Zlatan Ibrahimovic leads the line.  Ibrahimovic has been brilliant this season and I still think he will be the man Mourinho looks to for the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final against Anderlecht on Thursday.  But having to choose between him and Rashford, who looked so sharp, is a good problem for Mourinho to have at such a busy time of the season.  Chelsea's trip to Goodison Park is the most difficult of their six remaining fixtures - Everton are flying at home, where they have won seven league games in a row.  Going to West Brom will be tricky too, because I am pretty sure Baggies boss Tony Pulis will set up exactly the same way he did against Liverpool on Sunday.  Pulis basically played with six at the back - four centre-halves and wingers that drop in as full-backs, which is a nightmare to play against - Liverpool were quite lucky to get their winner.  So, the Blues could drop points at The Hawthorns too, but I think they will absolutely wipe the floor with the teams they play in their four home games.  When you go through Tottenham's run-in, it is much harder, and they basically have to win all of their games to have a chance of winning the title.  Spurs will have to do it the hard way if they are going to be champions, but they have got the quality and depth in their squad to do it.  With the way they are playing at home, they have given themselves a chance - now they need more slip-ups from Chelsea."
42,"If you enjoy Tony's Dartmoor Diary, you may also like to take a look at Anton Coaker's Farming Diary.    Grass Roots is an informative and entertaining look at life down on the farm.        And if you want to see more of this beautiful part of the county, check out our Dartmoor Photo Gallery    The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites.     Way back in 1796 a Mr. Marshall published a book entitled 'The Rural Economy of the West of England'. He recorded a chapter on 'Dairy Management' in which he wrote, in some detail, on the way milk was scalded to produce 'CLOUTED CREAM'.      He related how the milk was first put into 'broad pans and vessels of brass or earthenware, stood for some hours, then placed over a gentle heat until the milk approached boiling heat, the proper heat being indicated by pimples and blisters rising to the surface of the cream'.    This method is still employed on many Devonshire farms, where a cream pan is always stood in another slightly larger pan which contains boiling water - scalding the cream we call it.      On NO account must the milk be allowed to boil or it will mar the whole process and all that will be left is a thin skin.      Mr Marshall continued by stating that cream when cooled is called 'scalded cream' or 'clouted cream', the later possibly describing the tough cloth-like texture which it acquires by this process. (Clout = Cloth. Remember the old saying 'Cast not a clout till May be out'?)     The cream remains thus on the milk - which is rendered 'very sheer lean and blue' by the process until needed to make butter or eaten as cream.      The clouts or rags of cream were thrown into a large wooden bowl and stirred by a circuitous motion of the hand and arm until the particles unite, leaving a small quantity of liquid called Butter Milk.      The solid mass could be turned into butter.     Fruits Of The Land  The origins of this method can be traced back to early farming days when the milk of two or three cows could be used for such a varied production of cheese, butter and cream - and the milk (by the aid of fire and heat) could be preserved for longer than fresh milk would keep (early pasteurisation?)      Marshall continued by mentioning 'Juncates', or junkets, as another peculiarity to the county.    Warm the milk, add a little rennet, so simple and delicious. Now then you Restaurateurs and high flying chefs, let us have Junket and Cream on the menu - and real cream at that! Now known as Clotted Cream - perhaps we should revert to the old name of Clouted Cream.    Clotted cream compliments so many different foods Do not forget the traditional Devon Cream Tea of scones, cream and strawberry jam. I knew an old farmer when I was just a 'Buye' who every day for breakfast had bread, cream and honey. He called it ""Fruits of the Land"".      He was right of course. Bread from the grain, cream from the cow and honey from that prolific worker the Honey Bee!      In Deb'm us puts the cream on the scone or bread first and the jam or honey on top. If you have neither jam nor honey, put on Golden Syrup and that's called ""thunder and lightning"".      My mouth is watering just thinking about it! See you soon. Yer old mate, Tony.   "
43,"The road into the camp looks like any other - a wide, dusty road dotted with scrub.  Wire fences separate Dili's newest residents from their neighbours, and Australian soldiers stand guard at the gate.  Inside, it has the restless, transitory feel of no-man's-land.  Not many governments would be delighted by the arrival in the capital of 600 rebel soldiers, but East Timor's leaders are counting this as one of their greatest achievements.  A month ago, the leader of these rebel soldiers - Alfredo Reinado - led an attack on the country's president and prime minister.  Maj Reinado was killed in the attack, and the president seriously wounded.  The shooting shocked many of Mr Reinado's followers into coming back down to the capital and accepting the government's offer of negotiation.  The government also launched negotiations with Mr Reinado's two surviving deputies.  One is now in custody in Dili, having surrendered. The other is rumoured to be close to doing the same.  It all looks very different from the last time violence broke out in Dili.  In early 2006, half of East Timor's tiny army - 600 soldiers - had deserted, and then been sacked, after complaining of discrimination.  The situation rapidly spiralled into near-civil war - 38 people died, 150,000 fled their homes, and the government was forced out of power.  This time, things have played out differently.  Negotiations seem to be working, and the government has stuck to the constitution and kept both the president and the parliament on board.  The prime minister's office is very pleased with itself.  One of the things it is most proud of is the establishment of a joint command to handle the operation - bringing together the army, known as F-FDTL, and the police, the PNTL.  For the past few weeks, the two security forces have been working together to support and back up the negotiations in the field.  This in itself is a miracle of sorts, according to political analyst Edward Rees.  ""Eighteen months ago, PNTL high command and F-FDTL high command were situated 150m away from each other in their headquarters in the centre of Dili, exchanging gunfire,"" he explained.  ""Today they're demonstrating a level of co-operation which would have been unthinkable.""  But he added a note of caution, saying the forces' problems were far from over.  ""PNTL and F-FDTL remain largely unreformed. They're still riddled with political differences, demonstrate poor discipline and neither is older than seven years old,"" Mr Rees said.  The need for reform of the security services became strikingly apparent when violence last broke out in 2006.  Then, the army and police were fighting each other and political influence in the armed forces was laid bare, as was the lack of discipline among serving officers.  The current crisis has given the government a chance to resolve the issues left over from that crisis - to make peace with 600 of its former soldiers, for example, or to allow tens of thousands of internally displaced refugees to return home.  But it has also created a window of opportunity to make major reforms.  With the threat from former rebels virtually neutralised, and the international forces still on the ground, many analysts believe now is the time to clean out the system.  Security sector reform has been a top priority for the new prime minister, Xanana Gusmao, but there does not seem to be much in the way of concrete plans to do it.  Part of the problem is that the judicial system itself is weak.  And without independent courts to deal with infractions, any reform is bound to fail.  To date, only four soldiers have been convicted for their part in the 2006 violence, and they were only taken into custody this week.  Will it be any different this time around?  The government says it will prosecute all those accused of criminal acts during this crisis.  But the acting president, Fernando de Araujo, hinted to the BBC that a presidential pardon for rebel leaders could not be ruled out.  ""It's stated in the constitution that the president has the authority to give pardons,"" he said.  ""It's the president's right, and I think our president, Mr Ramos-Horta, has a big heart.""  According to analyst Edward Rees, it is this collegiate atmosphere that makes it hard for the country to build strong independent institutions.  As he put it, East Timor still works like a family rather than a nation.  ""It's very difficult to impose an abstract conception of the rule of law upon a bunch of people who have emotional or sentimental attitudes towards each other,"" he explained.  ""Imagine what a small village is like in your own country, and imagine the role of the policeman in that village. He or she is not a policeman; they're more of a compromising negotiator.""  The shooting of the president on 11 February could have spelt trouble for East Timor.  Instead, the new government has handled the situation skilfully.  But it has been helped this time around by some useful developments, and unless it goes further in tackling the underlying problems of the country's institutions, there is no guarantee it will not face the same kind of situation again."
44,"Kirsty Young's castaway this week is the author Jung Chang. Jung was born in the years after Mao came to power in China and as a child she took part in the Great Leap Forwards by collecting saucepans and nails and trying to melt them down for steel. She was a teenager during the Cultural Revolution and witnessed her parents being denounced and sent to labour camps.  After Mao's death she came to Britain as a student. At the time, she says, she didn't want to think about the past - it used to give her nightmares and so she would pretend she was from Korea. But 10 years after her arrival in Britain, her mother came to visit. She told Jung the stories of her and her grandmother's lives and Jung decided their intimate, family history deserved to have a wider audience. Her book, Wild Swans, has sold more than 12 million copies and won a host of awards.  Investigating her own life and those of her mother and grandmother not only brought the suffering of a nation into sharp focus it was also a liberating experience - once the book was finished, she says, the nightmares stopped.

45,"Harry Potter is a global literary phenomenon but where does JK Rowling's creation figure in the canon of children's literature?  All three have inspired children across the globe to become substantial readers and deserve serious attention for this achievement alone.  Rowling's popular and commercial success identify her as culturally significant, but does that mean Harry has gained iconic status?  Has he already assumed a life beyond representation on page, tape or screen like Robinson Crusoe or Huckleberry Finn?  A literary icon develops the power of myth, generating meanings beyond the immediate narrative.  Rowling's peer, Philip Pullman, has also achieved this measure of literary creation - Iorek Byrnison, the armoured bear of the His Dark Materials series, shares this mythical strength, which lies far beyond mere inventiveness.  Rowling's fertile cleverness is of another breed from Pullman or Tolkien - we wait to see if Harry can haunt our imagination like the hobbits of Lord of the Rings or Iorek.  Rowling's fiction is characterised by narrative twists and turns, which have dazzling allure.  She also has shown legal and marketing genius.  In her four Potter books so far, Rowling has used the formula of the boarding school story and stayed within its constraints.  The setting is not unique - authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Anthony Horowitz have also used it.  Wynne Jones has been publishing for more than 30 years, and young readers have noted parallels between her books and Rowling's creations.  The 1982 book Witch Week, part of Wynne Jones' celebrated Chrestomanci series, features an owlish young hero at a boarding school for children who have suffered from society's persecution of witches.  Rowling shares with these writers a skilful use of illusion, delayed disclosure and moral certainty.  However, the boarding school formula creates unwieldy plots at the expense of poetic meaning.  Early, in the first book, Rowling draws upon the Nativity elements to encode her hero's significance - the three Magi, McGonagall, Dumbledore and Hagrid, recognise the infant Harry's importance.  The lasting achievement of Harry Potter as hero lies in the author's matching of his special powers (that children long to share) with the needs that make him so human.  The real Potter mystery lies ahead - whether Potter books six or seven can achieve the level of transcendental narrative meaning to place Rowling within the inner circle of the literary canon."
46,"Commenting on air he said: ﻿“So I have an announcement to make, as I said – I have my announcement to make, and I am now going to make my announcement. Thank you very much. And for most of our audience, it’s probably the last thing they want to hear me say. But you know me, I don’t do things by halves - so cue the sad music.  “I started this radio show in the morning back in January 2004 and it was my dream job, the one I wanted since a child – the coveted Radio 1 breakfast show. I know some kids wanted to be a professional footballer or a fireman but not me, I’m a geek. I wanted to be on the radio. I wanted the biggest radio show you can get and eventually, I got it. And for the last eight and half years, I’ve had the best time of my life. And I’ve got to share it with a small group of friends and 8 million strangers, every morning for three and a half hours a day. When I started, I wanted to do the show for 10 years and everyone thought I was nuts and some mornings it didn’t even feel like I was going to make it o 10 o’clock that day, but we always did.  “The weird thing about doing this job is that almost since day one there has always been speculation about how long it would last, rumours that the boss wanted me out, newspaper stories saying I’m going to be fired by the end of the year, printed whispers of my successor and when they would take over.

So I find myself at a time where nobody is looking my way, it’s all gone quiet. There aren’t any rumours about me being fired. It’s like people got bored with making stuff up and distracted by the rain and the Olympics. So I’m going to say it, not the papers or twitter, me. We’re going to leave the breakfast show. We’re not going to go yet, were going to be here next week and the week after that and we’ve got holidays booked in August and we’ll come back after that. I just want to give you a heads up and tell you that we’re going to wrap it up.  “Radio 1 are going to find someone new to host the show and they’ll put their take on it - Radio 1 can do that when they want to do that but this show is all about me and it’s all about the team and with the hope of sounding over the top and melodramatic I wanted to say thank you to everybody listening to the show for giving the team and me the best time ever.  “Me and Dave and Dom and Aled we’ve been here every day since the beginning and now Freya and Pippa and Tina have joined us and we love it, it has been the most fun, the best time ever and even during tough times this show has honestly been the best 3.5 hours of my day, every day. And I know that’s sad, but I am sad, I’m a geek, I’m a radio geek. I’m living this dream with millions of people every day listening, having a laugh, knocking around and I know it’s just a radio show but we’re all in it together. Me, the team, and every single one of us – 8 million of us, but it’s almost time to go and so we're off, so I just wanted to let you know.  “A couple more months of us and then it’s someone else’s turn to have a go, so thanks for listening and I hope you stay with us until the end because I promise it’s going to be brilliant and for those people who are thinking Jesus it’s just a radio show stop banging on about it, you don’t get it, and for everyone else who does get it - you know it’s all about me. I don’t do things by halves, my tongue is always buried deep in my cheek so thank you for listening, the show may now continue. In fact let’s go back to what this show is all about, let’s play some music.”  Chris will leave breakfast in September and is currently in negotiations with the station about a brand new show.  Ben Cooper, Controller BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra, said: “I’d like to thank Chris. Quite simply, he has been the most successful breakfast show host in Radio 1’s history. For the past eight and a half years he has been entertaining millions of listeners every morning, which is testament to his incredible talent as a broadcaster.”  Chris Moyles has presented the breakfast show on Radio 1 since January 2004 and in 2009 he became the station’s longest serving breakfast show host. He started off presenting the early morning breakfast show for the station in 1997, winning a Sony Silver Award for DJ of the Year the following year. He then went on to host the weekday drive time show before taking over the reins on breakfast.  Chris has won two Sony Gold Awards for the breakfast show, in 2006 for Best Entertainment Show and in 2008 for Best Breakfast Show. In March 2011, Chris and sidekick ‘Comedy’ Dave Vitty set a new Guinness World Record for broadcasting the longest music show by a radio team, staying on air for a whopping total of 52 hours and raising almost £3million for Comic Relief.  The new host of Radio 1 Breakfast Show will be announced on during Radio 1’s Newsbeat bulletin at 10.30am this morning."
47,"By BBC News Online's Martin Asser In video footage that will remain etched on memories for a long time to come, Israeli TV broadcast the lynching of Israeli soldiers by a furious Palestinian mob in the West Bank town of Ramallah. The film, shot by an Italian television crew, showed dozens of enraged Palestinians storming the police station where the soldiers were being held after they had been captured by Palestinian police. Gruesome scenes were visible through an open window as the mob savagely beat and stabbed two or possibly three of the soldiers to death. Then a body was thrown from an upstairs window. The frenzied crowd clapped and cheered as more blows were rained down on the lifeless figure by the crowd outside. Four men had been travelling in an unmarked car that was somehow apprehended on a street in Ramallah. At least two were killed a couple of hours later. The Israeli army said they were army reservists who had taken a wrong turning and blundered into Ramallah where their car was apprehended. Photographs show some of the doomed men were dressed in civilian clothes and one was photographed before his death wrapped in a black-and-white Palestinian head-dress. Anger had been brewing for the last two weeks which have witnessed the funerals of about 100 Arabs, nearly two dozen of them children, who have been killed in the violent uprising against Israeli occupation forces. But this outburst of fury apparently stemmed from rumours circulating through the mob that the captives belonged to the feared and hated undercover units of the Israeli army which dress as Arabs and strike in the heart of Palestinian towns. Earlier this week, the badly beaten body of a Palestinian, Issam Hamad, was found dumped on the outskirts of Ramallah. Palestinians blamed his death on Israeli settlers. Whatever the truth, the brutal death of these men - in full glare of TV - will have a lasting impact on the Israeli population and abroad. Their deaths were captured on film with the same power as the last moments of the short life of Muhammad al-Durrah, shot by Israeli troops 12 days ago as his father vainly tried to shield him with his own body. In the immediate aftermath of the killings the crowds on the streets of Ramallah were jubilant, even though they knew what was coming. Israel's overwhelming military might means that, unlike the Palestinians, it has the option of a dramatic and immediate response to those who cross its path. The inevitable wrath of Israel came just as noon prayers were being called. Wave after wave of missiles rained down on Ramallah, as well as Palestinian Authority installations in Gaza. The Palestinians called it war. An Israeli army spokesman said it was a limited operation intended as a ""symbolic message"" to the Palestinian leadership. Israel holds Yasser Arafat directly responsible for the deaths of its men because his policeman did not prevent, and in some cases actually took part in, the lynching."
48,"War in Sudan's Darfur 'is over'  Many displaced Darfuris live in camps across the border in Chad The six-year war between forces loyal to Sudan's government and rebels in Darfur has effectively ended, the UN's military commander in the region says. General Martin Agwai, who is leaving his post this week, said the vicious fighting of earlier years had subsided as rebel groups split into factions. He says the region now suffers more from low-level disputes and banditry. The UN says 300,000 people have died in Darfur, but the Sudanese government puts the figure at 10,000. Almost three million people are said to have been displaced by the fighting. Gen Agwai, who led a joint UN and African Union peacekeeping force known as Unamid, said the region now suffered more from ""security issues"" than full-blown conflict. ""Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that,"" he said. Gen Agwai said only one rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement (Jem), posed a real threat but even it no longer had the ability to conquer and hold territory. Sudan analyst Gill Lusk said his comments were ""unhelpful"" because they could lead people to believe that Darfur's problems had been solved. ""There has been a large decline in fighting in Darfur, and that is undoubtedly a good thing for the people,"" she told the BBC. ""But it is the government that turns the tap on and off - they can restart the violence whenever they want."" An aid worker in Sudan also questioned Gen Agwai's statement. ""If that is true, why do some parts of Darfur remain out of bounds, even for Unamid?"" she asked. Gen Agwai insists the real problem now is political. BBC Sudan correspondent James Copnall says that view is shared by many within Sudan. Although the intensity of the violence has reduced, there is still little prospect of a peace deal. Last week, US envoy to Sudan Scott Gration said the existence of 26 different rebel factions was a major obstacle to reaching a peace agreement with the government. He brokered talks which led to four groups agreeing to work together, calling the deal a ""very strong foundation for rebel unification"". The war broke out in the arid and impoverished region early in 2003 when rebel groups including Jem attacked government targets, accusing Khartoum of oppressing black Africans in favour of Arabs. Pro-government militiamen hit back with brutal force, which the US and some rights groups have labelled genocide. Khartoum denies supporting the militias, but the international court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant earlier this year for President Omar al-Bashir accusing him of war crimes.     "
49,"Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz has been honoured with a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.  The 36-year-old called the unveiling ""a very special day that I will always remember"".  The ceremony was also attended by Cruz's husband, actor Javier Bardem, and friend and Pirates of the Caribbean co-star Johnny Depp.  Cruz is the first Spanish actress to receive a star, which is located in front of the El Capitan Theatre.  ""Every time I look at that star, I will see the names of all the people that have helped me make many of my dreams a reality,"" Cruz said.  The actress said when she first arrive in the US in 1994, she only knew how to say ""How are you?"" and ""I want to work with Johnny Depp"" in English.  The pair later starred together in the 2001 film Blow.  Depp paid tribute to Cruz at the ceremony, describing her as ""a magnificent and magical woman"", adding it was ""a pleasure to be able to be here to celebrate this curious Spanish creature"".  Cruz made her acting debut on TV when she was a teenager and began her feature film career in the 1992 movie Jamon Jamon, opposite Bardem.  She went on to star in films including Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Vanilla Sky and Volver and won an Oscar for her performance in Woody Allen's Vicky Christina Barcelona which also starred Bardem.  She will next be seen on screen opposite Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which will be released in the UK in May."
50,"               Chav. It came to the fore as a word in 2005 really, I didn't remember hearing it much before that. It refers to a type of youth, supposedly uncultured, maybe a bit anti-social, perhaps even violent, but certainly marked out, at least from the point of view of the critic, by very bad taste. Chavs are supposed to wear a lot of flashy jewellery, white trainers, baseball caps, sham designer clothes. Girls expose a lot of midriff. Nothing racial about it all, I should say.      Now, whether it's cool or not to be a chav, I couldn't say - at least, not at my age! I find the linguistics much more interesting. It's a problem though, the linguistics. Where does the word come from? It's been around since the 19th century. Lexicographer Eric Partridge mentions it in his huge dictionary of slang and unconventional English. He talks about it coming from Romany (the language of the gypsies), 'chavy' - a child, or 'chaval' - a boy. And then later it was used for 'men' as well.      But nobody knows who's reactivated it in recent times. It's a noun, 'a chav', 'chavs', and also an adjective - people talk about 'chav behaviour' or 'chav insults' and that sort of thing. Oh, don't believe the popular etymologies that you read sometimes in the press and on websites. I saw one the other day, people said, 'It's an acronym, 'chav', from council house and violent' - well, no, it isn't, that was made up in recent times.

51,"A row over sexually explicit content on the web encyclopaedia Wikipedia and related sites has escalated.  Co-founder Jimmy Wales has given up some of his site privileges following protests by contributors angered that he deleted images without consultation.  Mr Wales had previously urged the removal of ""pornographic"" content from the user-generated site.  This followed a complaint about ""child pornography"" to the FBI from another Wikipedia co-founder.  In early April, the estranged co-founder, Larry Sanger, reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI, alleging that the organisation was ""knowingly distributing child pornography"".  He later clarified that his concern was not about photographs of children, but ""obscene visual representations of the abuse of children"", which can include drawings and sculpture.  Last week, administrators of Wikimedia Commons, a media file store widely used for Wikipedia articles, deleted hundreds of images.  Some images deemed by the Wikipedia community to have educational merit have since been reinstated.  Mr Wales had earlier posted his support for the removal of ""images that are of little or no educational value but which appeal solely to prurient interests"", deleting many pictures himself.  Pressure on the organisation had increased after Fox News reported the story, contacting a number of high-profile corporate donors to the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and related sites.  It asked whether the donors were aware of ""the extent of sexually explicit content"" on Wikimedia Commons.  It is not clear whether Mr Wales's support for the removal of explicit content was in response to Mr Sanger's concerns, pressure from Fox News, or something else.  But Michael Peel, Chair of Wikimedia UK, told BBC News that a continuous debate over explicit content has recently ""come to a head"". The central issue at the moment, he says, is ""whether the content is educational"".  ""Anyone can come to Wikimedia Commons and upload media. Illegal stuff is deleted, and copyright stuff is deleted.""  Mr Wales has faced criticism from the band of volunteers who help to maintain the site, some of whom argued that the decision to delete was undemocratic and taken too quickly. They also expressed concerns that valid material might be deleted accidentally.  On Sunday, in response, Jimmy Wales voluntarily revoked many of the ""permissions"" given to him as Wikipedia's founder, to delete and edit ""protected"" content on Wikimedia Commons.  In a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing list he said this was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".  A more detailed policy statement from the Wikimedia Foundation is expected in the coming days."
52,"The faculty of education, also known as Rolle College, will now be transferred to Plymouth. The 4,000 students and 300 staff will move to the city in 2008.  About 300 students walked out of the meeting as the announcement was made on Friday afternoon.  The university says consolidating activity at its Plymouth base strengthens its work.  It is claimed moving the campus, known as Rolle College, will cost the local economy £20m.  Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roland Lewinsky, said: ""In my view, this is a necessary development to help us achieve the mission of becoming an international centre of learning and research excellence serving the whole of the South West peninsula.  ""We now have several years of hard work ahead to manage the relocation with the minimum disruption for our staff and students.""  One mature student told the BBC the decision was a real blow.  ""There will be no hope of me going to Plymouth, so they've taken away the chance for mature students to get a further education."""
53,"They believe Joseph Merrick, who lived in Britain more than 100 years ago, could have suffered from type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) and Proteus syndrome.  They believe both conditions may have combined to trigger his severe physical deformities.  Their claim, which is featured in a new series on the Discovery Health channel, follows DNA tests on the man's hair and bones.  Merrick, who was born in Leicester in 1862, showed signs of deformity from the age of five.  By the time he was a teenager, he was completely deformed and had been rejected by his community and his own parents.  In his mid-20s, he met a surgeon who arranged for him to be admitted to the Royal London Hospital, where he died at the age of 27.  The cause of his severe deformities has baffled doctors for more than a century.  A team of international scientists sought to resolve the problem by carrying out DNA tests on his remains.  They obtained samples of his hair and bone. Tests suggested he may have suffered from NF1 or Proteus syndrome, or maybe even both.  NF1 is a rare genetic disorder. It can cause tumours to grow in several parts of the body and can cause enlarged deformations of bones.  Proteus syndrome is present at birth and can cause overgrowth in different parts of the head, including the head and limbs.  However, the tests were not conclusive.  ""He definitely had Proteus syndrome,"" Dr Charis Eng, a cancer geneticist at Ohio State University told BBC News Online.  ""Whether he had NF1, we cannot tell. Photographs and his death mask would suggest he had some of the features. I don't know.""  The scientists have kept the DNA samples and may carry out further tests in the future.  The TV series follows scientists in their efforts to try to find out what caused Merrick's severe deformities.  It also includes images of what Merrick would have looked like had he not been burdened by disease."
54,"A Middle East-based private equity group has finalised a deal to take over Leeds United.  GFH Capital has now started a one-month transitional period and, following Football League approval, will become 100% shareholder of the club.  Current owner Ken Bates will remain as chairman until the end of the season, when he will become president.  Bates told the club website: ""I can confirm we have completed all negotiations with GFH Capital.""  Leeds have confirmed that the new owners have been financially supporting the club since entering an exclusivity period.  Last Thursday the two parties revealed an agreement had been reached and relevant documents were being passed to the Football League.  The takeover will end a protracted period of uncertainty that began at the end of May when the Elland Road club announced they were in investment talks.  Bates added: ""Neil Warnock will continue as manager with more support than the present owners were able to give and we look forward to a smooth transition.  ""One thing I can say that has benefited from the negotiations is that this six-month courtship has given GFH Capital the opportunity to see the strengths and weaknesses and what needs to be supported.""  Hisham Alrayes, managing director of GFH Capital said: ""We are delighted to be able to announce the signing of this historic deal with one of the best supported football clubs in England.  ""This is a fantastic opportunity to put an amazing club back where it belongs as well as to help bridge national and international borders with football.""  After Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Millwall, Leeds sit in 18th place in the second tier but are just eight points off the play-offs and face Chelsea in the Capital One Cup quarter-finals in December."
55,"Saudi Arabia's cabinet has approved a ban on domestic and other abuse for the first time.  The new law sets penalties for all forms of physical and sexual abuse, both at home and in the workplace.  These include penalties of up to a year in prison and fines of up to $13,000. The law will also provide shelter for victims of domestic abuse.  Rights activists have welcomed the move but also questioned the effectiveness of the implementation of the law.  In legal terms, violence against women and children in the home has been a private matter in Saudi Arabia until now.  A women's rights activist told the BBC that the new law was a positive and long overdue step, but it needed to be fully implemented.  Suad Abu Dayyeh from the rights group Equality Now said the police and courts that would administer the law needed training programmes to adjust to it. She added that male guardianship - which still dominates relations between the sexes in Saudi Arabia - was likely to remain a major obstacle in enforcing the law.  Violence within the home against women and children used not to be discussed openly in Saudi society, but that has been changing recently.  A striking public information campaign against domestic abuse was launched earlier this year, featuring an image of a veiled woman with only her eyes visible - one clearly blackened. Underneath it said: ""Some things can't be covered up."""
56,"Mikhail Gorbachev has accused Vladimir Putin of ""castrating"" Russia's electoral system and said he should not seek re-election as president.  The ex-Soviet leader was interviewed by the BBC's Bridget Kendall on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the failed coup which led to the collapse of the USSR.  The action was aimed at reversing reforms overseen by Mr Gorbachev.  Mr Putin, the current prime minister, radically changed the voting system during his two terms as president.  He is widely tipped to stand again in 2012 and previously won landslide victories in 2000 and 2004.  Mr Gorbachev, 80, the Soviet Union's first and last unelected president, stood for election as Russian president in 1996, when he took less than 1% of the vote against his old foe, Boris Yeltsin.  He remains dismissive of the hardline plotters who tried to depose him in 1991 but is anxious about where Russia is heading now, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent reports.  He told the BBC that in the last two decades the country should have got further along the road towards democracy.  He laid much of the blame on Mr Putin who, in the view of many, remains the real power in the land.  ""Putin and his team are for stability but stability kills development and results in stagnation,"" Mr Gorbachev said.  ""The electoral system we had was nothing remarkable but they have literally castrated it.""  While president, Mr Putin drastically reformed the electoral system to effectively exclude independent candidates and smaller parties from parliament, and centralise control of the regions.  Mr Gorbachev acknowledged the Putin years had seen some achievements but said he did not think Mr Putin should stand again next year, as it was time for a change.  He said the next five or six years would be crucial and, if Russia missed this window and failed to modernise and become more democratic, it would forever lag behind.  Barred by the constitution from serving three consecutive terms, Mr Putin stood down as president in 2008 to allow his protege, Dmitry Medvedev, to be elected.  Mr Putin, who once described the collapse of the USSR as ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th Century"", congratulated Mr Gorbachev on his 80th birthday in March with a telegram.  He praised him as ""one of the great statesmen of modern times, who have made a significant impact on the course of world history""."
57,"Carlos Tevez's hat-trick helped Manchester City beat Norwich to reduce Manchester United's lead to two points at the Premier League summit.  Tevez's swerving effort beat John Ruddy before he set up Sergio Aguero.  Norwich replied when Andrew Surman blasted in after Joe Hart's punch.  But Tevez boosted the lead with a header and Aguero's solo effort added the gloss before Tevez rounded Ruddy to complete his hat-trick and Adam Johnson slotted in from close range.  The Argentine celebrated his third strike with a golf swing, perhaps mocking those who questioned his desire during his unauthorised leave of absence in his home country where he was pictured on the golf course.  But after a fractious period in his Manchester City career, his performance and the result showed that his team's title challenge was back on track.  For all boss Roberto Mancini's claims that his team have no chance of overtaking rivals United, who host Aston Villa on Sunday, the Italian's players showed they have not given up.  Aguero, who was also a menace and scored two fine goals, came inches away from matching his countryman's tally when he hit the post late on.  It was a deadly exhibition of finishing from the front two, and City look to have recovered their former fluency, but the scoreline was harsh on Norwich, who pressured the visitors early on, and tested them again after reducing the deficit to 2-1.  Four goals in the last 17 minutes swept their challenge aside to give Manchester City their first away league win since 12 February but before the visitors could take control, they had to withstand an early barrage from the in-form Canaries.  Paul Lambert's side almost led when Joleon Lescott cleared Grant Holt's header off the line following a corner, the visiting defenders protesting as Anthony Pilkington appeared to block Hart.  The Manchester City players had already made their feelings known to referee Chris Foy when Tevez was booked for diving, after he appeared to be caught by Ryan Bennett.  But soon after, Tevez's recent rehabilitation continued when he was fed down the right by a re-energised David Silva and struck a swerving shot that beat Ruddy at his near post.  The second goal was a gem as Aguero supplied Tevez in the inside left channel and then picked up his fellow countryman's backheel to fire past Ruddy.  That strike knocked the wind out of Norwich, with Grant Holt's effort on the half-turn the only significant return before the break.  In 2005, Norwich director Delia Smith issued her infamous ""Let's be 'aving you"" rallying cry during the interval in a Premiership game between these two teams. But the Canaries - who had won seven of their previous eight home league games - are a different proposition under Lambert, and the Scot settled for a double substitution to rouse his side.  The move quickly brought reward when one of the replacements, Surman, steered the ball in after Hart had punched Adam Drury's cross clear.  And the other replacement, Wes Hoolahan, helped improve Norwich's midfield as they supported the advanced Aaron Wilbraham.  But as Norwich pressed, the visitors almost caught them on the break twice and Yaya Toure's arrival from the bench proved pivotal as three goals then flew in during the space of seven minutes.  It fell to another substitute Johnson to complete the rout after a sweeping move, and with City to face bottom-of-the-table Wolves before they play Manchester United at Etihad Stadium on 30 April, their confidence could by then be sky high.  Norwich boss Paul Lambert: ""I think for 70-odd minutes we were well in the game. At 2-1 we looked really good and in the second half we played really well but if you're losing four goals in that space of time it was poor from our point of view. The effort was there in abundance, as it always is, but maybe the scoreline was severe.  ""You can't legislate for losing three goals in seven minutes, and we'll learn from it. You take your medicine and you bounce back. Their strike force is incredible, the first two goals were world class. [Our] team have done brilliant, I can't be too harsh on them.""

58,"                           Winnie Mandela was born in 1934 at Bizana, Pondoland, in the Transkei. She qualified as a social worker in 1953 and met her future husband, Nelson, while working at a hospital in the black township of Soweto in 1957. They married in June 1958, despite her father's objections that Nelson was too committed to politics and, at the age of 41, too old for her. Their early married life was punctuated by raids as the police cracked down on the ANC and by periods when Nelson was absent - either in hiding or in prison awaiting trial. Eventually, Nelson was jailed for life in 1964. Until then, Winnie had been involved in ANC politics but was not at the forefront of the struggle. Now she began to assume the mantle of Nelson Mandela's political heir, and to tread the path which led to her becoming known as 'Mother of the Nation'. Unsurprisingly, this led to a great deal of attention from the South African police force. Her home was frequently searched, she was frequently questioned and prosecuted for minor transgressions against the apartheid laws. The low point of this period came when Mrs Mandela was arrested in 1969 under the Suppression of Terrorism Act and imprisoned in solitary confinement for 17 months. This was followed by periods of banning and house arrest, and short spells in jail on minor charges. In 1976, a student uprising in Soweto was put down by force, leaving hundreds of people dead. Winnie was banished from Soweto to Brandfort in the Orange Free State, an area where she knew no-one and did not even speak the local dialect. It was at this time that Winnie Mandela became well known in the West. She organised local clinics, campaigned actively for equal rights and was promoted by the ANC as a symbol of its struggle against apartheid. In 1985, she defied her banning order by returning to Soweto after her home in Brandfort was firebombed. After being arrested for breaking the order, the government relented and allowed her to stay. The following five years were increasingly controversial. In 1986 she made a speech in which she talked about achieving liberation from apartheid by using ""necklaces"" - a reference to the brutal murder of suspected collaborators by putting tyres round their necks and setting them alight. There was also the matter of an opulent £125,000 house built in one of the poorest areas in the country. The most serious allegations, however, stemmed from the activities of her personal bodyguards, the so-called Mandela United Football Club. Reports of their brutality were commonplace in Soweto and her house was attacked in 1988 by local people who had had enough. Mrs Mandela refused to curb the team's activities, however, and the following year came the decisive incident. A 14-year-old activist, Stompei Seipei Moketsi, was kidnapped by her guards and later found murdered. The ANC leadership declared that she was out of control but Nelson Mandela, in jail and in ill-health, refused to repudiate her. In February 1990, Nelson Mandela was finally released from prison and Winnie walked by his side as the world watched his first steps of freedom for nearly 30 years. Initially, the couple appeared to have resolved any problems though Nelson refused to move into his wife's Soweto mansion. Gradually, however, relations between them cooled and in 1991 Winnie Mandela was charged with the assault and kidnapping of Stompei. Initially convicted and given six years in jail, Mrs Mandela appealed and had the sentence reduced to a fine. The trial was notable for witnesses who failed to appear or whose testimony contradicted statements which they had given the police. One of the key planks of her defence was an alibi that she was being driven elsewhere at the time of the kidnap - after the trial the driver denied that the journey had taken place. In 1992 Nelson Mandela tired of his wife's political and personal excesses and announced that he and Winnie were to separate. They eventually divorced in 1996 on the grounds of her adultery. Mrs Mandela, or Mrs Madikizela-Mandela as she became known after her divorce, was now extremely unwelcome at the top table of the now-governing African National Congress. She retained, however, a huge following among the rank and file by appealing to the radicals and to those who felt that progress towards equality was still too slow. For example, in 1993 she was suspended from the ANC Women's League for disloyalty but bounced back by winning election as its president - the following year 11 members of the ANCWL resigned in protest at her dictatorial behaviour. Also in 1994, she polled so well in the elections which saw Nelson made president that she not only became an MP but won the post of Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. Later that year she was elected to the ANC's national executive committee. In 1995, however, she made herself unpopular with the government by accusing it of not doing enough to combat racism. After widespread allegations of misappropriating government funds, she was dismissed from her ministerial post by her former husband. The careers of most politicians would have been finished long ago with such a record, but not Mrs Madikezela-Mandela's. Earlier this year she won a second term as president of the Women's League and even now is defying the ANC leadership by challenging its preferred candidate for the deputy presidency of the party. Victory in that poll would in theory put her in a strong position to run for high office some time in the future. But given the allegations made at the Truth Commission and opposition from within the ANC, that would mean a political comeback on a scale unprecedented even in Winnie Mandela's own career.                    [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive]"
59,"Romanian President Ion Iliescu has said his country will not give up its national flag despite the fact that it appears, to most observers at least, identical to that used by the central African state of Chad.  His comments follow unconfirmed reports in the Romanian media that Chad has called on the UN to examine the issue.  The flags of the two countries converged as far back as 1989 when Romania's dictator, Nicolae Ceasescu, was overthrown and the incoming government dropped the communist-era insignia from the flag's centre.  While both flags have blue, yellow and red stripes, some experts say the blue colour in Chad's flag is darker than that used in Romania's version.  But Mr Iliescu said there was no reason for Romanians to worry as Chad had only been an independent country since 1960.  ""The tricolour belongs to us. We will not give up the tricolour,"" he said.  The Romanian Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a press release that Romania had carried out the registration procedure called for by the Paris convention for the protection of industrial property in 1997.  The procedure is administered by a specialised UN agency, the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which registers state symbols, official signs and seals.  The Foreign Ministry said it had no knowledge of any claim being lodged against the registration within the required 12-month deadline.  It added that it had received no official notification from Chad regarding any move to raise the issue with the UN and said it was currently investigating the reports carried by the Romanian media.

60,"                           Festive glory in the heart of London To venture on to the shopping streets of London at Christmas, you need two things: cash and courage. Cash speaks for itself. But you also need to be brave to survive being crammed sardine-like into the various emporia of Oxford Street and Kensington. Britain's capital at Christmas does, nonetheless, have its attractions The famed Yuletide decorations are free to view and at their best when the shopping frenzy ebbs and the chances of being crushed are minimised. The combined histories of the most notable of London's festive illuminations - in Regent Street, Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square - go back over 50 years and are festooned with varying proportions of calm and strife. This year has been no exception. Regent Street, criticised for the size and commercialism of the sponsor Yves Saint Laurent's logo, was forced by Westminster City Council to replace the offending garland with a regulation size version. Oxford Street on the other hand, has simply been berated for the paucity of its offering. Lack of imagination and too heavy a reliance upon the ghosts of baubles past have been the most widely voiced complaints in recent years. So much so that the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Museum of London felt there was inspiration to be found in this festive desert. Ten of Britain's most skilled architects were commissioned to produce an exhibition of their individual flights of fancy for Oxford Street's Yuletide future. The ideas on display at the museum range from the elegant to the bizarre - a simulation Norwegian Wood to a space-age Christmas mirror ball. But all have fuelled the creativity of the public in the associated competition Turned On: Campaign for Better Christmas Lights. But why get in such a lather about what is, effectively, an arrangement of coloured bulbs? Well, it is tradition and eventually tradition becomes heritage. To put on a poor show is therefore to let the side down. As one lady shopper looking heavenwards in Regent Street put it: ""It's almost unpatriotic to have a dismal display down here at Christmas. A lot of people come, some even from abroad, to Regent Street and Oxford Street specially to see a good display to really get them in the mood for Christmas. It's become just as much a part of British life as the Royal Family."" Regent Street's lights first went up in 1954. Prompted by an article in the Daily Telegraph commenting on how drab London looked at Christmas, the retailers and businesses which made up the Regent Street Association organised and financed the first display. Oxford Street and its corresponding Association followed suit in 1959. Back then, the lights were so great a draw that they inspired an unsuccessful attempt in the House of Lords to bring action against the responsible authorities for causing chaos and obstruction. The magic of the West End stage lit up Regent Street in 1994 With a reputation for elegance and a declared conservation area, Regent Street has traditionally chosen lights on themes such as A Heaven Full of Stars or Imagination Chandeliers. Oxford Street, as London's most popular shopping street, has more of an eclectic approach, in keeping with the vagaries of public taste. Dark days came to London's centre at Christmas in the 1960s. The lights went out in Oxford Street in 1967 and four years later Regent Street also succumbed. Nothing changed until 1978 when financial power was restored. The resulting laser show devised by Oxford Street was a brave attempt but deemed just that little too dangerous. In 1979 there was a resumption of normal practices and funding has been an issue since then. In some years Regent Street has seen interesting variety as the lights take inspiration from their sponsor. Disney's Aladdin and Cameron Mackintosh's Celebration of West End Musicals have starred. But, for the last three years, we've had Flashing Crowns with Stars in Regent Street and a hotch potch of Christmas motifs in Oxford Street. Executive Officer of the Regent Street Association, Annie Walker, is aware of the need to spruce things up: ""In order to maintain a reasonable display, we need funding. The present display was bought three years ago and although it looks very nice, it's time to move on,"" she said. Despite the controversy, the lighting ceremony remains a matter of national interest and celebrity aspiration. To be invited to be chief switch thrower in Oxford Street means you are currently a people's favourite - take pop stars the Spice Girls and Peter Andre for example. And in Regent Street, you join a long line of Royals and choice notables such as former Prime Minister, John Major, and champion jockey Frankie Detorri. Other incidents of note aside from the comings and goings of the funding saga have been the fall of an 18-inch electric candle from its fitting over Oxford Street in 1959. It happened again later that same year, only the falling article was 15ft long and this time it caused a death. In 1963, the lighting of London was postponed as a mark of respect to the recently assassinated John F Kennedy. And in 1989, the great switch on in Oxford Street bowed to the power of pop celebrity, waiting several weeks past its usual mid-November date for Kylie Minogue to make a window in her hectic schedule. The history of the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree has, by comparison, been one of minimal fuss. The story behind it is one based in true traditional Christmas values of generosity and thanksgiving. In 1940, King Haakon VII of Norway fled his country hotly pursued by the Germans. He found asylum in Britain and set up a Norwegian Government in exile. For five years, in a house off London's Hyde Park, he was busy planning the means of his eventual return home. So grateful were the Norwegians for Britain's help that they decided to send an annual gift which measured up to the extent of their thanks and respect. The majestic Norwegian spruce was chosen. The very first tree in 1947 was 48ft and was presented to Britain two days before Christmas by the Norwegian Ambassador Hr Prebensen, after it had taken four days to dig a 6ft hole in the middle of Trafalgar Square. ""This is a symbol of the extremely close and cordial relations existing between Norway and Britain,"" he said. ""I am convinced that these relations will continue."" Although the tree is about 75ft, not much else has altered in its 51-year history. Every year it is picked out by the Head Forester from the 17,500 hectares of Oslo's municipal forests. It is carefully cut down in an intricate procedure involving tractor, clamp and cradle and transported to Oslo docks from where it begins its journey to Felixstowe. At first light the tree is crane-lifted into the now permanent setting equipped with socket, clamp and electrical point in the square. Last but not least, it is shrouded in its traditional Norwegian mantle of 500 white lights surmounted by a star which are turned on at a special ceremony attended by Norwegian Embassy guests and British officials and heralded by the choir of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The lights shine out every day from noon to midnight until twelfth night. But its journey doesn't finish there. At the International Woodworking Exhibition at Wembley Exhibition Centre in February they will be selling master craftwork in aid of Children in Need, made from genuine Norwegian pine. Norway continues to spruce up Trafalgar Square at Christmas But it hasn't been all sweetness and lights. Cordiality has been threatened on more than one occasion. In 1960 there were plans to charge Norway a higher electricity bill until Parliament intervened. In 1980 Westminster Council wanted to stop the tradition to save the £5,000 cost. The tree's physical fortitude has been tested too. It suffered breakages in 1978 and 1994. Protesters decided it would be effective to chain themselves to it in 1987. It has even been subjected to a chain-saw attack. But try as some might, not even Brussels bureaucrats, with claims about the breaking of import restrictions, have been able to fell the mighty pine. Such is the scene in London this Christmas. But, if the winners of the Turned On competition get to put their futuristic designs into practice it could all look very different before long.                  "
61,"A Paris court has said Continental Airlines was ""criminally responsible"" for the crash of a Concorde supersonic jet 10 years ago, and fined it 200,000 euros (£170,000).  It has also been ordered to pay 1m euros to the jet's operator Air France.  A Continental mechanic, John Taylor, was given a 15-month suspended prison sentence over the crash.  Continental has said it will appeal, saying the verdict is ""absurd"" and ""only protects French interests"".  Another airline operative, Stanley Ford, and three French officials were cleared.  The Concorde caught fire shortly after take-off from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris in July 2000, killing 113 people.  The court ruled that the crash was caused by a piece of metal left on the runway after falling from a Continental jet. Investigators said this caused a tyre-burst in the Concorde, which in turn ruptured a fuel tank.  The judge in the case confirmed investigators' findings that titanium debris dropped by a Continental DC-10 onto the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport before the Concorde took off was to blame.  Mr Taylor should not have used titanium parts to make repairs on the DC-10 because the metal was known to be too dangerous for aeroplane tyres, and he should have used a softer metal, aluminium, instead, the court found.  Continental had disputed this interpretation, saying the airliner, operated by Air France, was already in flames before it hit the small piece of titanium.  ""While we agree with the court's decision that Stanley Ford was innocent of the charges he faced and we share his relief that his decade-long nightmare is over, we strongly disagree with the court's verdict regarding Continental Airlines and John Taylor and will of course appeal this absurd finding,"" a UK-based Continental spokesman said in a statement.  ""Portraying the metal strip as the cause of the accident, and Continental and one of its employees as the sole guilty parties, shows the determination of the French authorities to shift attention and blame away from Air France, which was government-owned at the time and operated and maintained the aircraft, as well as from the French authorities responsible for the Concorde's airworthiness and safety.""  Financial claims were not the trial's focus, but apportioning blame was, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris.  However, the court ruled that Continental should pay 70% of any compensation claims to the families of victims. Aerospace group EADS was asked to pay the remaining 30%.  Following Monday's verdict, Air France, which paid out 100m euros in compensation, may decide to seek to reclaim some of that money from Continental.  There is a separate court case taking place over economic compensation for the crash.  Most of the passengers were German tourists heading to New York to join a luxury cruise to the Caribbean. Nine French crew members and four hotel workers also died."
62,"The Williams Formula 1 team is to float on the Frankfurt stock exchange in an official public offering.  The IPO will include a public offering in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with the first day of trading in its shares in early March.  There will be a private placement for institutional investors outside those European countries, and outside the US, Canada, Japan and Australia.  Swiss-based Bank am Bellevue AG will act as sole global co-ordinator of the IPO, and the offering will consist of up to 27.39% of existing shares, which is 2,739,383 shares.  Williams are one of the most successful teams in F1, but they have slipped from the pedestal they occupied when they dominated the sport for much of the 1980s and 1990s.  They have not won a championship since 1997 and last won a grand prix in 2004 and have in recent years struggle to raise the budget required to compete at the front.  Williams finished sixth in the constructors' championship in 2010 and at the Brazilian Grand Prix the German Nico Hulkenberg took their first pole position for five years.  Hulkenberg has not been retained for 2011 after Williams decided to take on the Venezuelan rookie Pastor Maldonado, whose presence is linked to a multi-year, multi-million pound sponsorship deal with his country's state oil company, PDVSA.  Their lead driver will continue to be the Brazilian veteran Rubens Barrichello, a former Ferrari driver who has competed in more grands prix than any other driver in history."
63,"Details of plans for Army restructuring were announced by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon on Thursday. Four infantry battalions are to be axed, reducing the number from 40 to 36. The infantry will be organised into larger, multi-battalion regiments. One battalion will go from the Scottish Division, one from the area west of the Pennines, one battalion from the Prince of Wales's Division in the south of England and one from the Parachute Regiment. Two historic single battalion regiments in Scotland are to merge. The Royal Scots will merge with The King's Own Scottish Borderers. They will combine with the other four Scottish regiments, including the Black Watch, to form a new large regiment, The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Mr Hoon said the identities of the regiments would be preserved by including them prominently in the battalion titles of the new regiment. In England, the King's Own Royal Border Regiment will amalgamate with the King's Regiment and the Queen's Lancashire Regiment to form two new battalions within the new King's Lancashire and Border Regiment. One battalion will go from the Prince of Wales's Division through a merger of elements of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, which will then merge with the Light Infantry, while the rest will merge with the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. The fourth infantry battalion reduction will be found by removing the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment from the infantry structure, and using its manpower as the core of a new, tri-service ranger unit. The Army will not reduce the number of Gurkha or Foot Guards battalions. In addition to these changes, other regiments will also merge to form new larger regiments. The Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Regiment of Wales will combine to become the Welsh Regiment. The Staffordshire Regiment, Cheshire Regiment and Worcester and Sherwood Foresters will combine as the Mercian Regiment. The Duke of Wellington's Regiment, The Prince of Wales' Own Regiment and The Green Howards will come together to form The Yorkshire Regiment . As part of the wider rebalancing of the mix of light, medium and heavy forces, 19 Mechanised Brigade will re-form to a light brigade from next month. It will be ready to be deployed, if required, in 2006 when it will serve as the contingent Nato response force. The 4 Armoured Brigade, which is currently based in Germany, split between Osnabruck and Munster, will begin to convert to a mechanised brigade in 2006. The manpower freed up by the reduction in battalions will be reallocated to key specialities such as communications, engineers, logisticians and intelligence experts, where there are current shortages. Mr Hoon said the Territorial Army will be more closely integrated with the Army for training and operations. Each of the 14 regular TA infantry battalions will be part of a regular parent regiment. There will be a reduction in the Corps of Army Music (CAMUS) by around 280 posts. This will result in the reduction of six Army bands and reduce the size of a seventh. Bands will continue to be identified primarily with regiments and corps and, given the importance of military music to the maintenance of regimental spirit, will continue to be organised on the basis of their primary role - the provision of Army music. Individuals affected by the changes will be provided with the chance to retrain for on new tasks. However the reductions in infantry and bandsmen will require a limited redundancy programme. The Army will continue around its current size. At around 102,000 strong it will continue to require over 11,000 new recruits every year.        "
64,"Isaac Newton is, as most will agree, the greatest physicist of all time. At the very least, he is the undisputed father of modern optics,­ or so we are told at school where our textbooks abound with his famous experiments with lenses and prisms, his study of the nature of light and its reflection, and the refraction and decomposition of light into the colours of the rainbow. Yet, the truth is rather greyer; and I feel it important to point out that, certainly in the field of optics, Newton himself stood on the shoulders of a giant who lived 700 years earlier. For, without doubt, another great physicist, who is worthy of ranking up alongside Newton, is a scientist born in AD 965 in what is now Iraq who went by the name of al-Hassan Ibn al-Haytham. Most people in the West will never have even heard of him. As a physicist myself, I am quite in awe of this man's contribution to my field, but I was fortunate enough to have recently been given the opportunity to dig a little into his life and work through my recent filming of a three-part BBC Four series on medieval Islamic scientists. Popular accounts of the history of science typically suggest that no major scientific advances took place in between the ancient Greeks and the European Renaissance. But just because Western Europe languished in the Dark Ages, does not mean there was stagnation elsewhere. Indeed, the period between the 9th and 13th Centuries marked the Golden Age of Arabic science. Great advances were made in mathematics, astronomy, medicine, physics, chemistry and philosophy. Among the many geniuses of that period Ibn al-Haytham stands taller than all the others. Ibn al-Haytham is regarded as the father of the modern scientific method. As commonly defined, this is the approach to investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge, based on the gathering of data through observation and measurement, followed by the formulation and testing of hypotheses to explain the data. This is how we do science today and is why I put my trust in the advances that have been made in science. But it is often still claimed that the modern scientific method was not established until the early 17th Century by Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that Ibn al-Haytham arrived there first. In fact, with his emphasis on experimental data and reproducibility of results, he is often referred to as the ""world's first true scientist"". He was the first scientist to give a correct account of how we see objects. It is incredible that we are only now uncovering the debt that today's physicists owe to an Arab who lived 1,000 years ago    He proved experimentally, for instance, that the so-called emission theory (which stated that light from our eyes shines upon the objects we see), which was believed by great thinkers such as Plato, Euclid and Ptolemy, was wrong and established the modern idea that we see because light enters our eyes. What he also did that no other scientist had tried before was to use mathematics to describe and prove this process. So he can be regarded as the very first theoretical physicist, too. He is perhaps best known for his invention of the pinhole camera and should be credited with the discovery of the laws of refraction. He also carried out the first experiments on the dispersion of light into its constituent colours and studied shadows, rainbows and eclipses; and by observing the way sunlight diffracted through the atmosphere, he was able to work out a rather good estimate for the height of the atmosphere, which he found to be around 100km. In common with many modern scholars, Ibn-al Haytham badly needed the time and isolation to focus on writing his many treatises, including his great work on optics. He was given an unwelcome opportunity, however, when he was imprisoned in Egypt between 1011 and 1021, having failed a task set him by a caliph in Cairo to help solve the problem of regulating the flooding of the Nile. While still in Basra, Ibn al-Haytham had claimed that the Nile's autumn flood waters could be held by a system of dykes and canals, thereby preserved as reservoirs until the summer's droughts. But on arrival in Cairo, he soon realised that his scheme was utterly impractical from an engineering perspective. Yet rather than admit his mistake to the dangerous and murderous caliph, Ibn-al Haytham instead decided to feign madness as a way to escape punishment. This promptly led to him being placed under house arrest, thereby granting him 10 years of seclusion in which to work. He was only released after the caliph's death. He returned to Iraq where he composed a further 100 works on a range of subjects in physics and mathematics. While travelling through the Middle East during my filming, I interviewed an expert in Alexandria who showed me recently discovered work by Ibn al-Haytham on astronomy. It seems he had developed what is called celestial mechanics, explaining the orbits of the planets, which was to lead to the eventual work of Europeans like Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and Newton. It is incredible that we are only now uncovering the debt that today's physicists owe to an Arab who lived 1,000 years ago.

65,"Four men have been found guilty of killing paperboy Carl Bridgewater.  Three of the four - James Robinson and cousins Vincent and Michael Hickey - were convicted of murdering Carl after he stumbled across a burglary during his paper round.  The other man, Patrick Molloy, was found guilty of manslaughter.  All four were found guilty of aggravated burglary and will be sentenced on Monday.  At the start of the five-week trial Carl Bridgewater was described by the prosecution as a ""cheerful boy"" who had set off on his evening paper round ""without a worry on his mind"".  The 12-year-old's murder after he delivered a paper to Yew Tree Farm in Stourbridge, Staffordshire, caused a national outrage.  Members of the criminal fraternity even broke their traditional code of silence to volunteer information to the police.  In court, judge Mr Justice Drake paid tribute to the ""thorough"" detective work which captured the defendants.  However, the men's conviction rested largely on a confession by Patrick Molloy, 51. Molloy told police he and the others were robbing Yew Tree Farm when Carl walked in through the unlocked door. He said he had been upstairs at the time but heard a bang and when he came down the boy's body was on the settee. In his statement Molloy claimed he heard Robinson say the gun had gone off accidentally. However, none of the others confessed to shooting Carl and the question of why he was killed still haunts his parents, Janet and Brian. They were both in court to hear the verdicts and later called for the return of hanging for some crimes such as ""the killing of children who can do you no harm"". Mr Bridgewater said: ""I believe hanging should be brought back, but if they are given life sentences, then they should stop in for life."""
66,"Sixteen years ago, thousands of Mongolians gathered to demand an end to decades of communist rule. They got their wish, but democracy has not brought the better life that many people hoped for.  High on the grasslands of Mongolia it does not seem as though much has changed in hundreds of years.  The vast steppe still rolls on forever until blue sky and yellow earth become one.  The nomads, astride their small fast ponies, still herd their animals from summer to winter pastures, following in the footsteps of their ancestors.  Once half of Mongolia's 2.8 million population lived this way, but now things are changing rapidly.  Sharhuu has spent his entire life on the grasslands.  Now in his sixties, his face weathered from years spent on the steppe, he is thinking the unthinkable - giving up the old ways forever.  And he is not alone.  A series of long tough winters have hit the nomads hard, destroying livestock and leaving many here with nothing.  There is little good grazing land for the animals that are left.  And since the end of communism in the early 1990s, and Mongolia's move to a market economy, there has not been much help from the government.  Like many nomads, Sharhuu has little option but to move to the cities.  But central Ulan Bator is a world away from the grasslands - traffic-clogged shopping streets.  It is a sign of how much things have changed since popular protests in the early 1990s brought nearly seven decades of communist rule to an end.  The communists did not disappear - the old revolutionary leader Sukhbataar still presides over the main square - and many of them are now in the current government building a new future for the country.  Only now the talk is of money not Marx. Mongolia's economy grew by around 6% last year and some people are doing very well.  At a building site in the centre of town I meet Tsendee. He started his construction company with just 10 employees. Now he has got 400 workers on the payroll.  ""Since Mongolia became a democracy and a market economy, many businesses like mine have done very well,"" he tells me.  ""For me this has meant a huge change. I can afford to do anything... life is great.""  But despite these changes, between one third and one half of the country lives in poverty, according to government statistics.  Many of them end up in the vast shanty towns on the outskirts of Ulan Bator, surviving on just a few dollars a day.  One of those is Byambasuren whose husband was an alcoholic who used to beat her.  In the end she threw him out and now she is bringing up her three children on her own in a tiny hut with no glass, just plastic sheeting, in the window frames.  ""Our life was good during communism but capitalism has left us with nothing,"" she tells me. ""The government has done nothing to help us and nobody cares.""  The government say it is doing more to help fight poverty.  But many claim it is not enough and in Ulan Bator anger is growing about the gap between rich and poor.  Protests in the main square are now a daily occurrence.  In a country where the future is far from certain, many are looking for a national hero - someone who can give Mongolians a fresh identity.  But the man they are thinking of has been dead for centuries.  Genghis Khan - or Chinghis Khan as he is known to Mongolians - is a reminder of the days when Mongolia ruled from China to the gates of Europe.  Today he is big business. His image used to sell everything from clothes to cars.  And he is even doing his bit for the country's nightlife as well.  At the Genghis Khan nightclub, the main drink is, of course, Genghis Khan beer, and the man himself has no shortage of admirers.  ""During the years of communism we had Lenin and Marx,"" one man tells me. ""Now Genghis Khan has become our hero.""  It is no surprise that Genghis Khan is still so popular. He is symbolic of a proud history.  In the past this vast nation has been slow to change. But the last 16 years have been times of massive upheaval.  Some have fared well in this brave new world, but many, like the nomads and the poor are struggling to catch up.  Mongolia is still one of the poorest countries in Asia.  Turning this ancient country into a modern one is a huge task and, despite nearly two decades of reform, Mongolia still has a long way to go."

Two other new forces will be created from six existing county forces in the east of England, and Surrey and Sussex will also join together.  Hampshire, Kent and Thames Valley won a reprieve and will stay as they are.  The Conservative Party opposes the changes, saying they would need to see ""independent evidence"" that the benefits outweighed the costs.  The home secretary told the Commons in a written statement: ""My vision for the police service in the 21st century is that it should be close, responsive and accountable to the communities it serves.""  He said community policing would be supported by larger forces with the ""capacity and specialist expertise to protect the public from wider threats such as serious and organised crime.""  Mr Clarke is due to meet representatives from police forces and authorities in affected areas on Monday.  Police authorities have until 7 April to respond to the proposals, although the final say on the reforms lies with the home secretary.  The Conservatives' Nick Herbert labelled the proposed mergers ""expensive, disruptive and unwanted"".  ""We believe that the public should be properly consulted about the future structure of their local police force.  ""Mergers should not proceed unless there is independent evidence that the benefits clearly outweigh the costs, and local people have endorsed the changes in a referendum.""  Together with another set of amalgamations announced earlier this month, the plans would reduce the number of forces in England and Wales to 24.  A decision on mergers has yet to be made in the South West and in the Yorkshire and Humber region, but if mergers set out by the Home Office in November are followed, England and Wales would be left with 17 forces.  The Association of Police Authorities had accused ministers of trying to ""bribe"" forces into submission by offering extra cash to those who submit merger plans quickly.  In an unprecedented revolt in December, the police authorities ignored a deadline set by the home secretary to submit detailed plans for the mergers."
69,"Plans for the redevelopment of Bath Rugby's Recreation Ground stadium have been unveiled.  The club appointed a team of architects and consultants to work on the proposal earlier in the year.  Improvements could see a revamp of the west stand and north terrace, a removable east stand and an extended south stand.  Chief executive Nick Blofeld said making the plans public is a ""major milestone"".  He said: ""We have been working towards these proposals for a long time, and our aim has always been not only to provide excellent facilities for our team and fans, but for other users of the Rec too.""  The plans will go on display to the public at an exhibition over the weekend.  For those unable to attend, details can be found at the Bath Rugby website.  Architect Simon Pugh-Jones said: ""We believe the design expresses and celebrates the festival spirit of match days; brings new life and activity to the Recreation Ground and the riverside, and that draws from, and contributes to, the rich cultural and historic context of the city.""  Earlier in the year, the Charity Commission granted the Recreation Ground Trust the power to make a decision over the granting of a new lease to the club.  Bath are seeking the lease so they can redevelop the stadium to Premiership Rugby standards.  However, planning permission for the redevelopment proposal will still need to be sought from Bath and North East Somerset Council."
70,"It is the fruit trucks that are most rigorously checked. They typically carry crates of watermelons.  Piled on top of each other, they are, the authorities say, a classic place for immigrants to hide.  One of the vehicles pulls up at Patras port. The customs officers spring into action, cutting holes in the cardboard boxes to check the fruit, clambering inside to prod and search and shining torches underneath. After a lengthy process, the truck is cleared to board the ferry.  Patras is one of Greece's biggest ports - known as the gateway to the west. Ships here leave to Italy and the vehicles on board often travel further still. It is a smugglers' hub into Europe - one of the continent's most vulnerable borders.  Suddenly there is a commotion in one corner. The guards have opened a vehicle containing gas canisters. And five men are found crammed inside. They sit, heads bowed. One says he is from Afghanistan.  The driver is taken to be questioned by the prosecutor. As officers enter the vehicle one of the migrants falls to the floor, crying uncontrollably. A guard hands him water and tries to calm him.  ""They will now be searched to see if they have relevant papers,"" says Evangelos Tasntzalos, the regional coastguard commander.  ""Then they'll be ordered to leave the country - and while they're waiting they won't be allowed in Patras or in the other big port, Igoumenitsa.""  More than 1,500 illegal immigrants were caught in Patras last year; every vehicle carrying them was impounded.  But while the port authorities are rigorous in their checks, plenty more migrants will attempt the journey. Over 80% of those entering the European Union now pass through Greece.  The typical route is in through the north-eastern corner of the country, across the Evros river from Turkey. They continue through Athens and down to Patras, in limbo until they pick what they hope is the right time to leave.  ""I'm scared I'll die at any time because it's so unsafe here,"" one Afghan says while cowering on a disused railway track. ""Nobody looks after us - there are no human rights in Greece. My dream is to go to England and I'll try every day to get there.""  The influx of new arrivals here has made immigration a hot social issue and a key theme in the upcoming election. In last month's inconclusive poll, the virulently anti-immigration Golden Dawn party swept into parliament for the first time in its history, promising to lay landmines along the border with Turkey.  The party rejects the neo-Nazi label, but its leader has been filmed making Hitler salutes, and he recently denied that gas chambers were used in the Holocaust and said the figure of six million Jews killed was ""an exaggeration"".  During a heated TV debate on Thursday a party spokesman hit a woman MP in the face, prompting a warrant for his arrest.  Last month, Golden Dawn members rounded on a derelict factory in Patras traditionally used by immigrants for shelter. They threw petrol bombs and set fire to parts of the building, clashing with riot police. The incident was sparked by the murder of a Greek man, allegedly by three Afghans.  The victim's cousin, Thymios Koklis, says the attitude of Greeks towards uncontrolled immigration is hardening.  ""We can't have so many immigrants - we don't even have jobs ourselves,"" he says. ""The migrants are in a way the victims of this whole story. But I would blame the government that doesn't do anything to protect Greeks from the hordes who come here. We're very scared of them - people say they would take the law into their own hands.""  Would he take the law into his own hands?  ""If the state can't protect me, someone has to. Myself and my family,"" he says.  Migrants now steer clear of the factory, leaving behind bits of soiled clothing and empty food packaging - the remnants of past lives strewn across the decaying floors. The building is a vast and squalid labyrinth - bits of Arabic graffiti are scrawled on the walls, shards of mangled concrete lie hanging and the place has a dank smell. There is even excrement in some corners.  Charities working on the issue say Greece must do more to help the vulnerable - and wake up to the bubbling tension.  ""I feel ashamed when I see how immigrants are treated,"" says Haralambos Tabakis from the immigration group Praksis. ""This is not the right way to deal with the issue. Greeks have been migrants for many years - we have left to Europe, the US, Australia: we would never have liked to be treated in this way. We know what migration is all about.""  As dusk falls, the hidden migrants of Patras come out to line the waterfront, gazing across the ocean to a new life. As they wait here, the immigration issue grows ever more volatile.  They came to this troubled country with dreams of Europe. But Greece is sinking further into crisis and the mood here is darkening - on all sides."
71,"The Swedes took the lead when Zlatan Ibrahimovic raced down the right and set up Freddie Ljungberg to tap home.  Ljungberg was fouled in the box to earn a penalty that Ibrahimovic converted before sub Marcus Allback rifled in a terrific volley in stoppage time.  Sweden made a lively start and Ibrahimovic brilliantly controlled a raking through ball only to see his goalbound shot deflected away for a corner.  Bulgaria were making their first appearance in a major tournament since a 6-1 thumping at the hands of Spain in the 1998 World Cup, but after starting nervously they soon acclimatised to the ferocious pace of the game.  Sweden suffered a scare when Marian Hristov tumbled in the box, but English referee Mike Riley waved play on.  Soon after, Bulgaria had a real chance to go in front, Martin Petrov swinging in a lovely cross from the left that Jankovic volleyed narrowly wide.  As the game swung from end to end, Larsson directed Mikael Nilsson's right-wing cross over, before Berbatov's thumping header forced Isaksson to brilliantly tip over the bar.  Just after the half-hour mark, Sweden went ahead. Ibrahimovic raced away down the right after a mistake from Ivailo Petkov, and the Ajax striker surged into the box and fed Ljungberg, who tapped home from six yards.  Bulgaria almost replied immediately, but Stilian Petrov's sizzling 30-yard volley flashed wide of Isaksson's right-hand post.  The second half began in the same fashion with both sides creating chances. First Jankovic headed wide from close range when it looked easier to score.  Moments later an impetuous flick from the cunning Ibrahimovic sent Ljungberg through, but the Arsenal midfielder could only shoot straight at Zdravkov.  Bulgaria went within inches of levelling when Martin Petrov's right-foot curler flew just past Isaksson's left-hand post, but within two minutes the game was over.  Just 71 seconds later the game was over, Andreas Svensson sending the ball across the face of goal for Larsson to neatly slot into the roof of the net.  Bulgaria looked shell-shocked and in truth they did not deserve such a heavy beating, though it almost got worse when Ibrahimovic danced through again only to be thwarted by Zdravkov.  It soon was four. Ljungberg's surging run was ended in the box by Vladimir Ivanov's foul and Ibrahimovic coolly slotted home the penalty.  Marcus Allback was sent on for Ibrahimovic with ten minutes to go and the Aston Villa striker sealed a magnificent display with a fine finish to make it five in injury time."
72,"Prior to the outbreak of bridge-building that occurred in the 19th Century, it was not uncommon for the River Thames to freeze over. One of the earliest recorded occasions was in AD 250 when the river remained under ice for nine weeks. During the 'Little Ice Age', which is usually dated around 1500 - 1850 AD, the whole of Northern Europe experienced markedly cooler conditions and as a result the river froze more frequently.  The process required a long spell of cold, dry weather. Ice patches would initially form near banks and bridges, and grow until they formed solid areas of ice. These would eventually meet up until the river surface was frozen. When the ice was perceived to be thick enough, people would venture onto the ice to hold frost fairs - carnivals on ice that involved dancing, winter games and, most importantly, drinking. It was not uncommon for the freeze to last over three months, as in the case of the winters of 1683 - 1684 and 1715 - 1716.  In 1434, 1506 and 1575 the ice was thick enough to allow people to abandon bridges and drive their carts and carriages across the ice , but there was little in the way of organised entertainment or celebration. The earliest recorded frost fair was in 1564 - 1565, when people congregated on the ice to take part in a football match, archery contests, dancing and feasting. The second similar fair was in 1608 and is depicted in the novel Orlando by Virginia Woolf. It too was unorganised and spontaneous, but the fair of 1683 - 1684 was very different. It lasted from December to early February and was much bigger, creating a mini-London on the ice. Whole streets of booths were constructed across the river between Southwark and Temple, with different trades occupying different areas of the fair. London's entertainments were replicated and Londoners could pass their time drinking watching bear- or bull-baiting, wrestling and horseracing on the ice. Printing presses created souvenirs for visitors and a whole ox was roasted at Hungerford Stairs. Charles II visited, accompanied by his court, and the printed souvenir created for him can be seen at the Museum of London.  The fair of 1814 is the best known and biggest of all London's frost fairs. The freezing process started at the beginning of January after a period of unseasonably mild weather and a week-long fog. The temperature dropped dramatically and, by the end of the month, the ice was thick enough for about 70 brave souls to venture from one bank to the other. Once people realised that the ice between Blackfriars Bridge and Three Crane Stairs was strong enough to hold their weight, they ventured out in their thousands.  By the next day, London traders, who had always been quick to make a penny or two, had turned the whole area into a fair. Rather than the stalls and booths going across the Thames, they ran down the middle and this mall was named the 'City Road'. At first the stalls were quite simple, either selling warming drinks, often alcoholic despite the lack of a licence, or providing a variety of amusements. They were quickly joined by nine printing presses creating frost fair memorabilia. A sheep was roasted on the ice and spectators were charged just to look at it; after it was cooked it was sold as 'Lapland mutton'. As the fair attracted more Londoners, the range of products and activities grew and people clamoured for souvenirs that were marked with 'Frost Fair 1814' and 'Bought on the Thames'. By the end of the week a small herd of donkeys were tempted onto the ice to give rides.  The ice continued to hold, though at the edges there were weak spots. 'Watermen' had to rescue two women who fell through the ice, although a lead-laden plumber who had attempted to cross the ice was, unsurprisingly, less lucky. When the thaw did come, it came quickly. A week after the river had frozen, three people had to be rescued from a large piece of ice that had broken away and by the next day the rise in temperature was indicated by a shower of sleet. This later turned to rain and the ice started to become unstable, sweeping two men down the Thames. The tidal action of the Thames returned and by Sunday huge cracks were appearing in the ice surface. Within 24 hours the ice was quite gone and the river flowing as usual, though the cold weather lasted until late March.  1814 was to prove to be last fair. A new London Bridge was built in 1823 slightly upstream from the old bridge which was eventually demolished in 1831. The structure of the new bridge was less bulky then its predecessor, which had acted as a dam. The demolition of the latter and the narrowing of the river through the creation of the embankments on either side permanently changed the flow of the river. The Thames is now too fast-flowing to freeze over, though there were plans to freeze it as part of the Millennium celebrations using modern technology. The two methods suggested both involved a system of underwater pipes to keep the surface frozen. It was suggested that chemicals could be used to lower the temperature of the river. However, objections were received from the Port of London Authority who were worried about the effect on commercial activity on the river."
73,"Radovan Karadzic is defending himself at the tribunal Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has lost his appeal that war crimes charges against him be dropped. He had appealed against a court ruling made in July that a trial would still be held despite his claim of immunity. But the court ruled that he should have more time to review documents before his trial at The Hague begins. It was due to start on 21 October but could now begin later, as Mr Karadzic has been given five days to review the prosecution's annotated indictment. The prosecution must produce the document by 19 October. Mr Karadzic is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide. The charges relate to the 1995 massacre of about 8,000 men and boys at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war. Mr Karadzic was arrested and brought to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) last year, after more than a decade in hiding. He denies all charges and wanted them dropped on the grounds that he was offered immunity by former US mediator Richard Holbrooke in 1996 if he left public life. The judges ruled on Tuesday: ""Even if the alleged agreement were proved, it would not limit the jurisdiction of the tribunal, it would not otherwise be binding on the tribunal and it would not trigger the doctrine of abuse of process.""

74,"The plans, which could cost up to £6,000, come at a time when Devon County Council is proposing cuts in jobs and services.  Critics have branded the exercise a waste of money.  The council said the simpler design, featuring a pair of leaves to replace the current coat of arms, would save more than £3,000 a year.  The coat of arms features the Latin motto of seafarer Sir Francis Drake: auxilio divino, which means ""by divine aid"".  But the council said the new logo would reflect its new greener image and also save council tax-payers' money.  Peter Doyle, of the council, said: ""Currently, the council's full-colour crest costs us quite a lot of money to reproduce.  ""By using this new simple logo we can save £3,200 a year.""  But the decision to replace the crest has been branded a money-wasting exercise, especially as the council said in February it was raising council tax by 4.9% because it was facing a £15m shortfall in its budget.  Albert Venison of the Devon Pensioners' Action Forum said: ""It's absolutely incredible that we have these sorts of people who are supposed to be looking after the cares and worries of older people, talking about having a new logo.  ""I can tell you the sort of logo I'd like: one with a picture of two hands being held up in horror, saying: '""What are they going to do next?'.""  The new logo is due to be unveiled in April."
75,"A former Army major has told the Saville Inquiry he was satisfied there was a clear gap between rioters and civil rights marchers when the Parachute Regiment was sent into the Bogside area on Bloody Sunday.  However, Major Michael Steele said he did not know how many people were still between the marchers and the rioters.  On 30 January 1972 paratroops opened fire on civilians at a civil rights march in the Bogside in Londonderry killing 13 people. Another man died later.  Major Steele, who passed the orders on the day, was giving evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday.  In 1972 he was working as deputy to the overall Army commander, Brigadier Pat McLellan, and he passed on the brigadier's order for paratroops to go after rioters in the Bogside.  He said the situation was never going to be perfect and that he never believed the area would be completely empty.  Major Steele, who was being fed information from the Army helicopter over the scene, said there was ""wide"" separation"" by the time he passed on the order to move in from Major General MacLellan.  ""There was, in my estimation, a situation where the brigadier's separation between marchers and hooligans had been achieved.""  Major General MacLellan had been seeking a clear split between rioters and marchers at Free Derry Corner, a distance of about 400 metres.  There were also some rioters at Barrier 14 at this point, the inquiry was told.  Major Steele said he had no information on how many people were in Rossville Street, which links the two points and was where the soldiers advanced.  Lord Saville, the inquiry chairman, said it could be viewed that separation had been achieved because rioters and marchers were in different areas.  He said it would then be necessary to mount an arrest operation which did not destroy that separation.  Major Steele said that is why his commanding officer ""very sensibly"" added the demand that there be no running battle to the order - something which had not been previously discussed.  The Saville Inquiry was set up by Prime Minister Tony Blair to reinvestigate the evidence because the relatives felt the first inquiry was a whitewash.  Lord Saville and the Commonwealth judges who comprise the inquiry, are not expected to report back until 2004.  The inquiry is currently hearing the evidence from military witnesses in London."
76,"Engelbert Humperdinck will represent the UK at this year's Eurovision Song Contest, at the age of 75. But who is the man behind the name?  As names go, Engelbert Humperdinck is right up there with the best Dickens has to offer, overshadowing Martin Chuzzlewit, Edwin Drood, even Uriah Heep.  It is a name so wonderfully odd, that it even inspired comedian Eddie Izzard to one ofhis funniest routines.  But rather than literary references, the young Gerry Dorsey looked to classical music for his alias - plumping for a 19th Century composer, best known for his opera Hansel and Gretel.  Born Arnold George Dorsey (later simplified to the stage name Gerry Dorsey) in Chennai, India in 1936, he was 20 years old before the first Eurovision contest was even held.  He released his first single, I'll Never Fall in Love Again, under the name Dorsey, in 1958.  It flopped, and the young singer returned to performing in clubs - until a bout of tuberculosis, in 1961, brought his career to a temporary halt.  In 1965, and still struggling to make an impact on the music scene, Dorsey signed with manager Gordon Mills.  Mills had recently taken another aspiring young singer called Tom Woodward, from Pontypridd in Wales, and renamed him Jones - propelling him toward his first major hit, It's Not Unusual.  Mills persuaded Dorsey that he too needed to change his name if he truly wanted a fresh start, and the artist Engelbert Humperdinck was born.  If the overtly sexual Jones was the fire in the fame-hungry duo, then the reserved, romantic Humperdinck was the ice.  With his square jaw, olive skin and plump lips, not to mention sideburns so ridiculously thick and lustrous they each required a barber of their own - Humperdinck more than matched Jones in the heart-throb stakes.  But it was more than his looks: Humperdinck possessed a smooth, almost effortless croon, which harked back to his idols Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra andDino and the rat pack.  Though he baulked at the term ""crooner"".  ""No crooner has the range I have. I can hit notes a bank could not cash,"" he is reported to have said.  It was a voice that, in 1967, when The Beatles were at the height of their creative powers - about to release the game changing Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band - kept the world's biggest band from the top of the singles chart.  Humperdinck's big band cover of Release Me held off the, not insubstantial, challenge of the Beatles' double A-side Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane for six weeks. It went on to become the highest-selling single of 1967.  Two more ballads, There Goes My Everything and The Last Waltz, drew a wealth of new fans - now nicknamed ""Humperdinckers"", and reputed to include the young Princess Anne.  With a string of successful albums, Humperdinck was one of the pre-eminent balladeers of the 60s, both in the UK and beyond.  Like Jones, he even fronted his own US TV show - though it was cancelled after six months. ""It happens,"" he told chat show host Rosie O'Donnell in a 1996 interview.  In the 1970s, with longer hair and a beard, the broad-shouldered singer resembled a power-lifting Bee Gee.  And in 1976, around the time the Gibbs were themselves about to seize the limelight, Humperdinck recorded another of his biggest hit records, After the Lovin.  The song became a top 10 hit in the US and was nominated for a Grammy, while the album of the same name was another double platinum hit in the States.  However, the single failed to chart in the UK and marked a dip in his popularity on home shores.  Humperdinck, who continued to tour worldwide throughout the 80s and 90s, had something of a UK career revival in the early 2000s following an advert appearance alongside comedian Peter Kaye.  In 2010, it was revealed that Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn had approached Humperdinck to sing on their third studio album Plastic Beach.  Humperdinck's management, unbeknownst to the singer, had rejected the offer.Speaking to the website Undercover News, Humperdinck called it ""the most grievous sin that had ever been committed"".  He added: ""I wouldn't do a thing like that. The Gorillaz? My God! I would jump on it like a ton of bricks"".  Fast forward another couple of years, and, at 75, Humperdinck finds himself at the centre of a major cultural event, representing the UK at this year's Eurovision.  After years of humiliation in the contest for the UK, Humperdinck - who has a large fanbase in eastern Europe - has as good a chance as any other artist to bring the title back to Britain.  ""I'm excited and raring to go and want the nation to get behind me!"" he says."
77,"The celebrity couple recently ran the London Marathon together Katie Price's management company has announced it will no longer represent the former glamour model. Manager Claire Powell, who sometimes appeared in their ITV2 shows, has worked with the star for five years. Powell refused to disclose why Price had been dropped, saying: ""We're a very professional company and I don't want to make any comment."" The decision comes just three days after the former model and Peter Andre said they were separating. Powell revealed she has worked with Andre for longer than Price, first representing him at the beginning of his singing career in the 90s. When he moved to the US, they parted, but she agreed to take him on again in 2003, and ""got him"" on ITV1 reality show I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! a year later. It was during the show that the celebrity couple met and went on to form a relationship. We have worked hard to build Katie as a successful individual and brand    In a statement Can Associates said: ""We have represented Katie since February 2004. ""During that time we have worked hard to build Katie as a successful individual and brand, moving her from a glamour model and repositioning her as the country's foremost female celebrity, with a string of products and successful endorsements. ""We wish Katie every success for the future."" Powell said Andre was currently in Cyprus. She added that she did not know whether Price had sought representation with anyone else. On Monday Can Associates issued a joint statement on behalf of the couple announcing their separation. Later that day Price issued another statement through a separate PR company. ""Pete is the love of my life and my life. We have children together and I am devastated and disappointed by his decision to separate and divorce me, as I married him for life,"" she said. ""This is not what I want and the decision has been taken out of my hands.""     "
78,"Plans are being drawn up to bring a decommissioned warship back to Edinburgh as a tourist attraction.  Independent MSP Margo MacDonald has organised a meeting to discuss the idea of locating HMS Edinburgh in the Scottish capital.  She said such a move would be a great boost to the city's economy.  The Ministry of Defence said no final decision had been made on what to do with the ship, which was decommissioned earlier this month.  The 30-year-old vessel was the largest of the Type 42 destroyers, and patrolled the Falklands, the Far East and the Baltic during the second Gulf War.  HMS Edinburgh - which underwent a £17.5m refit in 2010 - was decommissioned two weeks ago, with her role being taken up by the new state-of-the-art Type 45 destroyers.  Ms MacDonald has organised a meeting to discuss the plans for the vessel.  She wants to see it brought back to Edinburgh and tied up alongside the Royal Yacht Britannia.  Thursday's meeting will be chaired by Lord Provost Donald Wilson and will be attended by businessman Sir Tom Farmer, senior representatives from the city council and Forth Ports authority."
79,"Sat-nav will become ubiquitous in mobile phones A German/UK consortium has been asked to supply the first operational spacecraft for Europe's Galileo satellite-navigation system. OHB System and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) will build 14 satellites in a contract valued at 566m euros ($811m; £510m). The contract was announced by the European Commission in Brussels. Galileo is intended as an EU version of the US Global Positioning System (GPS), but with significant improvements. Its more advanced technology should give users quicker, more reliable fixes, and enable them to locate their positions with an error of one metre compared with the current GPS error of several metres. European Commission vice-president with responsibility for transport, Antonio Tajani, also announced contracts to purchase the rockets on which to launch the satellites, and system management to oversee the Galileo project implementation. ""With this and the upcoming awards for the remaining procurement packages, we are concluding a critical phase of the Galileo programme,"" he said. ""We can now focus on the actual roll-out and demonstrate to European citizens that Europe's own satellite-navigation system is firmly underway."" The total value of the contracts announced on Thursday is just over one billion euros. The contracts mean Galileo, which has been much delayed, should finally become operational in early 2014. At least 22 satellites to launch in batches in coming years Will work alongside US GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises real-time positioning down to less than a metre Guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances Suitable for safety-critical roles where lives depend on service ""Our schedule has the satellites rolling off the end of the production line in the second half of 2012,"" said Phil Davies from SSTL. ""We then fall into a steady state where we produce a satellite every six weeks or so. The first two will be ready for launch in October 2012,"" he told BBC News. Arianespace of France will launch the spacecraft. The value of its contract amounts to 397m euros ($569m; £358m). Arianespace will use Russian-built Soyuz rockets initially to send up the spacecraft in batches of two. By early 2014, it is thought there could be up to 16 spacecraft in the Galileo network, enough to make a significant difference to sat-nav users with Galileo and GPS-enabled receivers. Thales Alenia Space of Italy has been asked to provide the system support to pull the whole project together. Its contract is valued at 85m euros ($122m; £77m). Galileo should have been operational by now but the project has run into myriad technical, commercial and political obstacles, including early objections from the Americans who thought a rival system to GPS might be used to attack its armed forces. The first satellites will be launched in pairs on Soyuz rockets The venture came very close to being abandoned in 2007 when the public-private development-and-business model set up to build and run the system collapsed. To keep Galileo alive, EU member-states had to agree to fund the entire project from the public purse. What should have cost European taxpayers no more than 1.8bn euros will now probably cost them in excess of 5bn euros. The EU's continued commitment to the project despite severe budgetary and management failings is based on the belief that huge returns to the European economy will accrue from the investment. Already, GPS is said to have spawned global markets that are worth several tens of billions of euros annually. The new European constellation is expected to deepen and extend those markets as sat-nav functionality becomes ubiquitous in consumer devices such as mobile phones. Thursday's contracts are just the start of operational roll-out of Galileo. More satellites and rockets will be needed. There are also outstanding work packages that need to be awarded, for the ground control segments of Galileo. The three major contracts in this area should be awarded by mid-2010. THE GALILEO SYSTEM WILL HAVE FIVE SERVICES This will be 'free to air' and for use by the mass market; Simple timing and positioning down to 1m Encrypted; High accuracy at the cm scale; Guaranteed service for which service providers will charge fees Open service; For applications where guaranteed accuracy is essential; Integrity messages will warn of errors Encrypted; Continuous availability even in time of crisis; Government agencies will be main users System will pick up distress beacon locations; Feasible to send feedback, confirming help is on its way     "
80,"On 15 August, 2004, Atefah Sahaaleh was hanged in a public square in the Iranian city of Neka.  Her death sentence was imposed for ""crimes against chastity"".  The state-run newspaper accused her of adultery and described her as 22 years old.  But she was not married - and she was just 16.  In terms of the number of people executed by the state in 2004, Iran is estimated to be second only to China.  In the year of Atefah's death, at least 159 people were executed in accordance with the Islamic law of the country, based on the Sharia code.  Since the revolution, Sharia law has been Iran's highest legal authority.  Alongside murder and drug smuggling, sex outside marriage is also a capital crime.  As a signatory of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, Iran has promised not to execute anyone under the age of 18.  But the clerical courts do not answer to parliament. They abide by their religious supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, making it virtually impossible for human rights campaigners to call them to account.  At the time of Atefah's execution in Neka, journalist Asieh Amini heard rumours the girl was just 16 years old and so began to ask questions.  ""When I met with the family,"" says Asieh, ""they showed me a copy of her birth certificate, and a copy of her death certificate. Both of them show she was born in 1988. This gave me legitimate grounds to investigate the case.""  So why was such a young girl executed? And how could she have been accused of adultery when she was not even married?  Disturbed by the death of her mother when she was only four or five years old, and her distraught father's subsequent drug addiction, Atefah had a difficult childhood.  She was also left to care for her elderly grandparents, but they are said to have shown her no affection.  In a town like Neka, heavily under the control of religious authorities, Atefah - often seen wandering around on her own - was conspicuous.  It was just a matter of time before she came to the attention of the ""moral police"", a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, whose job it is to enforce the Islamic code of behaviour on Iran's streets.  Being stopped or arrested by the moral police is a fact of life for many Iranian teenagers.  Previously arrested for attending a party and being alone in a car with a boy, Atefah received her first sentence for ""crimes against chastity"" when she was just 13.  Although the exact nature of the crime is unknown, she spent a short time in prison and received 100 lashes.  When she returned to her home town, she told those close to her that lashes were not the only things she had to endure in prison. She described abuse by the moral police guards.  Soon after her release, Atefah became involved in an abusive relationship with a man three times her age.  Former revolutionary guard, 51-year-old Ali Darabi - a married man with children - raped her several times.  She kept the relationship a secret from both her family and the authorities.  Atefah was soon caught in a downward spiral of arrest and abuse.  The moral police said the locals had submitted a petition, describing her as a ""source of immorality"" and a ""terrible influence on local schoolgirls"".  But there were no signatures on the petition - only those of the arresting guards.  Three days after her arrest, Atefah was in a court and tried under Sharia law.  The judge was the powerful Haji Rezai, head of the judiciary in Neka.  No court transcript is available from Atefah's trial, but it is known that for the first time, Atefah confessed to the secret of her sexual abuse by Ali Darabi.  However, the age of sexual consent for girls under Sharia law - within the confines of marriage - is nine, and furthermore, rape is very hard to prove in an Iranian court.  ""Men's word is accepted much more clearly and much more easily than women,"" according to Iranian lawyer and exile Mohammad Hoshi.  ""They can say: 'You know she encouraged me' or 'She didn't wear proper dress'.""  When Atefah realised her case was hopeless, she shouted back at the judge and threw off her veil in protest.  She was sentenced to execution by hanging, while Darabi got just 95 lashes.  Shortly before the execution, but unbeknown to her family, documents that went to the Supreme Court of Appeal described Atefah as 22.  ""Neither the judge nor even Atefah's court appointed lawyer did anything to find out her true age,"" says her father.  And a witness claims: ""The judge just looked at her body, because of the developed physique... and declared her as 22.""  Judge Haji Rezai took Atefah's documents to the Supreme Court himself.  And at six o'clock on the morning of her execution he put the noose around her neck, before she was hoisted on a crane to her death.  During the making of the documentary about Atefah's death the production team telephoned Judge Haji Rezai to ask him about the case, but he refused to comment.  The human rights organisation Amnesty International says it is concerned that executions are becoming more common again under President Mahmoud Ahmedinajad, who advocates a return to the pure values of the revolution.  The judiciary have never admitted there was any mishandling of Atefah's case.  For Atefah's father the pain of her death remains raw. ""She was my love, my heart... I did everything for her, everything I could,"" he says.  He did not get the chance to say goodbye."

82,"Police have used riot gear for the first time since the miners' strike began three months ago. Police have used riot gear for the first time since the miners' strike began three months ago. Forming the biggest picket of the strike so far, at least 5,000 miners gathered outside Orgreave coking plant near Sheffield. The intimidation and the brutality that has been displayed are something reminiscent of a Latin American state   They were met by police from ten counties. Altogether, 41 police officers and 28 strikers were injured. During fierce clashes with police 81 people were arrested. Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Miners, had called on miners to picket the plant to try and stop British Steel's coke convoys. He stood among his men as hundreds of police formed lines around the miners to try to stop them getting to the coke lorries. Trouble broke out when pickets spotted the first convoy at about 0900 BST. They surged forward and there were running battles with police on horseback. Smoke bombs, bricks, stones and ball-bearings were thrown and fencing torn up. Ambulance men wearing protective headgear led casualties away to safety. Both sides pinned the blame on each other. ""We've had riot shields, we've had riot gear, we've had police on horseback charging into our people, we've had people hit with truncheons and people kicked to the ground."" said Mr Scargill. ""The intimidation and the brutality that has been displayed are something reminiscent of a Latin American state."" South Yorkshire Chief Constable Peter Wright said officers had to wear protective helmets and use shields to allow the gates of the factory to remain open. Mr Scargill is hoping to repeat the success of 12 years ago, when his pickets stopped coke deliveries at Saltley gasworks in Birmingham in his struggle to improve the lot of British miners. But this time he seems to have failed - the 34 lorry drivers today managed to make two journeys unhindered and say they are determined to continue the coke runs.     The miners' dispute began on 6 March 1984 when the head of the National Coal Board, Ian McGregor, announced plans to cut production, the equivalent of 20 pits or 20,000 jobs. Arthur Scargill called on miners to strike as they had done successfully in 1972 and 1974. But his refusal to hold a ballot lost him the support of other unions. Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative government would not be defeated this time and had a concerted plan of action. Coal was stockpiled and imported and a National Reporting Centre was set up to co-ordinate Britain's regional police force. This allowed officers to be deployed quickly to trouble spots to tackle Mr Scargill's flying pickets, sent all over the country to persuade workers to down tools. On-off talks between an uncompromising Arthur Scargill and the NCB came to nothing. The pickets failed to stop or even restrict power supplies to the nation."
83,"The unmarked Shevchenko stretched to head home Salomon Kalou's cross from close in for Chelsea's first.  The Black Cats worked tirelessly to keep Chelsea at bay in the second half but failed to trouble Carlo Cudicini.  Lampard made the game safe from the spot after Danny Higginbotham had tugged Alex's shirt, before Liam Miller saw red for a push on Claudio Pizarro.  Chelsea will be steeling themselves for a spate of bruising encounters over Christmas and this flattening of one of the Premier League's featherweights moved them closer to pacesetters Arsenal and Manchester United.  But the Blues will go through a key part of the season without their talismanic striker Didier Drogba, who underwent a knee operation earlier on Saturday.  The Ivory Coast forward boasts more goals this season than Saturday's front two Kalou and Shevchenko put together.  But the former came close to adding to his three league goals when he deflected Joe Cole's corner onto the bar after five minutes.  And just 15 minutes later, the Ivorian picked out his unmarked strike partner Shevchenko who dived to head home from five yards.  The hosts deserved more from a first half that they completely dominated.  Black Cats boss Roy Keane indicated before the game that he was willing to ""park the bus"" in front of his side's goal and Kenwyne Jones was isolated up front, feeding on scraps and mistakes.  Cudicini's only test of the first half was to gather Jones' bobbling low drive, while Darren Ward, again keeping Craig Gordon out of the side, was regularly peppered with crosses and half chances.  As the rain lashed down in the second half, Chelsea poured forward, swamping the visitors' defence and breaking up sporadic counter-attacks.  Sunderland worked hard to limit the home side's clear-cut chances, with Paul McShane and Higginbotham tirelessly chasing down runs and blocking shots.  And as their confidence grew, Jones became more involved and he glanced a header wide from a tight angle.  Halford had a long range effort comfortably saved by Cudicini and substitute Daryl Murphy flashed an effort wide from 25 yards.  But when Higginbotham pulled Alex's shirt inside the box, Lampard drilled home the penalty to put Chelsea out of sight.  Miller's late dismissal for pushing Pizarro just yards from the referee completed Keane's miserable afternoon.  ""It was not easy to play against Sunderland because they defended cleverly with a lot of men.  ""It was a very mature performance because we looked for opportunities to find the second goal which we got in the second half with a penalty.""  ""It was fairly poor defending for the first as we didn't stop the cross coming in and a striker like Andriy Shevchenko won't miss from there.  ""When it's 1-0 you're in with a chance but the second goal killed the game."""
84,"Atoc says record demand has led to the need for investment Train operators are calling for widespread expansion of the rail network in England, with 14 extra lines and about 40 new stations proposed. The Association of Train Operating Companies said there was a need for expansion to cope with rising demand. It said the expansion, which would cost £500m and possibly reuse lines closed under the 1960s Beeching cuts, could serve more than 1m extra passengers. Any decisions on future expansion rest with government and Network Rail. Atoc chief executive Michael Roberts said: ""Record passenger numbers and rising demand require us to plan for the long term, while climate change and population growth make it vital that in doing so, we adapt the rail network to meet tomorrow's needs. Any expansion should be publicly-owned and free from the chaos and profiteering of the privatised franchise system    ""Providing attractive new services and easier access to the rail network will encourage passengers to switch to rail from other, less green, modes of transport. ""We have established that there is a strong business case for investment to bring a number of towns back on to the rail network. ""Now we need to safeguard these routes and develop the detailed case for investment."" The Beeching report by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s resulted in the railway network being cut by a third, closing 2,000 stations and 5,000 miles of track. The Atoc report says 40 towns not currently on the rail network could benefit from the 14 new lines. It says the new stations could be operational within five to 10 years. Any decision on whether any of the plans get the go-ahead would be taken by local and regional government, Network Rail and the Department for Transport. Atoc argues infrastructure from some of the old lines closed in the 1960s could be refurbished to form part of the new network. Freight lines could also be adapted to serve commercial routes, it said. Transport Minister Chris Mole said the government would consider the findings of Atoc's report. ""The government's priority is to bring about changes, such as capacity improvements, which will deliver benefits for rail passengers now,"" he said. ""For the longer term, we will work with local authorities who want to improve links to the rail network, and will plan to make funding available from 2014 for successful schemes which demonstrate value for money."" Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers said the research was ""interesting"" and made ""an impressive case"" for reopening disused rail lines. She added: ""Conservatives recognise the value of these transport corridors, which is why we have called for a moratorium on building on any disused rail lines still in public ownership. ""Certainly, housing growth and the need to cut emissions from transport and tackle road congestion means that all political parties should look seriously at the ideas put forward in this report, though it is clear that the state of the public finances will put constraints on what is possible over the next few years."" Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said: ""RMT has repeatedly called for an expansion of rail services to create green jobs and green transport options as part of our campaign for a people's railways. ""However, any expansion should be publicly-owned and free from the chaos and profiteering of the privatised franchise system.""    The areas which would be served by the 14 possible new lines identified in the report are: • Aldridge and Brownhills in the West Midlands • Leicester to Burton in the East Midlands     "
85,"The North Pennines is an area of outstanding natural beauty, covering 772 square miles.  This wilderness area is one of the country's last expanses of wilderness, a high wild landscape of undulating heather moorland and blanket peat.  The North Pennines spans three counties - Northumberland County Durham and Cumbria, and comprises moorlands, wooded valleys and small, unspoilt villages.  The area has a rich abundance of minerals, and was once an important location for lead, zinc, iron, fluorspar, barytes, witherite and coal mining.  In 2003, the North Pennines was awarded European Geopark Status, a designation for areas with world-class geology.  Parts of the area are protected as National Nature Reserves and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.      Man's influence has also moulded the landscape, with farming and mining. The largest towns in this remote area are Allendale, Alston, Blanchland and Haltwhistle."
86,"Much of the evidence was lost to sea the report said A blaze which destroyed the pavilion of Weston-super-Mare's Grand Pier was probably started by an electrical fault in the north east tower. However an official report by Avon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service concluded the official cause of the blaze would be recorded as unknown. It ruled out arson but said the job was made much harder because much of the evidence had been lost to the sea. In a statement the owners of the pier thanked the brigade for its efforts. Co-owner Kerry Michael said: ""Michelle and I would like to thank the fire brigade and forensic scientists for all their efforts on the day and for their diligent interrogation into the possible causes of the fire. ""Whilst it has not been possible to confirm the cause with any certainty, it is somewhat reassuring to know that certain things have been ruled out, for example speculation suggesting a kitchen fire have been laid to rest."" The blaze is the second time the pier has burned down; the first was in 1930 when the rebuilding process took three years. Then it took three years for the pavilion to be rebuilt. At a news conference on Wednesday Avon Fire and Rescue said after trawling through CCTV footage, taking eye-witness accounts and examining the scene, its investigation was inconclusive. Deputy chief fire officer Jerry O'Brien said: ""Taking into consideration evidence provided by eye witnesses CCTV images, firefighters and a detailed scene examination, the cause of this fire will therefore officially be recorded as unknown."" Mr O'Brien said arson was unlikely as there was ""no evidence of forced entry or use of accelerants"". He said the most likely cause was ""an electrical fault of unknown origin above ground floor level in the north east corner of the Pavilion - where the fire started but the investigation did not provide enough evidence for this to be a conclusive finding."" ""A number of potential causes were identified, meticulously analysed and systematically discounted by forensic experts during the investigation. ""It is therefore considered unlikely the fire was caused by carelessly discarded smoking materials, electrical cooking or heating appliances, self-heating of cooking substances, a gas supply or source of naked flame."" Mr O'Brien said the fire service may have had a better chance of defeating the blaze if an alarm triggered at 0135 BST was brought to its attention. ""The alarm - which went off five hours before the service was alerted - was connected to an alarm monitoring company which failed to contact Avon Fire and Rescue Service."" The quarter-of-a-mile-long pier, which attracts thousands of visitors a year, reopened in April after a massive revamp. It first opened in 1904 and was later bought by the Brenner family who sold it in a multi-million pound deal in February to brother and sister Michelle and Kerry Michael. The Michaels had already spent £1m installing a go-kart track, a climbing wall and bar before the blaze. ""Now that the fire report has been published it enables us to close that chapter and move on with the important job of rebuilding the pavilion,"" said Kerry Michael. ""We are looking forward to provide a state-of-the-art 21st Century facility for our town. ""Our vision is that along with the redevelopment of the Tropicana, this can form a catalyst for the regeneration of the town.""     "
87,"One of Britain's greatest motor racing drivers has been killed in a plane crash in south-east England.  Graham Hill, 46, who retired from the sport in July 1975, was killed instantly along with the four other occupants in his Piper Aztec - all members of the Embassy Hill team.  Hill was piloting the plane when he clipped a row of trees on Arkley golf course in Hertfordshire, just before 2200 GMT.  The two-times world champion was flying Embassy Hill manager Ray Brimble, fellow driver Tony Brise, and two mechanics from France to attend a party in London.  Arley Golf Club steward Ted Dickins said visibility had been very poor at the time of the accident.  ""It was terrible - the ambulances couldn't even see the bunkers as they were driving down,"" he said.  Friend and Elstree Aero Club chairman Spencer Flack said the champion driver was taking a risk by trying to land in bad conditions but told reporters he was an experienced flier.  ""He was a skilful pilot who tried to get in and failed.  ""In those conditions it's just a matter of feet and seconds between life and death,"" he said.  Government accident investigation officials are sifting through the wreckage to try to establish the cause of the crash.  Hill is the only driver to have won the Triple Crown of the Indianapolis 500, the 24 hours of Le Mans and the Formula One World Championship.  He won the world title with BRM in 1962 and again in 1968, with Lotus.  Hill retired from Formula 1 mid-season so he could concentrate on coaching Brise, a promising new driver in his own fledgling team Embassy Hill."
88,"Based on the hit novel by John King of the same name, Brit flick The Football Factory takes a no holds barred look at working class male culture through the eyes of four different generations. Directed by Nick Love, the film stars an all British cast featuring rising stars Danny Dyer and Tamer Hassan. Thanks to a rough pirate copy doing the rounds, the film is already causing a buzz before it is even released! What drew you to bring John King's novel onto the big screen? Nick: The book came out in 1997 and I tried to buy the rights to it then. I just thought it was a very under represented culture phenomenon. It's the kind of thing that has gone on in England since the 70s. The rights went to the highest bidder and I walked away from it. Then, it came back to me at the very beginning of last year with some people who had a very small amount of money, about half a million quid, who said 'listen, we've got the money to make this film, do you want to do it?' It was a question of adapting the script... I wrote the script in four days and shot it straight away.     The book has little to do with football and more to do with people in tribes, whether it be north v south, race, class etc. Was that difficult to portray on screen? Nick: Yeah, film is a very difficult medium. As an auteur, looking at something and going 'right this is the book and I'm going to make the film - now how am I going to do that?' It's a quite daunting sort of thing to do because the book has sold nearly 300,000 copies and is very well loved, very passionate book for the football terrace male culture. It's the first real book of its kind. The first thing I thought was keep the elements of the book so it feels like the book but absolutely do my own thing.    So why did you cast Danny Dyer and Tamer Hassan in the film? Nick: The film was cast before I wrote the script. These two were in it before they even auditioned. I think if you are making a film about a subject like this which has to be absolutely believable, you can only cast people, who aren't football thugs - Danny and Tamer aren't football thugs, but they have a real understanding about male culture, tribalism and hierarchy. There is nothing animated in it because every character is 100% as they are in real life They have such gravitas as actors. For years these sorts of films weren't getting made. It's quite hard to act and be natural, but when you have parts that are almost written for you, you can really be yourself in it. Tamer: When I met Nick, I met him on the set of The Calcium Kid and we sort of clicked straight away. There is nothing animated in it because every character is 100% as they are in real life. Why did you sign up to play Tommy Johnson, Danny? Danny: When they first wanted to make this film Nick wasn't attached to it. It was a totally different script, I auditioned for it and didn't get it. Then Nick came along, I got a reprieve and got the job. Did you have to research the parts? Tamer: Nah, we're passionate supporters, especially for me - I'm a Millwall fan. At the end of the day, I've owned nightclubs, restaurants and have come across real thugs. I used to go to football with the main boys from Millwall. For me research wasn't an issue. Tommy Johnson is a football thug. How do you make a character like that likeable? Danny: It was important to me that I put that across. You really need to care about Tommy by the end of the film. You have to make him endearing even though he's running about swearing and being violent. There's also the underlying thing where he is quite sensitive and is thinking about things.    Nick: Every character has something about them.. Millwall Fred (Tamer) - he's likeable because he's so big, all of his dialogue is so good, he's got a good face, such a presence. You watch Tamer's character and you think back it's mad you like him - he's an out and out bully thug but he has some sort of charm about him. I tried to give every character something that the audience can empathise with.    What has the reaction been from the gangs that are portrayed in The Football Factory? Tamer: All of them have seen the film and they absolutely love it. In the film you've got a range of football supporters Chelsea, West Ham, Millwall and Tottenham and they've all mixed together to play Chelsea firm. Whatever football club they support, they love it. Everywhere we go, people are like 'Football Factory- what a great film'. I go onto the terraces in Millwall and I'm like a celebrity.    Nick: The reason for that is an incomplete pirate DVD of the film got out last year and from one DVD it's turned into an epidemic. Tens of thousands of copies are going up and down the country. The thing is the pirate is only one tenth of the real film, it's missing voiceover, music, and credits. A lot of people have seen the pirate and love it. Has the pirate version helped create a buzz around the film?    Danny: Yeah, people are going mad for the DVD. Tamer: I think so, but the actual film is very different and has added scenes. Nick: Part of me wishes I had thought of it myself as it has been a great bit of underground marketing.     Music plays a big part in The Football Factory... Nick: When you make a film that people are interested to see, it makes life really easy. Mike Skinner (The Streets) came to see the film and wanted to give us a song for nothing. Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie saw the film and wanted to give us a song. So when everyone wants to be in the film, it's a real good footing.    The film features a couple of gang fight scenes- were they difficult to co-ordinate? Tamer: Shooting the last scene, everyone knew everyone on set. It was favours of goodwill all over. We were all on the phone asking people if they wanted to be in the scene. They were all Millwall supporters, turning up in their droves. Danny's side were all actors, but for me it was hard work - the hardest day's work I've ever done. I had 50 to 60 non-actors. It was a great experience.    What's next for you all? Nick: We're all off to the Costa del Sol. We're doing a film set in the 1980s about the rise and fall of the British crimewave in the Costa del Sol. It's called 'The Business'"
89,"The England defender rifled home a left-foot finish on 87 minutes after being set up by Eidur Gudjohnsen to end Arsenal's unbeaten run against Chelsea.  In an enthralling match, Jose Antonio Reyes fired Arsenal into the lead from close range in first-half injury time.  But Frank Lampard drew the Blues level after a Jens Lehmann error before Bridge sealed a famous win.  Arsenal, with Thierry Henry and Reyes back in the starting line-up, were pegged back in the opening minutes.  But Lampard had the only real sight of goal, firing straight into the body of Lehmann.  And in between yellow cards for Chelsea's William Gallas and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Henry fashioned his first sight of goal and smacked a fierce right-foot shot just over.  An even better chance followed on 18 minutes after Reyes' clever through pass, but the Frenchman's shot drifted wide.  Damien Duff nearly put Chelsea ahead in sensational fashion on 20 minutes, breaking clear and cutting inside Sol Campbell before sending the ball inches wide.  Henry saw a sidefooted shot blocked and a header across goal cleared, before Robert Pires headed Ashley Cole's cross into the side netting.  Then a beautiful pass from Henry found Pires who set up Cole - but the England man's shot was blocked.  Yet just as Chelsea looked to go in at half-time all square, Reyes scored with the last kick of the half.  Lauren's probing cross was headed back across goal by Henry and although Freddie Ljungberg was unable to get a touch, the ball fell to Reyes who slotted home between Marco Ambrosio's legs from close range.  Jesper Gronkjaer replaced Scott Parker at half-time as Claudio Ranieri looked to boost Chelsea's attacking options.  The change seemed to work as Chelsea celebrated an equaliser within six minutes of the restart.  And the England man was holding his head moments later after a beautiful 25-yard strike which curled into the side netting with Lehmann beaten.  It was little more than Chelsea deserved for their battling response to Reyes' goal, but with the scores all level, both sides became understandably cautious.  Reyes still looked lively, however, and a left-foot shot was pushed away by Ambrosio.  The Italian keeper had to be alert to tip away Toure's 40-yard effort shortly afterwards.  With 10 minutes remaining, Dennis Bergkamp came on for Henry for Arsenal, while Chelsea brought Joe Cole and Hernan Crespo for Duff and Hasselbaink.  Chelsea pressed again, and Ashley Cole made a fantastic goal-line clearance at full stretch from Gudjohnsen as the home side's defence disintegrated on 85 minutes.  But Bridge popped up two minutes later with a classy left-foot finish after a perfect one-two with Gudjohnsen to stun Arsenal.  Arsenal: Lehmann, Lauren, Campbell, Toure, Cole, Ljungberg, Edu, Vieira, Pires, Henry (Bergkamp 81), Reyes.    Subs Not Used: Stack, Keown, Wiltord, Silva, Clichy, Kanu."
90,"The decision by the National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) was made in record time following an emotional campaign, and a number of high profile court cases.  It all began in May last year.  That is when US doctors indicated a trial of Herceptin on early stage breast cancers had been promising - and was also when Professor Lisa Jardine received a call.  She had been suffering from breast cancer, and had written that she might benefit from Herceptin.  She said: ""I was phoned within a day by somebody who asked if I would like help in getting my health service trust to get me Herceptin prior to NICE's authorising of it.  ""I asked who this person was, and they told me they worked for a PR company working for Roche (which makes Herceptin).  ""I was rather obviously outraged that the pharmaceutical company should be trying to persuade me to go public in trying to get the drug - which incidentally my hospital would have given me, should I have wanted it - and I hung the phone up.""  In a statement, it said: ""Lisa Jardine, as a public figure who had spoken openly about her own disease, was contacted in the planning stages of activity to raise awareness of the importance of accurate breast cancer diagnosis.  ""This activity was never conducted, as it was superseded by a Department of Health initiative to encourage wider tumour type testing.""  Just a couple of weeks later, a woman did go public on Herceptin. There is no indication the drug company helped though.  Barbara Clark is a former nurse whose primary care trust would not prescribe Herceptin for her early stage breast cancer.  In June she told reporters she would sell her house to buy the drug herself - but three months later she was threatening legal action instead.  Her PCT finally said it would give her the drug - because of her exceptional circumstances.  But she wanted all woman with the same cancer to have the same chance.  At the time she said: ""Those women when they've gone through their chemotherapy and radiotherapy will get their Herceptin. But what about the others like me?""  More women came forward. They too were suffering from early stage breast cancer and their primary care trusts would not prescribe Herceptin.  They too threatened to shame their local health authorities, either by selling their homes, or by taking their trusts to court.  Amongst them, was Elaine Barber from Stoke. She was finally told she could have the drug after an intervention by the Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt.  That same month, in the US, the results of the trials were published.  They suggested that Herceptin could halve the chances of recurrence in early stage cancers.  The results were described as stunning by some.  However, Dr Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet medical journal, expressed concern.  He said there were key gaps in the evidence of the effectiveness of the drug - and question marks about whether it might in some circumstances damage the heart.  However, NICE, which has looked closely at the evidence, has now given the green light for Herceptin to be used for early breast cancer.  She says its been used for early stage cancers in other countries.  But she has doubts about the way NICE reached its decision.  ""I worried we were being rushed by patients.  ""Patients are not, alas, in the end the best judges of what is best for the community of sufferers as a whole.""  Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, dismissed concerns that the assessment process had been rushed.  He said it was coincidental that Herceptin was among the first group of drugs to be considered under a new fast-track assessment system.  ""We have introduced this new process precisely because we want to make sure that for potentially very exciting new interventions we are in a position to give advice to the NHS very quickly after that new drug gets its licence.""  Mr Dillon said the drug would not have been approved if the evidence had suggested it was not effective or cost-effective.  ""The people who sit on our independent advisory committees are not for pushing around by anybody.  ""What they have come with today is entirely the product of their independent, reasoned interpretation of the evidence.""  He said Dr Horton's concerns had been addressed by the full details of the clinical trials.  Mr Dillon said it was important for drug companies to minimise the amount of time taken to apply for a licence for potentially significant new drugs - particularly once public interest had been stimulated."
91,"But the team finishing third in the Premier League will now go straight into the group stages and the fourth team will face two qualifying rounds.  There will also be more places for champions of lower ranked nations if the proposals are ratified next month.  And this will mean a place in the group stage for Scotland's champions in 2009.  But with fewer spots available for qualifiers the team finishing fourth in the Premier League will now face a tougher qualification process.  Platini's most controversial proposal was for domestic cup winners to play off for the places that currently go to the teams finishing fourth in the top European leagues, but this idea has been dropped.  Platini had outlined his plans to Uefa's European Professional Football Strategy Council, a 16-member group comprising of officials from Europe's leagues, associations and clubs in Nyon, Switzerland.  The new changes will be ratified at Uefa's executive committee meeting in Lucerne on 1 December.  BBC sports editor Mihir Bose said: ""Platini wanted the new club champions to come in from the less privileged parts of Europe.  ""He has got that part of the plan through - six new clubs will come in.  ""But the other part of the proposal, which involved the cup winners, has been completely abandoned.""  The meeting's other significant outcome was the automatic qualification of the team finishing third in the top leagues, including the Premier League.  ""The Premier League has won a thumping victory over Platini,"" added Bose.  The plan had been opposed by the G14, the body which represents 18 of Europe's leading clubs including Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal, who said any change would devalue the reputation of the Champions League.  Their view was backed by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.  ""You have to be careful not to change the Champions League too much by bringing in even more weaker teams because you could find yourself with games with no meaning,"" he said.  ""That would be very dangerous for the quality of the competition."""
92,"Although a number of Scottish banks issue notes they are not backed by the force of law anywhere in the UK.  Des Browne told MPs at Westminster it was an ""irritation"" but Scots should keep insisting the notes were good.  His comments came after the issue was raised at Scottish Questions by Liberal Democrat MP Malcolm Bruce.  The only notes that carry the force of law are those issued by the Bank of England.  Mr Bruce, the MP for Gordon, told the Commons: ""It is high time that Scottish bank notes were legally acceptable throughout the UK.  ""They are authorised by the Bank of England and should have exactly the same status.  ""If dollars and euros are acceptable to traders, surely Scottish notes should be.""  Mr Browne insisted Scottish notes enjoyed exactly the same status as all other methods of payment under law.  However, he added: ""I know some of my fellow countrymen have experienced, on occasion, the refusal of these bank notes.  ""But I have been in London a lot over the last 11 years and because of ministerial responsibilities I have also had Northern Irish bank notes sometimes in my wallet and I have never experienced anyone refusing to accept them.""  Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael told MPs newspaper research had shown that Scottish bank notes were often not accepted.  Mr Browne replied: ""The fundamental problem here is that the law of contract across the United Kingdom allows people not to engage in a transaction at the point of payment if they don't want to.  ""This irritation in the 21st Century shouldn't be here. The best thing to do is to take every opportunity to tell people that these notes are as good as anybody else's and should be accepted."""

Science is changing the world at an extraordinary pace.  “The campaign will connect audiences with the brightest minds and institutions in science and technology, producing more than 40 hours of television, a range of programmes across our radio networks, a series of podcasts, and digital offerings, made in collaboration with partners, including the Science Museum Group, Wellcome, The Open University and the Royal Society.”  To engage people who want to know more and debate these topics, the digital hub at www.bbc.co.uk/tomorrowsworld, will feature a range of content made by our partners and the BBC. This is the first time a digital space will have been recreated to bring the most respected science institutions from across the UK together. Curated daily, it will reflect interest in the broadcasts, topical events and social media.  The hub will also offer short films, a series of citizen science opportunities to engage with the audience, interactive calculators and many other interactive features. Our goal is to leverage digital engagement and scientific expertise to encourage a greater and more profound understanding of science in the wider public. The content will take the Tomorrow’s World themes such as contagion; artificial intelligence; sleep; and use science to help people better understand themselves  There will also be Twitter Q&As with some of Britain’s most eminent scientists; online debates about the biggest scientific questions of our time; and a Facebook community where even the most colossal concepts are accessible, relevant and personal.  Taken together, this creates a truly ground-breaking season of science, that is relevant to peoples’ lives, and enables them to engage with the big topics of the present and future.  Ian Blatchford, Director of the Science Museum Group says: “The marriage of our world-class collections, expertise and rich programming with the BBC’s worldwide reach is a truly exciting prospect. The Tomorrow's World partnership is already bearing fruit with Britain’s Greatest Inventions, a 90-minute live broadcast from our stores that will air on BBC Two. The BBC’s TV cameras have been granted exclusive access to our stores to explore our incredible objects and reveal the stories of some of the greatest inventions in history.”  Simon Chaplin, Director of Culture and Society, Wellcome, says: “Public engagement is crucial to our mission to improve health for everyone and we’re delighted to be working with the BBC and our collaborators on Tomorrow’s World on a project which makes science accessible and contemporary. As an organisation which supports scientists and researchers to take on big ideas, we know that working together makes great things possible. Wellcome will be creating original content which will bring different perspectives to themes including mental health, sleep and contagion based on current research and recent discoveries. These are some of the key health issues of our time and we are looking forward to creating content which starts conversations and uses new voices.”  Venki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society, says: “We live in a world in which our lives are increasingly shaped by science and technology, from keeping us healthy and connected to creating jobs. The pace of change can be dizzying and all of us need to understand the basis of how decisions are made by both corporations and governments on issues of science and technology. It is also great fun to explore the nature of the world around us. Tomorrow’s World is all about linking enquiring minds with trusted sources of knowledge in an engaging and enjoyable way.”  Dr Caroline Ogilvie, Head of Broadcast and Partnerships at The Open University says: “The OU has been at the forefront of creating and producing engaging content to inspire people to learn about STEM subjects. We are delighted to be part of the Tomorrow's World partnership and campaign.”  Tom McDonald, Head of Commissioning, Science and Specialist Factual, says: “Science broadcasting has an extraordinary history at the BBC. I'm delighted we're continuing the legacy of Tomorrow's World with this brilliant range of titles. They underline our commitment to innovation within science programming and our commitment to working with the very best science communicators and experts in the UK and beyond. These titles sit at the heart of the BBC's year of science and are possible only because of the strength of our partnerships and our relationships with the best producers of science content in the UK.”"
94,"This was something that caused serious concern – to the employers who quickly understood the detrimental effects of drink on their workforce, and to the wives who saw hard earned money being wasted on alcohol when it could and should have been spent on food for the family. As a result the first half of the 19th century saw a rapid increase and growth of temperance societies.  For many single, unattached men in these industrial areas there was no other place to meet and little else to do but drink. It was inevitable that the country should see a sudden rise in drunkenness.  However, in the early part of the 19th century the consumption of beer and spirits in Wales reached new and significantly high – not to say dangerous - levels. This was particularly the case in the newly created industrial regions of the country where iron workers and coal miners, parched after a day of hard physical toil, eagerly sought refuge in the pubs and beer houses of the town.  Gathering together in the evenings after the day's work on the farm or great estate was over, standing around a roaring log fire and drinking beer was, for many years, an important part of the social intercourse of the people.  The drinking of alcohol has long been an important and interesting feature of Welsh life. The village pub, the drovers' inns, the coaching houses on the main transport routes – they all played a part in forming Welsh society.  Temperance was not a new phenomenon. Long before the 19th century there had been pamphlets and broadsheets, often from the religious elements of society, complaining about drunkenness. However, in the main, these writings rarely advocated total abstinence. And even when the temperance societies began to grow in size and strength, it was invariably spirits that they complained about.  Beer was often felt to be a good and necessary beverage for hard-working men and, besides, the quality and quantity of water was severely limited in places like Merthyr and Swansea. At least by drinking beer men were not filling their insides with parasite-infected liquid.  The first temperance hotel was opened, not in Wales but in England, by Joseph Livesey in 1833 and the British Association for the Promotion of Temperance was established in 1835. The movement spread quickly and by the end of that year there were no fewer than 25 temperance societies in Wales, all offering meeting places, an abundance of soft drinks and lectures or debates on the evils of drink.  Interestingly, in those early years of the movement, it was still moderation and not abstinence that was advocated. Groups such as the Ebbw Vale Temperance Society, existing and working in the midst of the burgeoning iron industry, even allowed its members to drink two pints of beer a day – a practice that eventually ended when it transpired that some men were saving up their allowance in order to drink 12 or 14 pints each Saturday.  Faced by such trickery, many temperance societies soon began to campaign for total abstinence; the United Kingdom Alliance, led by John Gough, was particularly virulent on the subject. The first teetotal society in Wales was created as early as 1835 but this was a rarity. However, it was a stance that grew more prominent as the years went on.  According to legend, the name teetotal originated with Richard Turner from Preston, a great supporter of Joseph Livesey. He had an unfortunate stammer and when asked what he stood for, would reply “T-t-t-total abstinence”.  Throughout the middle years of the 19th century the temperance movement grew in strength. Even the old legends of Wales were subsumed into use by the abolitionists with the story of the lost lands of Cantre'r Gwaelod quietly changed to place the blame for the inundation of the 16 cities on the drunken lock keeper Seithennin rather than the maiden Mererid.  As the Encyclopaedia of Wales states: “A vigorous temperance sub-culture came into existence with periodicals, meetings, songs, orders, ceremonies, hotels and pledges and by 1850 teetotalism had been absorbed into the moralistic system of the Noncomformists"".  The demand, right across Wales, to prohibit alcohol became, effectively, a political tool and when someone like Lady Llanover closed down all the public houses on her lands it was clear that this was a political message with bite. Politicians were quick to jump onto the bandwagon, many of them campaigning on the issue for years.  The Sunday closing of public houses in Wales, something that sustained pressure from the members of the temperance movement achieved in 1881, was perhaps its greatest moment. There was little further success, however, until the Defence of the Realm Act in 1914, at the outbreak of World War One, when pub opening hours were limited and the beer on sale was watered down – measures that had little to do with the moral issues but considerably more with helping the war effort.  In the years after the war the temperance movement began to decline in popularity and influence as it quickly became clear that drinking of alcohol was only one of many possible causes of poverty. The Depression years were hard in Wales and nobody was going to begrudge an out of work miner the odd pint or two – provided he did not let his family starve.  The temperance societies were not unique to Wales but, with the country's enormous industrial heritage, they were a significant part of Welsh life for a large part of the 19th century."
95,"Perennial Cockney bridesmaids West Ham United owe their existence to a Mr Dave Taylor, foreman of a shipbuilding company in Canning Town, East London. When he formed Thames Ironworks Football Club in 1895, it is unlikely that he envisaged a legacy that would stretch far beyond his lifetime. Since then, the club have become famous for stylish underachievement and passionate local support, bolstered from afar by such luminaries as Dave Grohl, John Cleese and the keyboard player from the Cure.  Thames Ironworks proved to be a highly effective outfit, which may surprise those familiar with their victory-suspicious modern counterparts. In their first ever match, they drew 1-1 with Royal Ordnance, the game taking place at Hermit Road, Canning Town. The club quickly attracted attention by using experimental floodlighting fashioned from dockside equipment, although this was not enough to prevent them being evicted from Hermit Road and being obliged to play their 'home' games in the newly formed London League at their opponent's venues. Nonetheless, they finished second, which says something for the quality of the team.  In June 1900, the gallant Ironworks side was dissolved as the club became steadily more professional, and immediately reformed as West Ham United Football Club. However, an echo of the 19th Century team can still be found in the club's nickname - 'The Irons' - and the cry of 'Come on you Irons!' that on match days rings around their home ground, Upton Park. The club moved here in 1904. Although universally referred to as Upton Park, the official name is actually the Boleyn Ground, the stadium being built on the site of Green Street House, a residence once owned by Anne Boleyn. The Boleyn pub is the only clue to this former royal property: on match days, it is full of vocal West Ham supporters of a particularly physical kind, and incursions by visiting fans are ill advised and usually brief . The first game at Upton Park was a 3-1 win over mortal enemies Millwall . Games between the sides have been rare over the years, but are marked with great animosity, which usually translates into widespread crowd disorder.  The club crest of two crossed shipbuilding hammers on a castle motif reflects both the team's origins and this tenuous royal connection. It also accounts for the clubs 'other' nickname, the Hammers. It was at the time of the move to Upton Park that the famous claret and blue strip was instigated, the original shirts being sewn together from off-cuts of material supplied by a nearby upholstery shop. Under the gaze of the club's first manager, Syd King, West Ham fared reasonably well until the outbreak of World War One, when many players were lost on the battlefields of France. King served as the club's manager for 30 years, establishing a tradition of continuity and long service - at time of writing, there have only been nine managers in the club's 107-year history.  In 1927, an advertising campaign appeared for soap. It featured a curly haired child blowing soap bubbles, who was likened to one of the West Ham players. This unlikely imagery provided the Hammers with their club anthem, which is roared by supporters several times during the course of a game. The lyrics are as follows:  It is an oddly sentimental rallying cry, although as many have ruefully reflected, fortune usually has hidden for West Ham.  West Ham have always been something of a middling force in English football, reluctant to abandon laudable - if not always advisable - attacking flair for a more robust and rounded tactical approach. While this invariably makes the team very entertaining to watch, it does not over burden them in the trophy department. Most of their history has been spent fluttering between the top two divisions, usually spending three or four seasons in the top flight, before stepping outside for a bit of a breather. Tactically, the team are often too fragile to sustain the level of consistency required for a sustained league campaign. But every dog has his day, and the Hammers have had a few...  The FA Cup is the oldest football competition in the world, laden with romance and an epic, legendary quality all of its own. For the uninitiated, it is a knock out competition, in which teams of all leagues are drawn randomly against each other. Upsets are common - West Ham have tumbled out of the Cup to lowly opposition on more than one occasion - but it is also the competition in which they have enjoyed the most success, with three wins in four Finals.  Wembley Stadium opened in 1923, and West Ham managed to win through to the first FA Cup Final to be held there. Although the ground was built to hold 120,000 supporters, it is estimated that twice this number squeezed in to watch the match. Billie, a white police horse ridden by a constable Storey, became an instant legend as he gently nudged the vast crowd away from the pitch in order that some semblance of normality could be restored. The game kicked off forty-four minutes late, with human touchlines and frequent incursions onto the pitch. The Hammers, playing as ever with the happy contentment of a team who understand that it is the taking part that is the important thing, lost 2-0 to Bolton Wanderers. The game is known in FA Cup lore as 'The White Horse Final'.  West Ham again appeared at Wembley in 1964, this time in a thrilling match against Preston North End, coming from behind twice to snatch victory 3-2 with a last-gasp winner from Ronnie Boyce. Hammers striker Sissons became the youngest Cup Final goal scorer, and the team held the nucleus of England's World Cup winning side of 1966, with scorer Geoff Hurst and captain Bobby Moore, perhaps the best loved English footballer of all time. West Ham fans regularly assert that it was actually West Ham that beat the Germans in 1966, not England.  1975 saw a 2-0 victory against a Fulham side containing Upton Park legend Bobby Moore, playing at the tail end of his career, and West Ham's last triumph was as underdogs against Arsenal in 1980, winning an unspectacular, overly tactical affair, adversely affected by the extraordinary heat. In this match, West Ham midfielder Paul Allen became the youngest player ever to appear in an FA Cup Final - and he should have scored, being cruelly hacked down by Arsenal's Willie Young when clean through on goal, an action that still ruffles feathers at Upton Park. Hammers favourite-turned-pundit Trevor Brooking headed the only goal to seal an unexpected victory.  European success arrived in 1965, as TSV Munich were beaten 2-0 at Wembley. This has thus far been the only European achievement: West Ham lost to Belgian side Anderlecht 4-2 in the final of the same competition in 1976.  West Ham's modestly-sized trophy cabinet is complete with Second Division titles in 1958 and 1981. At time of writing, the club's highest league placing was a remarkable third place in the pre-Premiership First Division in 1986.  Upton Park tube, towards the eastern end of the District and Hammersmith and City Lines, is by far the easiest option. Out of the station, turn right, and walk past the burger stands, chestnut sellers and vendors shouting 'Wear yer cullas! 'ats, scarves and baydges!' until you see the ground. Don't make the classic amateur error and alight at West Ham tube. Although you can catch a bus to the ground from here, you are more likely to get lost in one of the least glorious parts of London. For the same reason, victuals are best partaken of at Liverpool Street, where Central London ends and East London begins. The hooliganism for which West Ham is notorious may be smaller scale these days, but there are still plenty of random scamps about who will happily ruin your afternoon, so it is best to stay 'in town' for refreshment purposes. The overwhelming majority of West Ham fans that cram onto the tube as it winds through East London are, however, a friendly and chatty bunch, especially toward supporters of lesser-known teams. Despite a somewhat tainted reputation, the denizens of Upton Park are appreciative of good football and good support, whomever is providing it. They know that West Ham's traditional encouragement of local talent and commitment to attractive, flowing play has often seen the club at odds with the pressures of the wider football world - but frankly, that's how they like it."
96,"British actress Tracey Ullman is to receive a lifetime achievement prize from Bafta's Los Angeles branch, according to industry reports.  Trade paper Variety said the comedienne will take home Bafta's first ever Charlie Chaplin award at the British Comedy Festival and Awards on 8 May.  Ullman began her career on British TV, with shows like Three Of A Kind.  She later created The Tracey Ullman Show for the US Fox network, winning several Emmy and Golden Globe awards.  The show famously spawned The Simpsons, which started out as short sketches either side of the commercial break.  The British Comedy Festival and Awards take place as part of Los Angeles' annual BritWeek festival.  The event, which honours British involvement in the city's cultural and business life, is the brainchild of American Idol producer and reality TV judge ""nasty"" Nigel Lythgoe.  Ullman's latest sketch series, State of the Union, begins its second season on HBO on Sunday."
97,"A cargo plane has crash-landed in high winds at Japan's largest airport, killing both crew members on board.  The accident happened as the Federal Express plane arrived at Narita international airport, near Tokyo, from Guangzhou in China.  Japan's public broadcaster NHK showed dramatic footage of the plane bouncing as it landed on the runway, then bursting into flames.  Dozens of flights have been cancelled as one runway at Narita remains closed.  The accident happened at about 0650 local time on Monday (2150 GMT Sunday).  The two crew were taken to hospital but both were confirmed dead.  Officials said the pilot, Kevin Kyle Mosley, was 54 years old and the co-pilot, Anthony Stephen Pino, was 49. Both were American.  Footage of the crash shows the plane landing hard, tipping on to its left wing and bursting into flame as it then rolled over.  The plane landed in strong winds, of up to 72 km (45 miles) per hour, and Japan's meteorological agency had issued a gale warning for the area around Narita.  ""We have information that strong winds caused the plane to divert from the runway,"" a Narita Airport spokeswoman told reporters.  But officials said it was too soon to confirm if the winds caused the crash.  The jet was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, according to Japan's Kyodo News.  Airlines have cancelled more than 30 flights and diverted others to nearby airports, because Narita's longest runway remains closed.  Parts of the wreckage were still burning hours after the crash.  Kyodo News said it was the first fatal aircraft accident at Narita Airport since it opened in 1978."
98,"McLaren driver David Coulthard has apologised to Michael Schumacher for their tempestuous off-track relationship this year.  Coulthard has criticised Schumacher's driving on a number of occasions, particularly the German's behaviour at the starts of races.  But after finishing second to Ferrari's new world champion in the season's final race in Malayasia on Sunday, Coulthard admitted that he had said sorry to his rival.  ""I apologised to Michael for the year,"" Coulthard said. ""We had some differences and I am embarrassed because maybe I was saying things too publicly and not just going to see him.  ""I told him he was a great champion and said I looked forward to racing him again next season.  ""I didn't want to give him an advantage by doing it before the weekend, but I wanted to clear the air. Next time there are any problems, I will go to see him rather than talking to the media first.""  But Coulthard made it clear he was not withdrawing the opinions he had offered on Schumacher's driving, only the means by which he had expressed them.  ""It's not a retraction of some of the comments I had on his driving standards, all it is is an acceptance that if you have a problem you should talk to somebody face to face,"" he said.  Schumacher said: ""I am happy he came to talk to me about what has happened in the past and the way he sees things.  ""It shows how good a bloke he is and I look forward to having as good a relationship with him [in the future] as we have had in the past.""  Coulthard's remarks come a week after Schumacher had attacked Coulthard and Jacques Villeneuve, his other most vociferous critic, for going public with their complaints rather than approaching him first.  ""Somehow, it's always the same drivers that one has problems with, like (David) Coulthard and (Jacques) Villeneuve, for example,"" Schumacher told a German newspaper.  ""It's no secret. They all talk and talk and talk all day but never say anything to my face. It's surprising but there's nothing I can do to change it.""  Schumacher and Coulthard have had a number of run-ins over the past two years.  They collided while battling for the lead of the 1998 Argentinian Grand Prix. Then Schumacher accused Coulthard of deliberately taking him out of that year's Belgian race - the Ferrari ran into the back of the McLaren in zero visibility in the rain.  Last year, Schumacher was not impressed by an aggressive manoeuvre by Coulthard to pass him in Malaysia.  And in 2000, a number of rivals have criticised Schumacher's attempts to keep his rivals behind after his usual poor starts.  Coulthard was particularly angered at the French GP in June, when he gave Schumacher the finger from his car while the two were disputing the lead."
99,"He was the British extreme right's most feared streetfighter. But almost right up to his death 20 years ago, Nicky Crane led a precarious dual existence - until it fell dramatically apart.  The skinhead gang marched in military formation down the High Street clutching iron bars, knives, staves, pickaxe handles and clubs.  There were at least 100 of them. They had spent two days planning their attack. The date was 28 March 1980.  Soon they reached their target - a queue of mostly black filmgoers outside the Odeon cinema in Woolwich, south-east London.  Most of them belonged to an extreme far-right group called the British Movement (BM).  This particular ""unit"" had already acquired a reputation for brutal racist violence thanks to its charismatic young local organiser. Many victims had learned to fear the sight of his 6ft 2in frame, which was adorned with Nazi tattoos. His name was Nicky Crane.  But as he led the ambush, Crane was concealing a secret from his enemies and his fascist comrades alike. Crane knew he was gay, but hadn't acted on it. Not yet.  Twelve years later, the same Nicky Crane sat in his Soho bedsit. His room looked out across London's gay village - the bars and nightclubs where he worked as a doorman, where he drank and danced.  Crane flicked through a scrapbook filled with photos and news clippings from his far-right past.  For years he had managed to keep the two worlds entirely separate. But now he wasn't going to pretend any more.  Nicola Vincenzo Crane was born on 21 May 1958 in a semi-detached house on a leafy street in Bexley, south-east London. One of 10 siblings, he grew up in nearby Crayford, Kent.  As his name suggests, he had an unlikely background for a British nationalist and Aryan warrior. He was of Italian heritage through his mother Dorothy, whose maiden name was D'Ambrosio. His father worked as a structural draughtsman.  But from an early age Crane found a surrogate family in the south-east London skinhead scene.  Its members had developed a reputation for violence, starting fights and disrupting gigs by bands such as Sham 69 and Bad Manners. In the late 1970s, gangs like Crane's were widely feared.  ""When you've come from a tough background, when you get that identity, it's a powerful thing to have,"" says Gavin Watson, a former skinhead who later got to know Crane.  The south-east London skins also had close connections to the far right. Whereas the original skinheads in the late 1960s had borrowed the fashion of Caribbean immigrants and shared their love of ska and reggae music, a highly visible minority of skins during the movement's revival in the late 1970s were attaching themselves to groups like the resurgent National Front (NF).  In particular the openly neo-Nazi BM, under the leadership of Michael McLaughlin, was actively targeting young, disaffected working-class men from football terraces as well as the punk and skinhead scenes for recruitment.  Crane was an enthusiastic convert to the ideology of National Socialism.  ""Adolf Hitler was my God,"" he said in a 1992 television interview. ""He was sort of like my Fuhrer, my leader. And everything I done was, like, for Adolf Hitler.""  Within six months of joining the BM, Crane had been made the Kent organiser, responsible for signing up new members and organising attacks on political opponents and minority groups.  He was also inducted into the Leader Guard, which served both as McLaughlin's personal corps of bodyguards and as the party's top fighters. Members wore black uniforms adorned with neo-Nazi symbols and were drilled at paramilitary-style armed training weekends in the countryside.  They were also required to have a Leader Guard tattoo. Each featured the letters L and G on either side of a Celtic cross, the British Movement's answer to the swastika. Crane dutifully had his inked on to his flesh alongside various racist slogans.  By now working as a binman and living in Plumstead, Crane quickly acquired a reputation, even among the ranks of the far right, for exceptionally brutal violence.  In May 1978, following a BM meeting, he took part in an assault on a black family at a bus stop in Bishopsgate, east London, using broken bottles and shouting racist slogans. An Old Bailey judge described Crane as ""worse than an animal"".  The following year he led a mob of 200 skinheads in an attack on Asians in nearby Brick Lane. Crane later told a newspaper how ""we rampaged down the Lane turning over stalls, kicking and punching Pakistanis"".  The Woolwich Odeon attack of 1980 was described by a prosecutor at the Old Bailey as a ""serious, organised and premeditated riot"". After their intended victims fled inside, the skinheads drilled by Crane began smashing the cinema's doors and windows, the court was told. A Pakistani man was knocked unconscious in the melee and the windows of a nearby pub were shattered with a pickaxe handle.  In 1981 Crane was jailed for his part in an ambush on black youths at Woolwich Arsenal station. As the judge handed down a four-year sentence, an acolyte standing alongside Crane stiffened his arm into a Nazi salute and shouted ""sieg heil"" from the dock.  Crane's three jail terms failed to temper his violence. During one stretch, he launched an attack on several prison officers with a metal tray. A six-month sentence following a fracas on a London Tube train was served entirely at the top-security Isle of Wight prison - a sign of just how dangerous he was regarded by the authorities.  All this may have horrified most people, but it made Crane a hugely respected and admired figure across the far right.  He was neither an orator nor a conversationalist. His vocabulary was sparse at best. But he managed to exude a powerful charisma.  ""I knew him, I liked him. He was friendly,"" says Joseph Pearce, who was leader of the Young National Front during the early 1980s before turning his back on extremist politics.  ""He was not the most articulate of people. It would be yes or no. It was difficult to have anything but the most superficial conversation with him.""  In the aftermath of a violent march through racially mixed Lewisham in 1977, much of the UK's extreme right had concluded the path to power lay in controlling the streets and destabilising the multicultural society rather than through the ballot box.  At the same time, groups like the Anti-Nazi League (ANL) and, later, Anti-Fascist Action (AFA) were becoming more and more confrontational.  ""The opposition were very, very combative,"" Pearce says. ""Their strategy was to smash the nationalist movement. It was a necessity to have a street presence that had muscle. Someone like Nicky Crane was a powerful physical but also symbolic presence.""  This was a description with which even Crane's enemies concurred.  ""By appearance and reputation he was the epitome of right-wing idealism - fascist icon and poster boy,"" writes Sean Birchall in his book Beating The Fascists, a history of AFA.  Unbeknown to his comrades, however, a very different side to Nicky Crane was emerging.  It was a Thursday night at Heaven, a gay nightclub below London's Charing Cross station. Underneath the venue's arched roof stood a young man, up from Brighton for the evening. A garrulous character, he was universally known by his full title of John G Byrne.  Since 1969, when he discovered reggae music as a 13-year-old, Byrne had been a skinhead. As he looked across the dancefloor, he caught sight of a man he'd never seen before.  The stranger was tall, shaven-headed and tattooed. Byrne introduced himself.  It was Nicky Crane, fresh out of prison.  ""He stood out quite a lot,"" says Byrne. ""A lot of people used to be quite keen on him because he was a very butch-looking geezer.""  Years later, Crane said he hadn't had sex with a man until after he turned 26 in 1984. But now he was becoming a regular at places like Heaven.  ""I just used to chat to him,"" Byrne adds. ""Nicky was quite a friendly person. He was quite quiet, really. He was the opposite of what he looked like.""  He appears to have thrown himself enthusiastically into the gay scene around this time. His imposing frame meant he easily found work as a doorman at gay venues through a security firm.  But if the neo-Nazi world would have abhorred his sexuality, the vast majority of London's gay scene would have been equally horrified to learn that he was a neo-Nazi.  Among the leadership of the largely liberal-left gay rights movement that was growing in London during the 1980s, fascist symbolism was an obvious and outrageous taboo - a reminder of the persecution that lesbians and gay men had suffered.  According to feminist scholar Sheila Jeffreys' book The Lesbian Heresy, a commotion unfolded in 1984 when a group of gay skinheads turned up at a gay bar in London's King's Cross and began sieg heiling. She also records that a well-known far-right youth organiser was thrown out of the same pub after taking off his jacket to reveal swastika tattoos.  A huge row erupted the following year at the London Lesbian and Gay Centre in King's Cross when a gay skinhead night was held at the venue.  It's not clear whether Crane was present at any of these incidents. But it appears that, at least initially, he was able to deflect questions about his politics by presenting himself on the gay scene as a skinhead first and foremost.  His friend Byrne, who describes himself as ""sort of more a Labour person"", had no time for the far-right element that had infiltrated the skinhead movement.  But Byrne was convinced at the time that Crane ""wasn't really a Nazi. It was all show"". The softly spoken Nicky he knew was too nice to be an extremist, Byrne believed.  This wasn't as fanciful as it might sound.  By the mid-1980s, a gay skinhead scene was beginning to flourish in London, says Murray Healy, author of Gay Skins: Class, Masculinity and Queer Appropriation.  Gay men had many different reasons for adopting the look, he says. Some had been skinheads before they came out. Others found that, in an era when all gay men were widely assumed to be camp and effeminate, ""you were less likely to get picked on if you looked like a queer-basher"". There were also ""fetish skins"", attracted to the ""hyper-masculinity"" of the subculture.  Against this backdrop, even the swastikas and racist slogans inked on Crane's body could be explained away, at least initially. During the 1980s, says Healy, ""gay Nazis were assumed to be left-wing even if they had Nazi tattoos"".  ""People refused to read these tattoos politically. People thought it was part of the authenticity ritual. People thought he was just playing a part.""  And indeed it wasn't just gay skins who flirted with the iconography of fascism. While ""redskins"" and ""Sharps"" - an acronym for Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice - confronted those with links to the far right, many heterosexual skinheads who were apolitical also adopted fascist garb, says Byrne.  ""A lot of skinheads that weren't right-wing used to wear Skrewdriver T-shirts,"" Byrne adds. ""It was about the fashion of being a skinhead.""  But Crane wasn't just playing with the imagery of Nazism. He was living it. His decision to start frequenting venues such as Heaven wasn't the only thing that had changed since before his sentence.  During the years 1981 to 1984, which he mostly spent incarcerated, his fame had grown far beyond the narrow confines of the far right.  In 1981, the journalist Garry Bushell helped put together a compilation album of tracks by bands from the burgeoning Oi! scene.  Oi!, a cheerfully crude sub-genre of punk, was popular with skinheads. Its politics were fairly broad - while there were right-wingers within its ranks, some of its most prominent acts, including the Angelic Upstarts, were avowed socialists. Others, such as the 4-Skins, condemned political extremism of all kinds.  That was to count for little after Bushell, desperate for a cover image after a photoshoot fell through, seized on a Christmas card which he says he believed showed a scene from the film The Wanderers. In fact, it was a picture of Crane.  It was only when the image was blown up to 12in cover size, Bushell says, that he noticed Crane's Nazi tattoos. Faced with the choice of airbrushing out his markings or pulling the release, the writer chose the former option.  ""It was a monumentally, cataclysmically stupid decision,"" he says. The title of the compilation was Strength Thru Oi! - which Bushell says was intended as a pun on Strength Through Joy, the title of a recent EP by punk act The Skids, but which in turn was borrowed from a Nazi slogan.  The Daily Mail seized upon the title and the connection with Crane, condemning the ""highly controversial"" record as ""evil"".  According to Bushell, who had only recently left the Socialist Workers Party and still regarded himself at the time as a left-winger, the story was a ""tissue of lies"". But as a result of the coverage, the hitherto obscure Oi! scene became associated by many with the far right - to the chagrin of acts featured on the album, such as the socialist poet Gary Johnson.  Crane's musical background had hitherto extended to starting fights at ska and punk gigs, plus a short-lived stint singing in a punk band called The Afflicted.  The notoriety, however, transformed him into a skinhead icon. The Strength Thru Oi! cover image - featuring a topless, muscle-bound Crane snarling and raising his boot - was widely reproduced in the wake of the row.  T-shirts featuring the image were sold at The Last Resort, a clothes shop favoured by skinheads in London's Whitechapel. They were a huge hit. Although the album was withdrawn from sale, reproductions of its cover adorned thousands of bedroom walls.  ""He was literally a poster boy,"" says Watson, who at the time was a teenage skin in Buckinghamshire. ""Even a 15-year-old was like, 'That's what a skinhead should look like.'  ""He just fell into our living rooms. These little kids in High Wycombe - we didn't know anything about the Nazi stuff.""  On the surface, the idea of a gay man embracing neo-Nazism might appear baffling and self-defeating. Just as Adolf Hitler's regime had thrown gays and lesbians into death camps, the neo-Nazi movement remained staunchly homophobic.  Crane was becoming all too aware of the contradiction of being a gay neo-Nazi. ""A lot of people that I did used to hang around with, they did sort of like hate us,"" he said in 1992 - ""us"" meaning gay men.  ""They'd go out queer-bashing. It's something I never did myself. And I'd never let it happen in front of me, either.""  He had, however, chosen fascism long before he had embraced his sexuality, and much of his social life and prestige was bound up with his status as a prominent neo-Nazi activist.  To maintain his cover, Crane would often appear in public with a skinhead girl on his arm. ""He often had a so-called girlfriend but they were never around for long,"" says Pearce. ""Nicky had no chemistry with girls.""  Certainly, after coming out, Crane always described himself as gay rather than bisexual.  Nonetheless, his relationships with women, coupled with rumours that he had fathered a son, allayed any initial suspicions his comrades might have had. So too did his propensity for racist violence.  On Sunday 10 June 1984, Greater London Council leader Ken Livingstone held a free open-air concert to protest against unemployment and government spending cuts.  Thousands of Londoners turned out to watch acts like The Smiths and Billy Bragg. Most would have been attracted principally by the music and the summer weather.  To Nicky Crane, however, anyone attending a left-wing-hosted event like this was a legitimate target.  As The Redskins, a socialist skinhead band, played, Crane led an attack on the crowd. Around 100 fascists began setting about the audience closest to the main stage.  ""They were organised, they were used to violence, the audience wasn't,"" says Gary, an anti-fascist activist who was present that day and asked to be identified only by his first name.  The neo-Nazis were beaten back by a group of striking Yorkshire miners, invited to steward the event by Livingstone as a solidarity gesture, and members of the militant far-left group Red Action.  Crane was not cowed, however, and after regrouping his forces, he charged a second stage at the other end of the park where the Hank Wangford Band were playing.  This time, however, the anti-fascists were better prepared. Militants grabbed empty cider bottles to use as improvised weapons.  As the anti-fascists fought back, Crane broke away from the main battle. ""He was busy attacking the rest of the crowd, on his own, stripped to the waist,"" says Gary.  As Crane tried to make it over a barrier on to the stage, he was knocked over by a Red Action member. He escaped the furious crowd by using a female left-wing activist as a human shield, according to witnesses.  As the violence subsided, anti-fascists confronted another skinhead in the crowd. His Harrington jacket was unzipped to reveal a slogan on his T-shirt. It read ""Nicky Crane"", in tribute to the young man's hero.  Given the carnage Crane had just instigated, the left-wingers had little sympathy for his admirer. The skinhead was set upon and beaten.  Crane was never prosecuted for his part in the riot.  In the febrile atmosphere of the mid-1980s, however, violence was everywhere.  As clashes between police and striking miners becoming increasingly bitter, football hooligans across the country were fighting it out with unprecedented ferocity. The formation of AFA in 1985 resulted in increasingly bloody stand-offs between anti-fascists and the far right.  Several years later, Crane told the Sun newspaper about an attack on a Jewish Remembrance Day ceremony for which he also appears to have escaped arrest.  ""We hurled insults at them and started punching and kicking as they went by,"" he admitted to the paper in 1992.  On another occasion, Crane and his gang spotted a left-wing activist on a Tube train. ""Me and a few mates beat him really badly,"" he said. ""Even though he wasn't moving we all kept jumping on his head.  ""I think he survived. It must have been a miracle.""  After the BM collapsed in 1983, Crane had become something of a free agent. He was a visible presence on demonstrations held by other far-right groups. These included the NF - now split into two warring factions - and the British National Party, formed in 1982 by John Tyndall, which had begun to attract a significant football hooligan following.  Among the rank and file of each group, Crane remained a hero.  ""You could very easily drop him into the Weimar Republic in 1923 and, some language difficulties apart, he'd fit right in,"" says Gary.  His closest affiliation, however, was with the neo-Nazi rock band Skrewdriver. Originally the group had been apolitical. In 1982, however, singer Ian Stuart Donaldson came out as a supporter of the National Front.  With song titles like Europe Awake and Flying the Flag, the group gained a huge following among far-right skinheads.  Opposition from anti-fascists meant gigs had to be forcefully stewarded. Donaldson appointed Crane as Skrewdriver's head of security, and he became a trusted lieutenant.  Reportedly, Crane wrote the lyrics for a Skrewdriver track called Justice and provided the cover art for the albums Hail The New Dawn and After The Fire.  Archive footage of their concerts shows Donaldson barking neo-Nazi lyrics as he loomed above Crane who stood, arms folded, at the front of the stage. The T-shirt on his chest said ""Skrewdriver security"" in Gothic script.  Crane wasn't playing an instrument, but it was as though he was part of the performance.  His status as a neo-Nazi icon had never been more secure. But for the first time, the twin strands of his double life were about to intersect.  The anti-fascist magazine Searchlight was, despite its political leanings, required reading for activists on the extreme right. Each month the publication would run gossip about the neo-Nazi scene, and fascists would furtively buy it to see whether they had earned a mention.  In April 1985 it ran a feature on Crane. It mentioned the GLC concert, the south London attacks and the jail sentences he had served. The magazine revealed it had received a Christmas card from him during his time on the Isle of Wight in which he proclaimed his continued allegiance to ""the British Movement tradition"" - that is, violence.  The Searchlight report ended its description of Crane with the line: ""On Thursday nights he can be found at the Heaven disco in Charing Cross.""  Even a neo-Nazi audience might have been aware that Heaven was at this point London's premier gay club. Nicky Crane had been outed. And homosexuality was anathema to neo-Nazis.  But the response of Crane's comrades to the revelation was to ignore it.  A number of factors allowed Crane to brush off the report, Pearce says. Firstly, homosexuality was indelibly associated with effeminacy by the far right, and Crane was the very opposite of effeminate.  Secondly, no-one wanted to be seen to believe Searchlight above the word of a committed soldier for the Aryan cause.  Thirdly, on the most basic level, everyone was afraid of being beaten up by Crane if they challenged him.  ""I remember it was just sort of furtive whispering,"" adds Pearce. ""I'm not aware that anyone confronted Nicky. People were happy for things to remain under the carpet.""  Sightings at gay clubs were dismissed by Crane.  Donaldson claimed Crane told him that he was obliged to take jobs at places like Heaven because the security firm he was employed by sent him there.  ""I accepted him at face value, as he was a nationalist,"" Donaldson told a fanzine years later.  For his part, Heaven's then-owner, Jeremy Norman, says he does not recall Crane working on the door: ""I would imagine that the door staff would have been supplied by a security contractor and that he would have been their employee but it is all a long time ago.""  Rumours circulated that a prominent football hooligan and far-right activist had hurled a homophobic slur at Crane, who in response had inflicted a severe beating which the victim was lucky to survive.  Word of this spread among the skinhead fraternity, too.  ""My mate had a shop in Soho,"" recalls Watson. ""People would come in to say, 'Have you heard Nicky's gay?' He would say, he works around the corner, why don't you go and ask him? Of course they never did.""  Just as some in the gay community refused to believe that a gay man could be a neo-Nazi, others on the extreme right were unable to acknowledge that a neo-Nazi could be a gay man.  In 1987 Crane and Donaldson set up a group called Blood & Honour. It was a cross between a White Power music club and a political party.  It staged concerts for Skrewdriver and other neo-Nazi bands with names like No Remorse and Brutal Attack. T-shirts, flags and records were sold by mail order through its magazine. The operation had an annual turnover of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Donaldson was its head, Crane his right-hand man and head of security.  Around the same time, the latter's organisational skills were being put to use elsewhere.  Searchlight reported in October 1987 that ""Crane, the right's finest example of a clinical psychopath, is also engaged in building a 'gay skins' movement, which meets on Friday nights"" at a pub in east London.  Crane's sexuality might by now have been obvious to any interested onlooker, but the neo-Nazi scene remained in denial.  While his right-wing colleagues studiously ignored the report, AFA took an interest. Its activists put the pub under surveillance.  The anti-fascists didn't care about Crane's sexuality, but were concerned that the gatherings might have a political objective. ""Here were gay skinheads wearing Nazi regalia,"" says Gary. ""We could never get to the bottom of it - whether it was purely a sexual fetish.""  The gay community had, by this stage, begun to take notice of Crane, too. He was confronted by anti-fascists attending a Pride rally in Kennington, south London, in 1986.  The campaigner Peter Tatchell recalls a row erupting after it emerged Crane had been allowed to steward a gay rights march. The organisers had not been aware who Crane was or what his political affiliations were.  But now they were, and Crane must have realised he would no longer be welcome in much of gay London. The gay skinhead night may simply have been an attempt to carve out a space for himself where he would not be challenged either for his sexuality or his politics.  While his status in the far right was secure, he was being pushed to the fringes of the gay community. The double life he had been maintaining was beginning to erode.  The Bloody Sunday commemoration rally was held every January to mark the deaths of 14 unarmed protesters at the hands of the Parachute Regiment in Derry in 1972.  For years the rally had been a target for the far right, whose sympathies in the Northern Ireland conflict mostly lay with the loyalists. So when Nicky Crane was spotted within the vicinity of the march in Kilburn, a traditionally Irish enclave of north-west London, in January 1990, it was assumed he had trouble in mind.  Crane was confronted by anti-fascist activists who were stewarding the event and, after a brief exchange of blows, he managed to get away.  But when he was spotted in a black cab heading back into the area, marchers took it as read that he was about to spearhead an ambush on the march.  After the taxi became stuck in traffic at the top of Kilburn High Road it was quickly surrounded.  Crane was pulled from the vehicle and found himself on the receiving end of the kind of violence he had long inflicted on others. After putting up fierce resistance, he was beaten unconscious.  Three anti-fascists were jailed for a total of 11 years for their part in the incident. Unusually for a political street fighter who deplored the system, Crane testified at their trial.  It was a hint that Crane was preparing to cut his ties with the extreme right.  ""I don't think he'd have done it in his fascist days, put it that way,"" says Gary. ""You didn't go to the police. Hard men don't do that, they sort it out among themselves.""  It was not the first indication that Crane was losing his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. In May 1989 he had fled when anti-fascists turned up to a meeting point in London's Hyde Park for a Blood & Honour gig.  After the Bloody Sunday march, there is no record of Crane taking part in any further political activity. He had begun drifting away from the extreme right.  Friends say he had begun spending an increasing amount of time in Thailand, where his past was not known and he could, for the first time since Strength Thru Oi! was released, be anonymous.  Back in London, he appeared in a series of skinhead-themed amateur gay porn videos. The films did not achieve wide circulation but, to star in them in the first place, he must have been indifferent to whether or not he was exposed.  Eventually he made a decision. It was time to end the double life once and for all.  The Channel 4 programme was called Out. It featured a series of documentaries about lesbian and gay life in the UK. The episode broadcast on 27 July 1992 was about the gay skinhead subculture. Its star attraction was Nicky Crane.  First the programme showed recorded interviews with an unwitting Donaldson, who sounded baffled that such a thing as gay skinheads existed, and NF leader Patrick Harrington.  And then the camera cut to Crane, in camouflage gear and Dr Martens boots, in his Soho bedsit.  He told the interviewer how he'd known he was gay back in his early BM days. He described how his worship of Hitler had given way to unease about the far right's homophobia.  He had started to feel like a hypocrite because the Nazi movement was so anti-gay, he said. ""So I just, like, couldn't stay in it."" Crane said he was ""ashamed"" of his political past and insisted he had changed.  ""The views I've got now is, I believe in individualism and I don't care if anyone's black, Jewish or anything,"" he added. ""I either like or dislike a person as an individual, not what their colour is or anything.""  The revelation attracted considerable press attention. The Sun ran a story with the headline ""NAZI NICK IS A PANZI"". Below it described the ""Weird secret he kept from gay-bashers"".  Crane reiterated that he had abandoned Nazi ideology. ""It is all in the past,"" he told the paper. ""I've made a dramatic change in my life.""  The reaction from his erstwhile comrades was one of horror and fury. Donaldson issued a blood-curdling death threat on stage at a Skrewdriver gig.  ""He's dug his own grave as far as I'm concerned,"" Donaldson told the Last Chance fanzine. ""I was fooled the same as everybody else. Perhaps more than everybody else. I felt I was betrayed by him and I want nothing to do with him whatsoever.""  But according to Pearce - who by this stage had made his own break with the NF - it was Crane's disavowal of National Socialism, rather than the admission of his sexuality, that proved particularly painful for Donaldson.  ""I think that Ian would have been very shocked,"" says Pearce. ""He was deeply hurt. But it had more to do with the fact that he switched sides politically.  ""Nicky didn't just come out as a homosexual, he became militantly opposed to what he previously believed in.""  British Nazism had lost its street-fighting poster boy. For the first time in his adult life, however, Crane was able to be himself.  Watson recalls catching a glimpse of Crane - by then working as a bicycle courier - shortly after he came out. ""I saw him riding around Soho in Day-Glo Lycra shorts,"" remembers Watson. ""I thought, good for you.""  On 8 December 1993, Byrne took the train to London. He had arranged to meet his friend Nicky Crane at Berwick Street market, just a few yards from his Rupert Street bedsit.  Byrne was looking forward to having ""a good old chat"" about skinheads they both knew. But Crane didn't turn up.  When Byrne got home, he found out why. Crane had died the day before. He was 35. The cause of death was given on his death certificate as bronchopneumonia, a fatal inflammation of the air passages to the lungs.  He was a victim of the disease that had killed so many other young gay men of his generation.  ""He didn't tell me about his problems with Aids,"" says Byrne. ""He didn't talk much about it really. I thought it was a shame.""  Word had got around that Crane was ill, however. Gary recalls his shock at seeing his one-time foe looking deeply emaciated, waiting on a platform at Baker Street Tube station. Crane's stature was such, however, that even at this point fellow passengers were careful to keep their distance.  Those who suffered as a result of his rampages may have breathed a sigh of relief that he was no longer able to terrorise them.  But his death marked more than just the end of Nicky Crane.  It also coincided with the passing of an era in which the extreme right hoped to win power by controlling the street with boots and fists.  In 1993, Crane was dead, Donaldson died in a car crash and the British National Party (BNP) won its first council seat in Millwall, east London. The various factions of the NF had by now all but withered.  The following year, BNP strategist Tony Lecomber announced there would be ""no more meetings, marches, punch-ups"" - instead, the intention now was to win seats in town halls. The party would try to rebrand itself as respectable and peaceful - a strategy continued, with varying success, under the leadership of Nick Griffin. Streetfighters like Nicky Crane were supposedly consigned to the past.  The broader skinhead movement was changing, too.  Watson, like many other former skins, had by the time of Crane's death, abandoned boots and braces for the rave scene. His skinhead days already felt like a different age.  ""The skinhead stuff was washed away by rave and it's, 'Oh yes, Nicky's out of the closet,'"" Watson says. ""It's the story of that side of skinheads, isn't it?""  By contrast, the presence of skinheads in gay clubs and bars was no longer controversial. Shorn of its political associations, the look was by now, if anything, more popular in London's Old Compton Street or Manchester's Canal Street than on football terraces or far-right rallies.  Two decades after Crane's death, says Healy, the skinhead is ""recognised as a gay man unambiguously in London and Manchester"". He adds: ""If the Village People reformed today there would be a skinhead in the group.""  He may be an extreme case, but Crane reflects an era in which people's expectations of what a gay man looked and behaved like began to shift.  ""Everybody always knew gay people, but they just didn't know it,"" says Max Schaefer, whose 2010 novel Children of the Sun features a character fascinated by Crane. ""The neo-Nazis were no different from everyone else.""  It's unlikely Crane reflected on his place at this intersection between all these late 20th Century subcultures. He was a man of action, not ideology - a doer who left the thinking to others, and this may be what led a confused, angry young man to fascism in the first place.  As he lingered in St Mary's hospital in Paddington, west London, waiting to die, a young man named Craig was at his side. Craig was ""one of Nicky's boyfriends"", says Byrne.  According to Crane's death certificate, Craig was with him at the end.  Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook"
100,"The votes are still being counted in UK-wide elections, the single biggest test of political opinion until the 2020 general election.  The SNP is claiming a ""historic victory"" but it did not win enough seats to form a majority government. The Conservatives, in a move that would been unthinkable in the past, pushed Labour into third place in Scotland, with leader Ruth Davidson winning her seat from the SNP. The Greens overtook the Lib Dems.  UKIP had a good night and have won their first assembly seats, getting 12.5% of votes. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood picked up a key seat from Labour, who remain the largest party but have just missed out on a majority.  Labour had a mixed night in council elections, holding on to some key authorities that it had been expected to lose but facing criticism that it had not done well enough to suggest victory in the 2020 general election. With all 124 council results in, Labour was down 18 councillors on the last time these seats were contested, in 2012. The Conservatives were down 48 councillors on 2012 while the Lib Dems - who won control of one council, Watford - and UKIP had gained 45 and 25 councillors respectively. The Greens are down three.  Police and crime commissioners in England and Wales: Party candidates swept aside most of the independents that took control of police areas in the first PCC elections four years ago. The number of independents went down from 12 to three, with the Conservatives going from 16 to 20 PCCs. Labour increased its number of PCCs from 12 to 15. Plaid Cymru was the only other party to get a look-in, with two PCCs, although UKIP ran the Conservatives a close second in a couple of areas. Turnout was up by more than 20% up on 2012, when it was among the lowest for any elections ever held. It was lowest in areas where local elections were not being held.  Northern Ireland: Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has 38 seats, Sinn Féin 28, Ulster Unionists 16, SDLP 12 and the Alliance Party eight. First minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster topped the poll in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The Greens and People Before Profit Alliance have two seats each. The TUV leader Jim Allister remains its sole representative. In South Down, John McCallister became the first high-profile MLA to lose his seat.  London: Sadiq Khan has been elected the new Mayor of London, beating Conservative Zac Goldsmith by 1,310,143 votes to 994,614. Labour remains largest party on the London Assembly.  ""We have tonight made history,"" Nicola Sturgeon, on the SNP winning a third consecutive Scottish Parliament election  ""All across England last night we were getting predictions that we were going to lose councils. We didn't,"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  ""Local election day for sitting prime ministers is supposed to be a day of dread... that wasn't what it was like last night,"" Prime Minister David Cameron  ""I would have liked to see Labour do a lot better than this, because for me, my focus is on winning that general election and kicking the Tories out in 2020,"" former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie  ""The SNP must now let Scotland move on. There has been a material change,"" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson  ""A new dawn has already broken over the Valleys, people have voted for change,"" Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood  ""Scotland has not been a success for us, but Wales is a big success,"" UKIP leader Nigel Farage  ""My burning ambition for our city, that will guide my mayoralty, is to ensure that all Londoners get the opportunities that my city gave to me,"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan  Jeremy Corbyn's party has swerved universal disaster - losses so far in England are fewer than some had feared. But with meltdown in Scotland, and losses where there should traditionally be gains, Labour would be foolish to take much comfort from the results.  There is little to suggest that voters believe the Labour Party on its current performance is on its way to a general election victory. Mr Corbyn's internal enemies are not likely to wield the knife, but there are already calls for more decisive leadership, more appeals to go to the centre ground.  More of Election 2016 in pictures"
101,"Kimi Raikkonen has said the reason he will leave Lotus and race for Ferrari next year is because he has not been paid by his current team.  The Finn, who is on a basic salary of eight million euros (£6.7m), is joining Fernando Alonso at Ferrari next season.  ""I haven't got my salary,"" said the former world champion. ""I like to race - that's the only reason why I'm here.""  Lotus team boss Eric Boullier said: ""The truth is, yes, we owe him money. He is going to be paid.  He added: ""Last year it was the same. We owed him some money and he got paid in full at the end of the year.  ""It is just the way we manage our cash flow. We are not as rich as some of the teams at the front.  ""Maybe it is not as sustainable as it should be. We have favoured our people working in Enstone, which is understandable I think. There is nothing else behind this.""  Raikkonen said that despite being owed money by the team he would continue to race for Lotus this season.  ""It's unfortunate but I want to help the team and I want to win,"" he added.  Before making his decision to join Ferrari, which was announced last week, to form potentially the strongest driver line-up on the grid, Raikkonen had asked Lotus for reassurances that they had the technical and financial strength to continue to compete at the front next year.  ""There were a lot of things and they know what they are. Hard to say how it would have gone if they had done them,"" he said.  The 33-year-old has not been paid at all so far this season.  As well as his basic salary, he also earns a bonus of 50,000 euros a point and has therefore earned 14.7m euros (£12.6m).  He earned a total of 18.35m euros (£15.8m) last year, when the team were also late in paying him.  There have been claims from former F1 drivers that partnering Raikkonen with Alonso, a double world champion who has led Ferrari for four years, is a potentially explosive mixture.  But both men said they did not foresee any problems.  Raikkonen, who is replacing Brazilian Felipe Massa, said: ""I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work. We are old enough to know what we are doing and the team is for sure working for the right things.  ""If there is something, I'm sure we can talk it through. It's not like we're 20. I might be wrong but time will tell. For sure there will be good fights on the race track. Sometimes things go wrong, but I'm pretty sure it will be OK.  Alonso said: ""The motivation will be always similar. I will do my best all the time. Sometimes you deliver the results people expect; sometimes not. I don't think anyone will push me more than I push now.  ""[Having] two world champions - I don't think that makes any difference. It is something you keep writing these days and many people try to say (there will be problems).  ""It is exactly the same as when I arrived here with Felipe. [People said], 'Felipe was in Ferrari many years already, and it will be a very difficult relationship'. And after four years he is one of the best friends I have here.  ""So for next year it will be the same but it is something probably you will not write.  ""Felipe, I consider him like a world champion as well. It is not that one title that will change anything in the relationship or the team in terms of pushing. Felipe was world champion when he crossed the line in 2008, so it is not like he is a rookie driver.""  Although Massa has backed Alonso's title campaign at times in the last few seasons, the Spaniard said there would be no change in the team's approach.  ""These four years with Ferrari - or with any other team, (such as) when I was with Renault - we start in Australia in the same conditions.  ""The cars are the same. We try to score as many points as possible. Sometimes you have better luck, sometimes worse luck and then arrive the final races of the championship.  ""Sometimes one of the drivers has been lucky enough to score enough points to fight for the championship and Ferrari try to help that possibility, some other teams they don't try to help that possibility and they lose the championship. Like I was in one of them [at McLaren in 2007].  ""It is not that there is a first or second driver, it is the luck of the championship and how it goes one way or another."""
102,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Dissident republicans, the Continuity IRA, have said they murdered a policeman in Northern Ireland. He was Constable Stephen Paul Carroll, 48, a married man with children from the Banbridge area of County Down. He died just 48 hours after two soldiers were shot dead by the Real IRA at an army base in Antrim. Monday night's shooting happened at Lismore Manor, in Craigavon, County Armagh, after a woman called police when her window was broken. Constable Carroll was shot through the rear window of his police car when he arrived at the scene at about 2145 GMT on Monday. Police say they are looking for a man in a light coloured top who was seen running from the area after the shooting. At least two houses have been searched in the nearby Drumbeg estate. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Chief Superintendent Alan Todd said the constable had given 23 years of service to the community, working with the police service. ""We have this morning, colleagues without a workmate, a wife without a husband, a son without a father and grandchildren without their grandfather,"" he said. ""It is a desperate loss ... we are working with people to provide safer communities, my question to the people who perpetrated this is 'What have they got to offer?'"" The Continuity IRA is one of a number of dissident republican paramilitary groups opposed to the peace process which have carried out bomb and gun attacks on civilians and the security forces. There is believed to be cross-over and co-operation between the Continuity IRA and the larger Real IRA, which bombed Omagh in 1998 killing 29 people and injuring hundreds more. Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde called it a ""sad day"" for Northern Ireland's force and said the gunmen were ""criminal psychopaths"", but said he would not ask for the Army to help patrol NI's streets. ""I have no intention to ask the Army for routine military support, it's not necessary and it doesn't work,"" he said. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Sir Hugh held a joint press conference with the first and deputy first ministers Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness at Stormont. Mr Robinson said: ""This is a battle of wills between the political class and the evil gunmen - the political class will win."" Mr McGuinness said the dissidents' actions were futile: ""These people are traitors to the island of Ireland, they have betrayed the political desires, hopes and aspirations of all of the people who live on this island."" Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned the murderers and insisted there would be ""no return to the old days"" in Northern Ireland. This is the first murder of a police officer in NI since 1998. Constable Frank O'Reilly was killed by a loyalist blast bomb during disturbances linked to the Drumcree dispute in 1998. The last police officers murdered by republicans, RUC constables Roland John Graham and David Andrew Johnston, were shot dead by the IRA in Lurgan, County Armagh in June 1997. Constable Carroll was the first PSNI officer to have been murdered by paramilitaries since the force was formed in 2001. Dissident republicans tried to kill two PSNI officers in shootings in Derry and Dungannon in November 2007. They have also been linked to a booby trap bomb which exploded under a police officer's car in Spamount, County Tyrone in May 2008. HAVE YOUR SAY These events show that the peace process is still under threat Politicians from all parties condemned Monday's killing, which Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward insisted would not damage the peace process. Asked if the killing was linked to the soldiers' shooting at the weekend, Sir Hugh Orde said: ""I think you are giving (the attackers) credit they ill deserve. ""I think these are disparate groups, badly infiltrated and indeed many awaiting trial north and south of the border. The first and deputy first ministers have again postponed an investment visit to the US following the murder.

103,"Unofficial overnight ratings showed the BBC One total at only 6.2m compared to 8.1m for ITV1's Emmerdale.  It comes only a day after EastEnders' executive producer Louise Berridge quit over falling ratings.  A spokeswoman for the BBC said: ""It's incredibly difficult when the soap opera audience is split.""  She said the dip in viewers was unusual as the soap had maintained a steady average over the summer.  On Tuesday, EastEnders attracted only a 30% share of viewers, whereas the ITV soap took 41.5%.  On the previous Tuesday, 9.6 million watched EastEnders, when it was screened against Champions League football on ITV1.  The figures do not take into account viewers who record programmes to watch later.  Ms Berridge left to ""move on to new challenges"" after ratings fell from an average of 13 million at the start of 2004 to 11 million in June.  In July she defended the soap after a Mirror newspaper survey found that 57% of viewers thought it had lost its appeal.  More than half of those questioned thought EastEnders needed stronger plotlines.  Emmerdale took home three prizes from the British Soap Awards in May, compared to seven for EastEnders.  Kathleen Hutchison, currently executive producer of BBC One hospital series Holby City, is to take over Ms Berridge's role at EastEnders."
104,"Pakistan's president has directed that there should be no official celebrations of Independence Day on Saturday as the country tries to cope with devastating floods.  Asif Ali Zardari will instead spend the day touring affected regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces.  He has been heavily criticised at home for not taking a more direct role.  The region's worst flooding in 80 years has affected 14 million and killed 1,600, according to the UN.  Flood levels are expected to surge even higher along parts of the already dangerously swollen Indus river, with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) saying ""major peaks"" were expected next week in Punjab and Sindh provinces.  Mr Zardari has been bitterly criticised by opposition politicians and the media for pressing ahead with his European tour last week as the country was devastated by the floods.  He spent Thursday visiting affected areas in Sukkur in Sindh province, and has said that although he will still visit Russia next week, he will stay only a few hours instead of the scheduled two days.  His spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, said in a statement on Friday: ""President Asif Ali Zardari has directed that in view of the floods, no Independence Day celebrations will be held in the Presidency this year.  ""He will spend the day with the flood-affected people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.""  The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says there will be no special official gatherings or flag-raising ceremonies. Special parades at military corps headquarters will not take place and official buildings will not be specially lit.  The annual gathering and civic awards ceremony at the president's house will also not take place. Major firework, cultural and music shows will be cancelled.  Our correspondent says people will still be free to celebrate the public holiday as they see fit but such celebrations may be low-key this year as the mood is sombre. He says it is unlikely many objections will be raised to the president's move, with many appreciating that ostentatious festivities would be inappropriate.  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on Saturday and will hold talks with officials and visit flood-affected areas the following day.  The UN on Wednesday launched a $459m (£294m) appeal for emergency aid but says billions will be needed in the long-term.  The president welcomed Mr Ban's visit, Mr Babar said, adding that ""the colossal damage to life, property, livestock and infrastructure was so huge that it could be faced only with the concerted efforts of the people of Pakistan and the support and assistance of the international community"".  NDMA spokesman Ahmed Kamal warned there could be ""further devastation as we are expecting two major peaks in the Indus system"".  He said places downstream of the Kotri barrage - a flood barrier in Sindh - and areas on either side of the Taunsa barrage in Punjab were likely to take the brunt of this surge.  Several villages in Thatta district, downstream of Kotri, have been evacuated. It is a big agricultural zone that has some of the richest farms in the country.  Our correspondent, M Ilyas Khan, says the cost of agricultural losses is still hard to quantify.  Minister for Food and Agriculture Nazar Mohammad Gondal put the figure at ""billions of rupees"", although agricultural associations have been more specific.  The Crops Protection Association put the loss of the cotton crop alone at $1.8bn.  The Agricultural Farms Association said 17 million acres of farm land was under water, with 100,000 cattle and more than one million tonnes of privately stored wheat lost. Some 3,000 fish farms, 2,000 poultry farms and 1,000 tractors had been destroyed, it said.  Aid agencies continue to struggle to cope with the scale of the disaster.  Jacques de Maio, head of operations for South Asia at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said: ""Clearly at this point in time, the overall relief effort cannot keep pace with the overall scale of the emergency.""  Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani vowed that ""every single penny"" of aid would be accounted for.  Medics in a relief camp in southern Punjab told the BBC the main challenges they faced were gastroenteritis, diarrhoea and skin infections.  But they are also increasingly worried about malaria, which is being worsened by all the stagnant water.  BBC World Service's Newshour will broadcast a one-hour programme on the Pakistan floods, hosted by Lyse Doucet from Karachi, at 1200 GMT on Saturday 14 August."
105,"Public buildings are being draped in black and purple as a mark of respect.  King Tupou IV was absolute ruler of the South Pacific island nation for 41 years, making him the world's fourth longest-serving monarch.  His son, Crown Prince Tupouto'a, was sworn in as the new king at a brief ceremony on Monday, but it could be at least a year before a full coronation.  Correspondents say King Tupou IV was much loved by his people, but his death is likely to fuel calls for greater democracy.  King Tupou's death was reported late on Sunday at Auckland's Mercy Hospital, where he had been receiving treatment since April.  The Tongan government made a formal announcement shortly afterwards. ""The sun has set in the kingdom of Tonga,"" it said in a statement.  The king's body will remain in Auckland until Wednesday, before being moved back to Tonga to lie in state.  Mourning has already begun and is expected to last up to a year.  King Tupou took over the monarchy in 1965, after the death of his mother, Queen Salote, and soon began modernising the archipelago's education system and infrastructure.  The king made headlines around the world in the 1970s, when he became the world's heaviest monarch at over 200 kg (440 lb).  But in the 1990s he headed a national keep fit campaign and shed a third of his weight.  For most of his reign, King Tupou had the respect and loyalty of his subjects and other leaders in the South Pacific.  But in recent years, he has faced increasing dissent.  In 2005, thousands of people took to the streets to demand democracy and public ownership of key assets, in unprecedented public demonstrations.  South Pacific analysts say the king's death is likely to fuel demands for greater liberalisation in Tonga.  The king's death is the second blow to the Tongan royal family and the Tongan people in recent months.  The kingdom has only recently mourned the death of one of the king's nephews, who, along with his wife, was killed in a car crash in San Francisco in July."

107,"Barnet have confirmed that Mark Robson has left his role of joint-head coach, leaving Edgar Davids in sole charge of the League Two club.  Robson joined Barnet as head coach in the summer but failed to win any of his first 11 League games in charge.  Former Netherlands international Davids was brought to Underhill in mid-October and was given shared responsibility for the team.  Now, the Bees currently lie three points clear of the relegation zone.  A statement on the Barnet website said: ""It was felt that clarification was required regarding the coaching responsibilities at the club.  ""To this end it was agreed that Mark should leave with immediate effect.

""The club would like to thank Mark for all his efforts and hard work and wish him the very best for the future."""
108,"Dutch MEP Paul van Buitenen has published a confidential internal report on abuse of staff allowances described by a colleague as ""dynamite"". The report highlights money paid for non-existent staff via a system of ""service providers"" or accountants. He posted a short summary of the report on his website and could face a reprimand for breaching secrecy. British Euro MP Chris Davies who leaked details of the document last month said he was delighted it was now public. ""Paul's here as a whistle-blower. They [senior parliament officials] will be angry about this but only because they will look stupid,"" he said. Among the revelations made by the internal auditors are a large number of lay-off payments made to staff of MEPs who were not re-elected. Ten were made to assistants even though they were working for another MEP. And one member of staff is said to have accumulated part-time payments from 12 MEPs over a three-month period. It's been handled very badly. This drip, drip, drip is not helpful    The auditors also refer to abuse of travel costs and expenses. In one case, the expenses amount to three times the staff member's salary. Not everyone on the budgetary control committee is impressed with Mr van Buitenen's decision to go public with the report. Fellow Dutch MEP Jan Mulder, who had originally been in favour of making the details public, said he would not have breached the secrecy order. ""If I've signed for it, then I would keep it confidential,"" he said. British Labour MEP Eluned Morgan said she had written personally to Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering, calling for the report to be made public. ""It's been handled very badly. This drip, drip, drip is not helpful. I think it should be published [in full], there's no question about that at all. This will have taken away any excuse."" A spokesman for Mr Poettering said if the rules on confidentiality had been broken, it would be up to the committee's chairman to make a complaint. Mr van Buitenen is no stranger to censure at the hands of the EU's institutions. He was formally reprimanded a few months ago after he publicised an account of a meeting held behind closed doors with the head of the EU's anti-fraud office, Olaf. More famously, he was suspended in 1999 while working as an official at the European Commission after he passed allegations of fraud in the commission on to the parliament.     "
109,"Andy Cole was joined on Wednesday by David James, Rio Ferdinand, and Kieron Dyer as the four players left out of Keegan's 22-man squad for Euro 2000. As England kicked off against Ukraine in the Euro 2000 warm-up at Wembley, Cole was nowhere to be seen. England manager Kevin Keegan's later announcement confirmed the Manchester United frontman will miss the European Championships - a lingering foot injury ruling out his chances. At a press conference held to announce the squad, Keegan stressed several times: ""Andy Cole has not been dropped. He is injured. If he had been fit, I would definitely have taken him.""    There is never an easy way to tell people in this sort of situation    The Euro 2000 dreams of the other England players were ended on Wednesday afternoon, when they were told of their fate. The midfield duo of Arsenal's Ray Parlour and Liverpool's Jamie Redknapp had already been ruled out through injury. Aston Villa's David James lost the third goalkeeping spot to Richard Wright - perhaps after the Ipswich No.1's outstanding performance in the Division One play-off final win over Barnsley. Speaking of his squad choice, Keegan said: ""Andy wasn't sure he felt quite right with his left foot - I'm sure it's the right decision and so is Andy - you'll have the chance to see that. He added: ""Credit to the others. They're all disapointed. They've taken it in the right spirit. ""There was no easy way to do it. I think I've got a good balance in the squad.    The gaffer has his own opinion and his is the one that's important so I just have to go back to West Ham and go on working hard    ""You've got to put Steven Gerrard and Gareth Barry as gambles but if you need any indication they are ready for it you probably had it on Wednesday night."" Rio Ferdinand gave his reaction at missing out on Euro 2000 and took the opportunity to wish his colleagues all the best. He said: ""I'm obviously disappointed but good luck to the boys. ""The gaffer has his own opinion and his is the one that's important so I just have to go back to West Ham and go on working hard."" The inclusion of teenager Gareth Barry in the senior squad will be a massive boost to the Aston Villa player who was only promoted from the Under-21 squad when Jason Wilcox suffered an injury. Barmby, who unlike Barry is not left-footed but can crucially play on the flank, also made the cut after being recalled to the squad by Keegan almost four years after making his previous appearance in the first match of Glenn Hoddle's reign. After the victory against Ukraine, Keegan was upbeat and hailed Gareth Barry, Nicky Barmby, Steven Gerrard and Robbie Fowler for their contributions. He said: ""Gareth gave us a lovely left foot down our side. It was a good introduction for him. ""Nicky Barmby also came on and was unlucky not to have a hand in three goals, while Steven Gerrard did really well. It wasn't any easy game to come into. ""Robbie needed the game - the 45 minutes will do him good. Goalscorers love to score goals. And he also paid tribute to goalkeeper Nigel Martyn for his two important saves. ""He kept us in the game,"" he said. ""We're blessed with some great goalkeepers in this country. Keegan was pleased his decision to use wing-backs was rewarded with another clean sheet. He continued: ""I want that flexibility. What we've shown is, whatever the system, the commitment and willingness is what has shone through more than anything. That's been a major plus."""
110,"The contest began as Mr Howard formally resigned by letter to Sir Michael Spicer, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs.  Five candidates have declared they will run for leader, with David Cameron taking over from David Davis as the favourite at the bookmakers.  Mr Howard stays on as caretaker until a replacement is named on 6 December.  Mr Howard first announced he would go shortly after the general election in May, when the Conservatives won 198 seats, a result he described as not good enough.  This week's annual party conference in Blackpool saw each declared candidate - Sir Malcolm Rifkind, David Cameron, Ken Clarke, David Davis and Liam Fox - put their case to members.  In his speech on Thursday, Mr Howard said he had feared the event going ""pear shaped"".  He added: ""Of course we need discussion and debate. But let's not be offensive about each other.  ""Let's not run down our party. Let's show we can elect a new leader without bitterness.""  Mr Davis remains the candidate with the most declared backers among MPs, but his campaign appears to have lost momentum after his conference was criticised in the press as ""lacklustre"".  Sir Malcolm Rifkind said his opponent must be ""very worried"".  But Mr Davis said he remained the frontrunner and that he would not be bowed by criticism.  The party's deputy leader, Michael Ancram, has revealed he is supporting Sir Malcolm's bid.  Meanwhile, David Cameron's team claims to be picking up more support from MPs, as an Evening Standard poll of 100 party members put him ahead of his rivals.  Conservative MPs will narrow the candidates down to two, before a vote by party members around the UK.  Mr Howard has not named his favoured successor.  Meanwhile, shadow culture secretary Theresa May has urged the Conservative Party to take ""radical action"" to win back women voters."
111,"Scenario one: The status quo Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 50 years. Currently a boundary - the Line of Control - divides the region in two, with one part administered by India and one by Pakistan. India would like to formalise this status quo and make it the accepted international boundary. But Pakistan and Kashmiri activists reject this plan because they both want greater control over the region.  In 1947-8 India and Pakistan fought their first war over Jammu and Kashmir. Under United Nations' supervision, they agreed to a ceasefire along a line which left one-third of the state - comprising what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern Areas administered by Pakistan and two-thirds, Jammu, Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley, administered by India.  In 1972, under the terms of the Simla agreement, the ceasefire line was renamed the Line of Control.  Although India claims that the entire state is part of India, it has been prepared to accept the Line of Control as the international border, with some possible modifications. Both the US and the UK have also favoured turning the Line of Control into an internationally-recognised frontier.  But Pakistan has consistently refused to accept the Line of Control as the border since the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley would remain as part of India. Formalising the status quo also does not take account of the aspirations of those Kashmiris who have been fighting since 1989 for independence for the whole or part of the state."
112,"Prince William told the 63,000-strong crowd at London's Wembley Stadium his mother would have enjoyed the tribute.  Sunday's gig marked the life of Diana, who died in a 1997 Paris car crash, on what would have been her 46th birthday.  Sir Elton John brought the concert to a close after sets by stars including Sir Tom Jones, Take That and Rod Stewart.  Prince William and Prince Harry opened the six-hour show and returned to the stage at the end of Sir Elton's final set, praising the artists for an ""incredible evening"".  ""Thank you to all of you who have come here tonight to celebrate our mother's life,"" Prince William said.  ""For us this has been the most perfect way to remember her, and this is how she would want to be remembered.""  Proceeds from the event, broadcast to 140 countries, go to charitable causes favoured by the princess.  Prince William, 25, added that he hoped the show had raised ""enough money to make a difference"".  The princes later mingled with the stars of the concert at the after-show party at Wembley Arena.  In a video tribute, ex-South African President Nelson Mandela had earlier praised Princess Diana's ""energy, courage and selfless commitment"" as he urged the crowd to ""support the work that continues in her name"".  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and ex-US President Bill Clinton were also among those who recorded video tributes to Diana.  ""I think that in William and Harry, the qualities that made Diana special live on,"" said Mr Blair.  Earlier in the concert Prince Harry paid tribute to fellow soldiers serving in Iraq.  The 22-year-old was due to be deployed in Basra, in Iraq, this year, but military commanders decided it was too much of a risk.  ""I wish I was there with you. I'm sorry I can't be. But to you and everybody else on operations at the moment, we would both like to say 'stay safe',"" he said.  Sir Elton, 60, who famously performed a reworked version of Candle in the Wind at Diana's funeral, opened the concert with a rendition of Your Song, performed in front of a giant photograph of Diana by Mario Testino.  He was followed by '80s stars Duran Duran, who played a trio of songs including Wild Boys - which they dedicated to the princes - and Rio, one of their mother's favourites.  Status Quo, Sir Tom Jones, Will Young and Joss Stone all took to the stage in the afternoon.  But rumours that Robbie Williams might join Take That on stage proved unfounded.  Some of Princes William and Harry's favourites followed, including a poignant moment when P Diddy dedicated his track I'll Be Missing You to the princess.  ""Ten years ago, Princess Diana went to a better place,"" he said. ""Today we celebrate her life and I dedicate this song to her.""  The evening wrapped up with entertainment from comedian Ricky Gervais, who was forced to improvise when technical problems caused a minor delay to Sir Elton's closing set.  ""We'll leave that to the funny people - and Ricky Gervais.""  Simon Cowell, a judge on The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, paid tribute to the princes' efforts in organising the concert.  ""You've put on one heck of a show,"" he told them.  ""In years to come, if you ever get tired of running the country, you can come and work for me producing TV shows."""
113,"Do Bigfin reef squid listen out for predatory whales?    The discovery resolves a century-long debate over whether cephalopods, the group of sea creatures that includes octopus, squid, cuttlefish and nautiluses, can hear sounds underwater. Compared to fish, octopus and squid do not appear to hear particularly well. But the fact they can hear raises the possibility that these intelligent animals may use sound to catch prey, communicate with one another or listen out for predators. The question of whether cephalopods can perceive sound has been controversial since the early 20th Century. Some experiments suggested that blind octopus seemed able to locate the sounds produced by boats or by tapping on the outside of a tank. But most cephalopods lack a gas-filled chamber, such as the swim bladders that fish can use to hear. That suggested they could not detect the pressure wave component of sound. However, sensory physiologist Hong Young Yan of the Taiwan National Academy of Science in Taipei, Taiwan suspected that octopus and squid might use another organ called the statocyst to register sound. An octopus's hearing is tuned to life on the seafloor The statocyst is a sac-like structure containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs. Fish also use it to detect sounds, and in previous research, Yan showed that prawns can use their statocysts to hear. ""So we extended our work from prawns to cephalopods,"" says Yan. Yan's team tested the auditory capabilities of two species, the Common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana, often called the Bigfin reef squid. They discovered that the octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. The squid can hear an wider range of sound from 400Hz to 1500Hz, they report in Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part A. ""That indicates that squid have a better hearing capability than the octopus,"" says Yan. ""Interestingly though, both species hear best at a frequency of 600Hz."" Yan's team had to overcome particular technical challenges to investigate the cephalopods' hearing ability. The usual way to prove that an organism can hear is to measure how its nervous system electrically responds to sound. But that can involve directly attaching electrodes to exposed nerves, an invasive procedure that could harm delicate cephalopods. So Yan invented a non-invasive method, which involves placing electrodes on an animal's body to measure the electrical activity in its brain. In this way, he could measure within just a couple of hours whether the brain of an octopus or squid responds to sound. The discovery could open up a new understanding of cephalopod behaviour. ""The key question which I would like to investigate is what kind of sounds are they listening to?"" says Yan. ""Perhaps they listen to sound to evade predators and can eavesdrop to sounds made by their prey. Or, perhaps they even could make sounds to communicate among themselves."" For example, because octopus or squid do not possess gas-filled chambers within their bodies, they cannot amplify sounds, limiting their hearing ability. But they can hear as well as invertebrates such as prawns, although less well than many species of fish and the toothed whales which often eat them. ""Squid are heavily preyed upon by toothed whales including dolphins. So perhaps their hearing would aid them to avoid the pinging sounds made by dolphins,"" says Yan. He says the different abilities of the octopus and squid also reflect the environment they live in. The common octopus dwells on the seabed, which is covered by large rocks, boulders, coral reef and other features. In water, sounds above 1000Hz have a wavelength less than 1.5m. Such sound waves cannot in turn pass objects greater than 1.5m in size, and they get deflected, which could explain why the octopus doesn't need to hear them. Squid live in the open water where there are fewer obstacles, and therefore sounds pass uninterrupted over a greater frequency range.     "
114,"Google pulled out of mainland China in March over censorship rules China has defended its right to censor the internet in a document laying out the government's attitude towards the web. It says the country has the right to govern the internet according to its own rules inside its borders. The white paper also reveals just how fast the internet has developed in China in the 16 years since it was first connected. By the end of last year the country had 384m internet users. The white paper, released on Tuesday, called the internet ""a crystallisation of human wisdom"". But in the document the government lays out some of the reasons why its citizens cannot get access to all of that wisdom. It says it wants to curb the harmful effects of illegal information on state security, public interests and children. ""Laws and regulations clearly prohibit the spread of information that contains content subverting state power, undermining national unity [or] infringing upon national honour and interests,"" it says. Websites, blogs and information deemed sensitive by the Chinese government is routinely blocked using a range of technological tools, dubbed the Great Firewall of China. The country's state secrets law has just been amended in a way that makes internet and telecommunications firms now responsible for helping the government police the web. Despite that, China still maintains that its people have unfettered access to the internet. ""Chinese citizens fully enjoy freedom of speech on the internet,"" says the white paper. In another section, China reaffirms its determination to govern the internet within its borders according to its own rules. ""Within Chinese territory the internet is under the jurisdiction of Chinese sovereignty. The internet sovereignty of China should be respected and protected,"" it says. It adds that foreign individuals and firms can use the internet in China, but they must abide by the country's laws. Google recently pulled out of mainland China, saying it was no longer willing to accept government censorship. Its Chinese-language services are now based in Hong Kong. The document also reveals just how fast the internet is developing in China. The government hopes that nearly half the population will have access to the internet within five years. That figure is nearly 30% at the moment.     "
115,"How to cut the costs of flying? It's one of the key questions facing the aviation industry.  With the price of a barrel of oil at about $100, airlines are having to think of new - and often ingenious - ways to save money.  We've had lightweight composite materials, we've had mergers and we've even had lighter drinks trolleys and thinner carpets.  Now Easyjet, one of Europe's largest airlines, thinks it has found a way to save even more money using a technology you cannot even see: a new paint job.  From Monday, it will be the first commercial airline to trial what it calls a ""revolutionary nano-technology coating"".  Easyjet hopes it will reduce drag as the plane flies through the air, increasing fuel efficiency and, ultimately, saving the airline hard cash.  The idea has been used on US military aircraft for years and the science behind it is relatively simple. The coating needs to be incredibly thin and it also has to be incredibly light.  If it was anywhere near as heavy as the paint on a plane, about 80kg for each of Easyjet's aircraft, then any savings made in fuel emissions would be lost.  The amount of polymer needed adds just 4oz (113g) to the overall weight of each jet.  The coating is applied and distributed in the UK by an organisation called TripleO. Before the slippery surface is applied, they give the plane a ""polarising wash"".  Easyjet says this opens the pores of the surface to be treated and electrically charges it with a positive polarity, thus allowing the polymer to bond to the existing paint surface.  The extra shiny layer reduces the build-up of debris on the plane's main structure, the leading edge of the wings and other areas, thus reducing friction and drag on the surface of the aircraft.  The manufacturers say it could lower Easyjet's fuel consumption by up to 2%. It may not sound like much, but in aviation terms, it amounts to a planeload.  Last year, 40% of the company's costs were on fuel, a bill of more than £730m. If the polymer had been applied across the company's fleet, and if it had reduced costs by the suggested 2%, Easyjet could have knocked £14m off that.  Easyjet's chief executive, Carolyn McCall, says customers stand to benefit: ""If we can find new ways of reducing the amount of fuel used by our aircraft, we can pass the benefits on to our passengers by offering them low fares and a lower carbon footprint.""  It is also about embracing new technology, she says.  ""Innovation and efficiency is at the DNA of everything Easyjet has ever done. This plays to both of those things. We don't know it will definitely cut 1 to 2% off our fuel bill, but that is what we are being told is possible.""  The company aren't saying how much it costs to coat each plane, but Ms McCall says ""even a 1% saving on our fuel bill and 1% less in our carbon emissions is worth doing"".  So what next for the aviation industry? Go-faster stripes? Possibly not.  But for a low-cost airline, the key is indeed cost. If the eight planes that are taking part in the trial deliver a 2% cut in fuel emissions, then the plan is to paint the rest of the 200-strong fleet, too."
116,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been sworn in for a second term as Iran's president, after weeks of post-election unrest. In an address after the ceremony, he criticised foreign powers who have cast doubt on the validity of the election, saying Iran would resist them. Opposition supporters protesting outside parliament were met by hundreds of riot police. Germany, France, Britain and the US all said they would not be sending letters of congratulation to Mr Ahmadinejad. At least 30 people died during the street protests which followed the 12 June poll. Mr Ahmadinejad now has two weeks to form a government that must then be approved by parliament. Taking his oath of office, broadcast live on state TV, Mr Ahmadinejad promised to ""protect the official faith, the system of the Islamic revolution and the constitution"". The formalities have been observed. Iran's authorities will be pleased that the show of unity was maintained as Mr Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second four-year term. For the moment the fractured Iranian establishment has come together to agree on the one thing that unites them - decrying foreign interference in their domestic affairs. Nevertheless, there was a substantial boycott by reformist members of parliament, and by leading opponents of Mr Ahmadinejad, including former President Rafsanjani. Already the conservative press is speculating about the new cabinet. The conservative Hamshahri newspaper called for the new ministers to be ""efficient, religious and prudent"" - a strong hint that conservatives have not been happy with the calibre of past ministers. The opposition has kept up its pressure on the streets. The appearance of calm and normality in Iran's affairs of state may not last very long. In the address that followed, he called for ""a national will, a national resolve"", and told his audience: ""We need to join forces."" ""I do not have any incentive other than serving the people and the country and I do not think of anything but the progress and development of the nation,"" Mr Ahmadinejad said. Following the swearing-in, he used his first address to defend the official results of the election - which gave him an overwhelming victory - and criticised Western powers' response to the disputed poll. ""Some governments should feel responsible for their words and deeds,"" he said. ""The people of Iran are for a constructive dialogue... We will resist violations of law and abuse... ""[Foreign governments] just want democracy at the service of their own interests - they do not respect the rights of other nations. They see themselves as the yardstick of democracy - our people oppose this, that's what our people are resisting,"" he said. Several states which have criticised the elections said they would not be sending customary letters of congratulations to Mr Ahmadinejad to mark his reappointment as president, including the US, Germany, France and the UK.

Outside, hundreds of demonstrators gathered. There were reports of clashes with riot police and at least one arrest. There were some notable absences for Wednesday's inauguration ceremony, though envoys from the European Union and the UK did attend. After the election I demonstrated in support of the government. This is because I see the protesters as a minority group who are trying to impose their view on the majority    Mr Ahmadinejad's predecessors as president - Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani - were missing, as they were from a formal ceremony to endorse his presidency on Monday. Also missing were two defeated opposition candidates - Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - who continue to contest the results. In addition, a reformist faction of about 70 MPs said only about 13 of its members attended - and some of those who did attend reportedly left during Mr Ahmadinejad's speech in a show of protest. Mr Ahmadinejad has received the backing of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has supported him throughout the unrest. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Mr Khamenei said Mr Ahmadinejad was the rightful winner and that Iranians had ""voted in favour of a fight against arrogance, to confront destitution and spread justice"". Meanwhile in the US, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs retracted his description of Mr Ahmadinejad as the ""elected president"" of Iran. Mr Gibbs said he had misspoken and that the US would leave it up to the Iranian people to decide whether the election was fair. The BBC's Tehran correspondent, Jon Leyne, says forming an acceptable, credible government could be the real challenge for the Iranian president. Mr Ahmadinejad has been dogged by controversy in recent weeks, becoming embroiled in a series of disputes with conservative politicians who would normally be his allies. More than 100 people, including some members of the opposition movement, went on trial in Iran on Saturday for their alleged involvement in the post-election violence. Foreign media, including the BBC, have been restricted in their coverage of Iran since the election protests turned into confrontations with the authorities in which at least 30 people were killed.

117,"Almost 100 councils are known to have deposited money in Icelandic banks Local authorities have not been ""reckless"" in investing more than £840m with Icelandic banks that have now failed, the government has said. Deposits from more than 100 councils could be at risk, the BBC has learned. Ministers have promised ""case-by-case"" help in England and Wales, but say in Scotland the issue will be dealt with by the Holyrood administration. Gordon Brown said he was considering ""further action"", but the government is not offering to guarantee the deposits. The prime minister told the BBC that the Icelandic authorities' handling of accounts had been ""effectively illegal"" and ""completely unacceptable"". The government has frozen the UK assets of Icelandic bank Landsbanki, saying local authorities will benefit from this. They have failed not only the people of Iceland; they have failed people in Britain    But Iceland's prime minister, Geir Haarde, said it was ""not very pleasant"" to have laws designed to deal with terrorists used against his country. So far local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland have revealed that they have deposits worth £842.5m in total. The figure is £946.8m when investments by police authorities and Transport for London are added. Treasury Ministers Stephen Timms and Ian Pearson and Local Government Minister John Healy held talks with the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales. In a joint statement afterwards they said: ""Government and the LGA agreed that there is no evidence of recklessness by local authorities."" They added: ""We will judge what's appropriate on a case-by-case basis but, in previous situations, support has included helping local authorities restructure their financial priorities, providing additional expertise and capitalisation of expenditure."" James Purnell, the Minister for Work and Pensions, said the government's priority was to make sure that the services provided by local authorities were not affected by the collapse. ""We met with the Local Government Association and have been discussing this with councils, and we've agreed that we want to work together obviously to protect service levels - but this is a complicated situation. ""We've agreed that we will work with them over the next few days, and that is the right way of doing it, making sure we get a proper answer."" A Treasury spokesman said any assistance for Scottish councils would come from Holyrood, as local authority matters are devolved. According to Britain-wide figures acquired by the BBC, Kent County Council has the largest deposit, worth £50m. Nottingham City Council has invested £42m, while Transport for London has £40m deposited in one of the affected banks. The Conservatives have warned that town halls could face a ""massive financial shock"" and be forced into council tax hikes or cuts in local services. ""They are not going to find it easy in the short term,"" shadow communities secretary Eric Pickles said. He added: ""We need to look at the number of authorities that will be facing a cash-flow problem - some have their payroll on this, for others it's in terms of long-term investment."" The Lib Dems said the money at stake was ""essential"" for delivering local services and urged ministers to ""make clear"" how such funding would be protected. But councils say they have followed Treasury advice by investing surplus money to deliver the highest return for taxpayers. The LGA insisted all those involved had enough money to ensure frontline services should not be affected. But it wants the same protection for councils as has been given to personal customers of IceSave and other failed Icelandic banks.     "
118,"Forty years on, the Tories are about to do it all again.  At least this time the party has for months known it must choose a new leader.  In 1963, activists travelling to the conference on a Tuesday afternoon had no inkling that ill health was about to prompt Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's shock resignation.  Macmillan's illness was news even to ministers who had seen him in Cabinet that very morning.  Veteran political journalist Anthony Howard recalls how Conservative chairman Iain Macleod went to a dinner that evening thinking everything was going perfectly.  His secretary sent a message telling him his sister was ill, thinking he would understand its real meaning.  ""I haven't got a sister, what's this rubbish,"" was Macleod's confused reaction before they managed to drag him away from the dinner.  The following night news of Macmillan's illness was relayed to Tory members.  But it was not until the Thursday of the conference that the dramatic news of the prime minister's resignation came, with Alec Douglas-Home announcing it to a shocked conference.  ""From that moment on it was absolute mayhem..."" says Anthony Howard. ""In the hall they were just stunned.""  As the news sank in, Lord Hailsham was the first to declare his hand.  That evening, Hailsham finished a lecture to Conservative activists by saying he intended to renounce his peerage so he could run for the leadership.  Geoffrey Howe, who was just starting the political career which would take him into the Cabinet, says Hailsham's announcement prompted a tremendous stranding ovation.  He remembers Anthony Howard sitting in a box alongside the stage acting as ""cheerleader"" for Hailsham - not because he was campaigning for his leadership, but because he was ""campaigning for excitement"".  ""I fear the story is true,"" admits Mr Howard, saying the temptation to urge on the crowd proved too much.  Next morning he posed for the photographers holding a baby.  ""That was considered very vulgar. He was really almost out of it by Friday,"" says Mr Howard.  John Biffen, then a backbench MP, says Hailsham's supporters did not need much encouragement to stand and clap at the lecture, although he refused to join them.  He dubbed the event ""the politics of the Nuremberg rally"" - although admits it was well-executed.  ""One was to remind people what a great orator he was, the other to remind people who wanted to be so reminded that he was an impulsive chap who couldn't be trusted. It was a 50-50.""  The issue dominated the conference, says Lord Howe: ""It was all very exciting - I can't remember what influence we thought we had.""  This was all in the days when there was no vote for the new Tory leader - they just ""emerged"" from soundings within the party.  That system meant much of the action happened back-stage, beyond the eyes of the ordinary party members at the conference.  In his memoirs, journalist and ex-Tory minister Bill Deedes says much of the talks happened in various bedrooms ""much to the distress of wives"".  ""A wife would emerge unclad from the bathroom to find her husband, still in pyjamas, talking to three totally strange men in grey suits, who would go on talking,"" he says.  ""Around the hour women like to dress up for cocktails, she would plead: 'I'm going to take my clothes off.' This would be ignored, such - we supposed - was the urgency of our consultations.""  There were essentially four candidates - Douglas-Home, Butler, Hailsham and Reggie Maudling.  Douglas-Home's candidature surprised many, not least because he had told colleagues that very week he would not enter a future leadership contest.  Anthony Howard's abiding memory is standing beside Maudling watching Douglas-Home do a television interview.  Maudling's own chances suffered by a low-key speech which failed to generate a genuine standing ovation.  That left Butler trying to make his mark.  Dismissing the advice of his supporters, he had insisted on taking the prime ministerial hotel suite upon news of Macmillan's illness - as well as the leader's speech slot in the end of conference rally.  Hit by a heavy cold, his speech failed to wow the audience.  Butler biographer Anthony Howard believes Rab was unnerved by Douglas-Home telling him shortly before the speech that he was going to have a medical test - code for announcing his own candidature.  Bill Deedes contests that the speech did not seriously affect Butler's chances.  Douglas-Home only ""emerged"" as leader after the conference, with Macmillan giving the Queen his advice on his successor from his hospital bed.  The decision prompted Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod to resign from the government in protest.  But what lessons does 1963 hold for today's Tory hopefuls, who will after all face a vote?  Anthony Howard says that conference proved decisive: ""It disposed of three candidates and left one standing - Alec Douglas- Home.""  In the same way, the impression left by today's candidates could be similarly important, he says.  He asks: Will Ken Clarke produce a rumbustious performance; will David Cameron come across as too ""wet"" and can David Davis, the one with most at stake, make a presentable speech?  Lord Howe believes there are no direct lessons to be learnt but says it is sad that a conference that should be about the party's aims will be overshadowed by leadership implications being read into everything.  His former Cabinet colleague Lord Biffen warns that a party conference is about the worst institution to help choose a new leader.  ""It does become something like a beauty contest,"" he says.  ""Oratory is all very well and really we need quite a lot of it in politics. But for calm detached assessment of the relative qualities of people who are standing it is quite difficult to get that.""  If he is right, the 1963 conference nightmare could prove 2005's recurring dream."
119,"Scientists say Russian desman numbers have halved in the past 30 years. The 20cm-long creature is unique to Russia, inhabiting ponds and river banks.  Wildlife expert Gennady Khakhin blamed the decline on the growth of riverside cottages and poachers using nylon nets.  Russian conservationists want the sale of such nets to be banned.  Spearheading the ""Save the Russian desman"" campaign, Nelli Zaripova said the image of the desman - called vykhukhol in Russian - also needed a makeover.  ""If you say the word vykhukhol people nearby start saying 'You should be ashamed, swearing like that!' It's incomprehensible that the desman has such a negative reputation,"" she said.  She said children should be taught to respect the desman, which eats insects, snails and tiny fish.  The animal is one of the oldest mammals in Eurasia. It has a long snout, thick fur and webbed feet."
120,"Playwright Alan Bennett has said budding working-class writers are being blocked from following in his footsteps by university tuition fees.  Bennett, a butcher's son from Leeds, went to Oxford University.  But he said he would not have been able to pay tuition fees, meaning his career would have taken a different path.  Young writers in a similar position have fewer opportunities than he did, he argued on a visit to his old school - Lawnswood, formerly Leeds Modern.  ""One dreads to think where one would have ended up,"" the author and scriptwriter said at the school, where he opened a library named in his honour.  He told pupils that he was ""really passionate"" about free education. He ""absolutely undoubtedly"" would not have been able to go to university if tuition fees had been in place when he was studying, he said.  Asked whether his career could have followed a similar course if he had not been to university, the History Boys and Talking Heads author replied: ""I can't see it would have done.""  He added: ""I didn't realise then how fortunate I was but soon after I left university I realised I'd been very, very lucky.""  Bennett said he feared that tuition fees would widen social divides in the coming years.  ""The top league of universities, not just at Oxford and Cambridge, they're almost wholly middle class, their intakes, now, and that's wrong,"" he said.  The funding situation also made it more difficult for working-class actors to make it to drama school than in previous years, he added.  ""You would never get people like Albert Finney going to drama school now, people from a poor background, because they wouldn't be able to afford it.""  University tuition fees in England will be increased to up to £9,000 per year from 2012. UK university applications were 13% down at the end of November compared with the same time last year.  But the government has said students do not have to pay tuition charges up front, with more financial support available for those from poorer families and lower monthly loan repayments than under the current system, which are payable only once graduates are in well-paid work.  Oxford University has said it will offer reduced fee levels for students from families earning less than £25,000 per year.  Lawnswood School dedicated its library to the writer after he emerged as a vocal campaigner against public library cuts.  He attended the school in the 1940s, when it was known as Leeds Modern.  The playwright and author said he ""loosely"" based The History Boys on his experiences at the school and his admission to Oxford.  Plans to shut local libraries were ""wrong and very short-sighted"", Bennett said, adding: ""We're impoverishing young people.""  Alongside Stephen Fry and Julian Barnes, he has signed up to contribute to a book to support library campaigners. The Library Book will be published for National Libraries Day on 4 February."
121,"The FAI says it has received a letter from international body Fifa which makes clear Northern Ireland-born players can represent the Republic.  However, the IFA has a different interpretation of the Fifa rules.  Former NI under-age players Tony Kane and Michael O'Connor made Republic under-21 debuts last week.  And Londonderry-born Manchester United player Darron Gibson and Portsmouth's Marc Wilson have been included in several recent Republic of Ireland under-21 squads.  IFA Chief Executive Howard Wells recently raised the issue at a meeting of his organisation's executive committee and then wrote a letter to Fifa ""expressing concern and seeking advice and clarification"".  The IFA contends that for Northern Ireland-born players to represent the Republic that either a parent or grandparent has to be born in the Republic or the player has to have lived there for at least two years.  However, the FAI's stance on the issue is at variance with the Northern Ireland football governing body.  ""On October 20, Fifa's Heinz Tannler, Director of Legal Division, and Corina Luck, Head of General Legal, wrote a joint letter to the IFA, which was copied to the FAI,"" said a FAI statement published in the Irish News.  ""In it, they informed the IFA that 'the existing situation in Northern Ireland allows players to choose whether they wish to represent Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland'.""  The FAI added that it is scheduled to meet with IFA officials next month when ""eligibility will be one of the topics up for discussion""."
122,"Archaeologists believe they have uncovered an 1,800-year-old murder mystery in Northumberland.  During a dig at Vindolanda Roman fort, the skeleton of a child, aged between eight and 10, was found in a shallow pit in the corner of a barrack-room.  Foul play is suspected, because human burials in built-up areas were strictly forbidden in Roman times.  It is thought the remains were those of a girl, and the position indicates that her hands could have been tied.  When the bones were first discovered, it was at first thought they were those of a large dog.  However, examinations by experts at Durham University revealed that they were the remains of a child.  The pit in the barracks has been dated to the middle of the 3rd Century, when the Fourth Cohort of Gauls formed the garrison.  At that time the dead had to be interred or cremated in cemeteries on the outskirts of towns or barracks, so the concealment of a body in this fashion would have been a criminal act.  Andrew Birley, Vindolanda's director of excavation, said that it was not the first time an excavation of a Roman fort alongside Hadrian's Wall had uncovered a murder victim.  ""In the 1930s my grandfather, Eric Birley, found two skeletons concealed below a floor in a civilian building at Housesteads.  ""One had the blade of a knife stuck in the ribs, and the later coroner's inquest duly produced a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown, shortly before AD367.  ""I'm sorry to say that Vindolanda has probably produced another Roman murder victim.  ""I shudder to think how this young person met their fate.""  Once the forensic examination at Durham University has been completed, the skeleton will be put on view at Vindolanda Museum."
123,"A police officer has been killed and ten people injured after shots were fired from the Libyan People's Bureau in central London.  WPC Yvonne Fletcher had been helping control a small demonstration outside the embassy when automatic gunfire came from outside.  She received a fatal stomach wound and some of the demonstrators were also severely injured.  WPC Fletcher, 25, died soon afterwards at Westminster Hospital.  Her fiancé, another police officer who was also at the demonstration, was at her side.  After the shooting people were cleared from surrounding offices in St James' Square.  Some had witnessed events from their workplace.  Film maker Ray Barker said people were stunned by what had happened.  ""Several of my colleagues burst into tears. It was unbelievable that sort of thing could happen at such an insignificant demonstration,"" he said.  Journalist Brian Cartmell was in St James' Square just feet away from Yvonne Fletcher when she was hit.  ""She crumpled to the floor clutching her lower stomach and groin and rolled on to her right-hand side with a look of total surprise on her pretty face,"" Mr Cartmell said.  The Libyan building is now surrounded by armed police officers including specialist marksmen.  However, Home Secretary Leon Brittan has said the police are prepared to wait and deal with the situation in a peaceful way.  Police officers are in touch with those inside the Libyan People's Bureau via a special telephone link.  The Libyans, led by Colonel Gaddafi, are blaming Britain's police and security forces for ""attacking"" their embassy.  Libyan soldiers have now surrounded Britain's embassy in Tripoli trapping 18 diplomats inside."
124,"Paul Shane, the actor famous for starring in the 1980s BBC sitcom Hi-de-Hi!, has died, his agent has confirmed.  The 72-year-old, she said, died surrounded by close family at a hospice in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Thursday after a short illness.  He leaves behind his three daughters and six grandchildren. His wife died in 2001.  Shane made his name playing entertainer Ted Bovis in Hi-de-Hi!, a long-running TV series set in a holiday camp.  He later appeared in You Rang, M'Lord? alongside some of the former Hi-de-Hi! cast members.  These included Su Pollard, who called her co-star ""absolutely gorgeous"".  Pollard - who played hapless cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw - remained friends with Shane throughout his life and visited him just days before he died.  ""I just remember the great fun we had, always laughing, every single day,"" Pollard told BBC Breakfast.  She said Shane had ""a quiet, reflective side"" but was a born entertainer ""deep down in his heart"". ""He would never be the one to push himself forward,"" she said on Friday.  ""But as soon as he was Ted Bovis... he came into his own. There was very definitely two sides to him, but [they were] equally lovely"".  Fans have also been paying tribute on Twitter. Among them was comedian and actor Ricky Gervais, who called him an ""old school Britcom hero"", and former EastEnders actor Shaun Williamson, who wrote ""RIP Comedy Legend"".  Shane, born in Rotherham in 1940, began his working life as a miner but turned to the entertainment industry following an accident.  In his early career, he sang and entertained in pubs and clubs across South Yorkshire until he was offered TV work in the early 1970s.  His big break came with the BBC hit Hi-de-Hi! in 1980, written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft.  The series, which ran until 1988, won large audiences and a Bafta for best comedy series in 1984.  Linda Kramer, his agent for 15 years, said Paul had loved playing the character of Ted.  She added that he was paid the ""ultimate tribute"" of being the subject of This is Your Life, the biographical TV show, in 1981.  Shane also worked on 1990s BBC sitcom Oh Doctor Beeching!, as well as Emmerdale, Common as Muck, Doctors and Holby City.  He gave his last TV acting performance in 2008 as 'Deisel Bob' in A Touch of Frost."
125,"The Ashes are under way in England, but another historic sporting battle is fought out every year in Florence - an ancient no-holds-barred ball game played in one of the city's most famous piazzas, as writer Sarah Dunant explains.  Britain is a happy nation this week. The sun has shone and we've won a major sporting tournament.  I say we, because although obviously our new national hero did the physically gruelling bit, we've had our own work-out too. Tennis - like cricket, football, athletics, etc - may be a game, but it's only a sport when you have spectators to amplify the contest. Pumping the energy, riding the adrenaline spikes, aggression, exhilaration, outrage, even the occasional increased heart rate as we leap up from our sofa.  At the end, triumph or failure. With luck and without immediate access to too much alcohol, both sides can enjoy the catharsis of all emotion spent. Thus in theory, throughout history, sport has proved a creative alternative to our recurring tendency to kill each other.  Which brings me to Florence, where I work part of the year and where we're also recovering from annual sporting therapy, in this case a much less gentlemanly ball game that takes place in a giant sandpit in the middle of the city.  No one knows exactly when ""Calcio Storico"" - historic football - was first played here, but its pitch, the piazza of Santa Croce, dates from the 14th Century and the rules of the game - in so far as there are any - were written down in the late 1500s. The four quarters of the city - Santa Spiritu, San Giovanni, Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce, named for their great local churches - each put up a team of 27 men.  The aim, over two heats and a final, is for players to get the ball over the 4ft (1.2m) fence at either end of the pitch. To achieve this, players can use both hands and feet, as well as every other part of the body when it comes to wrestling, punching and generally immobilising their opponents on the way. In other words - sport as muted warfare.  A 15th Century Florentine would still recognise much of the event. Each game is preceded by trumpet fanfares and marching drums as costumed dignitaries and flag-throwers in the rich hot renaissance colours of their teams march from their various quarters to the piazza. The only concession to sartorial modernity - the players' coloured t-shirts with sponsors' logos - are off within minutes of getting onto the pitch, so that all one can see is naked upper torsos, caked with sand and sweat, hurling themselves at each other, as the crowd roars its approval and each goal, or caccia, is greeted by cannon fire.  The addition of tourism has done little to blunt the edge of civic competition and not-so-benign thuggery that comes with it. Time travel works both ways, and watching from my window as the teams arrive (in the Renaissance most respectable women wouldn't have been allowed out anyway), you get a distinct whiff of a darker, more physical past, where the streets were often full of excess testosterone looking for action.  Italian Renaissance city-states were tiny affairs compared to modern conurbations, but rivalries between prominent families and gang warfare (think Verona and the Capulets and Montagues) were always simmering under the surface. Smarter authorities found civic ways to let off steam.  There was Siena and its Palio - different quarters of the city slugging it out on a death-track horse race. And Venice for centuries had a spectacularly violent sport of bridge fighting. Imagine this as your local sporting fixture - on big public holidays (of which there were many), a battalion of fishermen would meet an equal number of pumped-up ship workers at a pre-arranged bridge - there is one still known as Ponte dei Pugni (""bridge of fists"") - and, armed with sticks and staves tipped in boiling oil, beat the hell out of each other until, by falling back or into the water, one side was vanquished and the bridge was taken.  There were injuries and deaths but there were also stars - a number of Beckhams and Bests, though I am sure less good looking - who became local celebrities. There were also the corporate or royal boxes where the ruling families and visiting dignitaries could get a superior view of the action from specially constructed rafts moored nearby. In 1574 Henry III of France visited Venice and attended one such fight put on in his honour. His verdict: ""Too small to be a real war and too cruel to be a game.""  Horse-racing through winding streets, bridge fights in a city of water - while today we spend millions on sports stadiums (as much a way to control the crowds as the sport), they used what they already had. But then, one of the great things about Renaissance culture is that early on, it perfected an ideal architectural form which encouraged both containment and celebration - the piazza or city square. And they don't come any more heavily used than that football pitch in Florence.  The Franciscans who built the great church of Santa Croce, which dominates the piazza, picked the area because it was poor. Close to the river, this was where the dyers lived. Here, from great vats of scalding water, Florence's mercantile fortune emerged. Raw dull fabric was imported from all over Europe and turned into rainbow colours to feed the appetite of growing fashionable middle classes. Walk into any church and you see the results pulsating off the walls: frescoes telling biblical stories but set in contemporary 15th Century, the background figures often local citizens dressed to the nines.  But if the original inhabitants of Santa Croce didn't share in the wealth, they did enjoy some of the spectacle. It was in their piazza that the Medici family celebrated the wedding of Lorenzo (soon to be the Magnificent) with a tournament. They also had prime access to one of the great preachers of the age, San Bernardino, whose hellfire sermons were so compelling that the congregation spilt out of the cavernous church to fill the great space outside.  In recent years there have been modern prophets. Since they moved the 19th Century marble statue of Dante from the middle of the piazza to its current position on the steps of the church, the piazza has become the perfect venue for outdoor rock concerts. Here, during a balmy September night four years ago, I had my own form of epiphany, enthralled by the musical sermons of Leonard Cohen. I remember wondering then what Dante would have made of it all, though the real challenge to his famously disapproving marble features was last year when the Italian actor Roberto Benigni came to Santa Croce for his famous recitation of cantos from the Inferno. He returns next week for the final circles of hell to an expected audience of 60,000 a night.  Of course the square has seen disaster as well as wonders. Despite irregular flooding, nothing prepared Florence for the night in November 1966 when the Arno broke its banks and the black waters engulfed the state archives and the great church, reaching as high as the Cimabue crucifix hanging in the nave. It was a national disaster, which in turn spurred an international rescue effort. Thousands of volunteers came from all over the world to help in the clean-up operation.  But in the end, as with all great civic spaces, it's the piazza's everyday existence that gives it power. Though Santa Croce may be richer these days, it is still full of little apartments, many with limited access to light or outside space. The piazza is our public playground. Early morning dog-walkers, children on scooters and bikes, the occasional market, the hordes of tourists and the buskers, painters and the souvenir sellers who swarm around them.  The best time of day is the early evening when the sunset watchers gather on the steps of the church. Many are American students looking forward to an evening's bar crawl, something their age would deny them back home. My favourites are the Paris Hilton lookalikes, who totter across the flagstones on vertiginous heels that would have been a challenge to the stilts worn by Venetian courtesans 500 years ago. Commerce, concerts, sport and the endless theatre of people watching - Santa Croce has it all.  Talking of sport, I bet you'd like to know the result of this year's Calcio Storico. It was dramatic stuff. The final, usually played on 24 June, the feast day of St John, had to be cancelled due to torrential rains. In true Calcio spirit the blues and the whites were actually inside the sodden sand pit vigorously disagreeing about whether or not to play, when it was officially stopped for safety reasons.  When it took place six days later, the winners were - yes! - the blues from Santa Croce. It was clearly a cathartic encounter - a fifth of the players were sent off for violent behaviour - and the celebrations that followed were, well, full-blooded. I know this because I was awake most of the night listening to them. That's another thing that hasn't changed in Florence. Those pavement stones echo as much in the present as they did in the past.

126,"Low levels of radioactivity have been discovered in the cooling waters of a nuclear submarine test reactor at Dounreay, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has said.  Mr Hammond told MPs that no leak had occurred and said there were no safety implications for staff working on the site, or risks to the environment.  But, as a result, HMS Vanguard is to be refuelled with a new nuclear core at a cost of £120m.  The problem was discovered in 2012.  Labour criticised the government for not announcing the information earlier, calling it a matter of ""national importance"".  Although the news is only being made public now, the Ministry of Defence says the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the defence nuclear inspectorate were kept informed.  Mr Hammond said the Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment ran at higher levels of intensity than those on Britain's fleet of nuclear submarines and was designed to pre-empt any similar problems with the reactors on board those vessels.  The defence secretary said: ""These low levels of radioactivity are a normal product of a nuclear reaction that takes place within the fuel but they would not normally enter the cooling water.  ""This water is contained within the sealed reactor circuit and I can reassure the House there has been no detectable radiation leak from that sealed circuit.  ""Indeed, against the International Atomic Energy Agency's measurement scale for nuclear-related events this issue is classed Level 0, described as 'below scale - no safety significance'.""  The refuelling of HMS Vanguard - the UK's oldest nuclear submarine - will take place during its next scheduled ""deep maintenance period"", due to last three and a half years from 2015.  Mr Hammond said: ""This is the responsible option: replacing the core on a precautionary basis at the next opportunity, rather than waiting to see if the core needs to be replaced at a later date which would mean returning Vanguard for a period of unscheduled deep maintenance, potentially putting at risk the resilience of our ballistic missile submarine operations.""  Mr Hammond said a decision on refuelling the next-oldest submarine, HMS Victorious, would not need to be taken until 2018.  New submarines for the Trident replacement programme, known as the Successor submarines, will not be affected by the problem, he added.  For Labour, shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said the government should have told the Commons earlier about the fault.  He added: ""There must be public confidence in the government to be open and transparent on these matters.  ""A fault, however small, that develops in a nuclear reactor is something that the British people and this House should have been told about. This is an issue of national security and national importance."""
127,"Ms Englaro is said to have opposed being kept alive artificially A political standoff has developed in Italy over the right of a woman who has been in a coma for 17 years to die, despite a court ruling in her favour. Italy's PM drafted an emergency decree to prevent feeding tubes being removed, but the president refused to sign it. Doctors quoted by local media said they had begun withholding food on Friday and a lawyer said her family would continue moves to allow her to die. Eluana Englaro, now 38, has been in a coma since a car crash in 1992. The case has provoked fierce debate in the country. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's position is supported by the Roman Catholic Church. Last Sunday, Pope Benedict XVI added his voice to the debate about euthanasia, calling it a ""false solution"" to the tragedy of suffering. Italy's President, Giorgio Napolitano, said Mr Berlusconi had acted unconstitutionally when he issued an emergency decree to prevent the woman's life-support machine from being disconnected. He accused Mr Berlusconi of over-ruling a previous court decision to allow Ms Englaro to die. Mr Berlusconi, who has a parliamentary majority, said an emergency session of parliament would enact a new law barring doctors halting nutrition to patients in a coma. On Saturday he said he was ""amazed that doctors who have vowed to save human lives can take part in the act that will surely lead to death, even cruelly by depriving the organism of food,"" AFP news agency reported. On Tuesday Ms Englaro was transferred to a private geriatric clinic in the northern city of Udine, where doctors had agreed to disconnect her feeding tubes. A lawyer for the Englaro family, Giuseppe Campeis, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera: ""We are continuing with our (medical) procedure aimed at ensuring a 'gentle death'. According to medical experts quoted by the paper, the process should become irreversible within three to five days. Another report said it could take Ms Englaro about two weeks to die. Last year Ms Englaro's father won a court battle allowing her to die. He said that before the accident, she had expressed a wish not be kept alive artificially."
128,"They trailed 12-9 with just two minutes left when Frederic Michalak slotted a simple penalty to force extra-time.  Michalak edged Toulouse ahead with a further penalty before David Skrela, who kicked all of Stade's points in the match, missed a chance to level.  Michalak then made sure of the win with a long-range drop goal.  It was tough luck on Skrela, who only missed one kick all afternoon, but in the end Toulouse were worth their victory in only the second game in this season's tournament to feature no tries.  Stade Francais number 10 Skrela converted four penalties in the first half, while Jean-Baptiste Elissalde responded with two for Toulouse, who included Wales captain Gareth Thomas in their starting line-up.  Elissalde added another in the second half before Michalak took over kicking duties.  The Toulouse celebrations were marred by a bizarre incident as their coach Guy Noves was led away by the police after an apparent altercation with stewards at the end of the game.  The match started with Toulouse going close from a Michalak cross-kick but the Stade Francais pack then took the upper hand.  They initially established superiority in the scrums and although Toulouse fought back in that phase of the game, they continued to struggle in the lineout.  The Stade Francais lineout functioned far better and they put Toulouse under pressure on their own throw throughout the game.  And although it failed to bring an end product in terms of the result it meant Toulouse failed to secure enough good possession.  Toulouse infringements gave the Paris side the chance to take an early 6-0 lead through two Skrela penalties.  It was a hard-fought first 40 minutes and both kickers added two further penalties to make it 12-6 at the break.  Sadly for Stade Francis that was the end of their scoring, although they did not help themselves with their conservative game plan.  Toulouse took a long time to get going but they cut the gap to three points after 49 minutes and finally drew level through Michalak's penalty with three minutes to go.  From then on they looked the more likely winners and Michalak slotted a further penalty and a drop goal to give Toulouse victory."
129,"Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir has had a chequered history of elections reflecting the troubled politics of the state since its accession to India in 1947.  The first elections were held to the state's constituent-cum-legislative assembly in 1951.  It was a time when the influence of Sheikh Abdullah - the key figure in Kashmiri politics - was at its height and nobody from the opposition stood so ruling party candidates were returned unchallenged.  Sheikh Abdullah eventually fell out of favour with Delhi and was dismissed and jailed in 1953. But subsequent elections - in 1957, 1962 and 1967 - were widely regarded as being little better.  A prominent lawyer, Ghulam Nabi Hagroo, says that the elected MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) came to be known as ""made by Khaliq.""  This was a reference to a certain returning officer, Abdul Khaliq Malik, who was alleged to have found all sorts of ways to reject the nominations of any opposition candidates.  Sheikh Abdullah returned to the mainstream of Indian politics after an accord with the then Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, in the mid-1970s.  His National Conference party participated in the polls of 1977, which saw the largest turn-out of voters so far.  Although the state was then under direct Indian rule, the government in Delhi made it clear to everyone who mattered that it wanted a fair poll.  Sheikh Abdullah won a landslide victory, and his son and successor, Farooq Abdullah, won a huge majority in the elections of 1983.  But Farooq Abdullah fell out with India's ruling Congress party and the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, who had him dismissed the very next year.  But when Farooq Abdullah later agreed to an alliance with Congress, it turned many of supporters against him. It is widely believed that the elections of 1987 were rigged in favour of Mr Abdullah's party.  A leader of the Congress Party at the time, Khem Lata Wukhloo, recalls: ""I remember that there was a massive rigging in 1987 elections. The losing candidates were declared winners. It shook the ordinary people's faith in the elections and the democratic process.""  Many believe that these elections were a turning point in the history of Kashmir.  Many parties - like the Jamaat-e-Islami, the People's Conference and the Ittihad-ul-Muslimeen which were on the losing side - are now part of the main separatist alliance, the All Party Hurriyat Conference, campaigning for self-determination of the Kashmiri people.  More importantly, key figures in militant groups fighting against Indian rule - took part in the 1987 polls.  The APHC Chairman, Abdul Gani Bhat says the outcome seriously disillusioned many Kashmiris.  ""Kashmiri youths participated in the 1987 elections with great enthusiasm and seriousness and after due thought. But the poll results fired them with anger. They decided to fight violence with violence.""  Ever since the outbreak of the insurgency in 1989, militant groups have boycotted the polls on the grounds that they can't be a substitute for a plebiscite.  The elections of 1996 were held amid widespread allegations by ordinary people that the Indian troops coerced them into voting.  And the turnout was not more than 10% cent anywhere in the Kashmir Valley.  Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has promised that these latest elections n the state will be free and fair.  But the separatists have once again refused to participate, saying that they are not interested in governance till the basic issue of Kashmir has been resolved."
130,"   Ferrari have announced that double world champion Fernando Alonso will join them for 2010 from Renault, with Kimi Raikkonen making way. Ferrari said the Spaniard had signed a three-year contract and that he would partner Brazilian Felipe Massa. ""Driving a single-seater for the Prancing Horse is everybody's dream in F1, and now I have the chance to make this dream come true,"" said Alonso. The 28-year-old said the move had been brought forward by a year. Alonso's switch to Ferrari had been the worst-kept secret in F1, and the announcement is likely to trigger a string of driver moves. ""I'm very happy and very proud to become a Ferrari driver,"" said Alonso. I can't wait to start working with my new team    ""Above all I want to thank Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo, who really wanted this three-year contract. ""We had an agreement this summer, starting in 2011, but then over the last few days the picture changed and we decided to anticipate my arrival in Maranello by one year."" ""After this season [which has three races remaining] I will put all my effort into next,"" he added. ""I'm sure, together with Felipe, we'll offer Ferrari and the fans from all over the world some great satisfaction. I can't wait to start working with my new team."" Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali, who described Alonso as an ""amazing talent"", paid tribute to Raikkonen's contribution to the team. ""We wish to thank Kimi for everything he has done during his time with Ferrari,"" he said. ""In his first year with us he managed to win the drivers' title [in 2007], so making his contribution to Ferrari's history, and he played a vital role in our taking of the constructors' title in 2007 and 2008."" The Finn is tipped to join McLaren-Mercedes although a spokesman said the Anglo-German team had yet to make a decision on a team-mate for Lewis Hamilton. Raikkonen added: ""I am very sad to be leaving a team with whom I have spent three fantastic years. ""I have always felt at home with everyone here, and I will have many happy memories of my time with the team."" Fernando Alonso's move to Ferrari is the most exciting shift in the Formula 1 fabric for years    F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone gave Alonso's Ferrari switch his blessing: ""It is good. Good for Fernando, good for Formula 1, good for Ferrari."" As part of the cascade of driver moves that will follow Alonso's switch, BMW Sauber's Robert Kubica is understood to have signed a contract to replace Alonso at Renault. Alonso's switch to Ferrari has been an open secret in F1 for weeks and BBC Sport understands he signed his contract as long ago as July 2008. A Ferrari source told BBC Sport there are options to extend Alonso's deal, and that he will be earning an annual salary in the region of 19-25 million euros (£17.3-£22.8m). Raikkonen had a contract with Ferrari until the end of 2010, but the team have negotiated an early release. Massa is recovering at home in Brazil after suffering a fractured skull in an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix in July. Ferrari's expectations that he will return fully fit in 2010 have been boosted by his progress: on Monday he tested a kart for the first time since his accident and he is flying to Italy to use Ferrari's simulator next week. Italian Giancarlo Fisichella, who is standing in for Massa in the final few races of the season, will be Ferrari's test and reserve driver in 2010. Alonso's move brings to an end his relationship with Renault, for whom he has driven in all but two of his eight years in F1. He was cleared of any involvement in the recent race-fixing scandal, in which Renault were found to have asked his team-mate Nelson Piquet Jr to crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to aid Alonso's chances of victory. Alonso, not Raikkonen, will be wearing the red overalls of Ferrari in 2010 Alonso made his F1 debut for Minardi in 2001, moved to Renault as their test driver in 2002 and was promoted to their race team in 2003. He became the youngest race-winner in F1 history when he won the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix, and its youngest world champion in 2005, though he has lost those marks to Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton. Alonso went on to win a second consecutive championship in 2006, beating Ferrari's Michael Schumacher in a straight fight, before moving to McLaren as Hamilton's team-mate in 2007. However, his relationship with the team was tempestuous and he left after just one season to rejoin Renault. On his return he won the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix and, with one of his best performances, the following race in Japan, but the team have been uncompetitive this season.     "
131,"As Delhi prepares to mark 100 years as India's capital, a previously lost diary written by an Anglo-Irish aristocrat has provided a fascinating insight into an extraordinary but largely forgotten act of dissent against colonial rule by an Indian maharajah.  Lilah Wingfield witnessed the moment 100 years ago when, in front of 100,000 spectators, the Gaekwar of Baroda, otherwise known as Maharajah Sayyaji Rao III, bowed improperly when presenting himself before the British monarch, then turned his back disrespectfully and walked away.  It was an audacious act of defiance at an event that contemporary observers have described as a thousand times grander than royal weddings over the past 60 years in London.  The 1911 Delhi durbar, or mass assembly - when George V was proclaimed Emperor of India - was the only such assembly to be attended by a British monarch in person.  The durbar was a display of unparalleled grandeur attended by nearly all of the great and the good in British India, who stayed in a tented city near Delhi that accommodated 250,000 visitors, guests and their servants.  Each Indian ruler or ""native prince"" was expected to perform proper obeisance to the King-Emperor by bowing three times before him, then backing away without turning.  The maharajah not only ignored royal etiquette by turning his back on the king and queen after formally introducing himself but compounded his perceived insolence by reportedly ""laughing disrespectfully"" as he departed from their presence.  Lilah Wingfield's observations are recorded in a book by her granddaughter, Jessica Douglas-Home, about her travels in India at a time when it is now realised that British colonial rule had reached its zenith. Within 40 years, India would be independent.  Although Mrs Douglas-Home inherited her grandmother's photos of the durbar, the diary detailing Miss Wingfield's views of the event was lost for many years before being discovered in an English secondhand bookshop and sent on to her.  ""They reveal that the Gaekwar of Baroda - second in importance only to the Nizam of Hyderabad - broke every rule in [Viceroy of India] Lord Hardinge's book,"" Mrs Douglas-Home writes in A Glimpse of Empire.  ""He arrived at the amphitheatre in full dress and covered in the historic Baroda jewels, but removed them all just before the moment came for him to approach the king.  ""On reaching the shamiana (dais) he made a cursory bow from the waist, stepped backwards and then, wheeling around, turned his back on the royal couple and walked from their presence nonchalantly twirling a gold-topped walking stick.""  Mrs Douglas-Home said the maharajah's gesture caused shock among British officials attending the event.  From then until his death in 1939 he was for the most part ostracised by the British authorities even though he wrote a letter of apology soon afterwards which said that if he had not seemed to conform to the ritual, it was due to ""nervousness and confusion in the presence of Their Majesties"".  The maharajah was partly rehabilitated in 1919 when he was made a Knight Grand Commander by the British.  The actions of the maharajah are today seen by Indian and British historians as coinciding with the beginning of the end of British rule in India.  ""It was a brave and symbolic act of resistance carried out at an enormous event in front of anybody who was anyone in British India,"" says Anna Jackson, head of the Asian department of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  ""No-one could have predicted that barely three decades later the entire British edifice would collapse.  ""The event was supposed to be a show of strength in which Indian royal families paid homage to their king.""  Indian historian Amar Farooqi says that while the maharajah's actions showed ""commendable bravery"" it was not at the time - or in later years - given as much attention as it merited.  ""It was one of the strongest gestures of dissent by a princely ruler,"" he said, ""and took place against a backdrop of growing support for India's independence movement.""  Prof Farooqi says that while the British played down the maharajah's dissent, few Indians - apart from well-connected nationalist leaders - would even have known that it had happened.  ""It is not recognised much now because nationalists campaigning for Indian independence at the time and in later years did not want to be associated with princely rulers,"" Prof Farooqi said. ""Their perceived decadence was a source of some embarrassment.  ""They wanted that part of the independence struggle to be be deleted from history because maharajahs were seen as too closely associated with the worst excesses of the Raj.  ""That is why today in India so few schoolchildren know about the rulers of princely states. Princely India simply does not exist in the textbooks"".  Prof Farooqi says, however, that the maharajah has received recognition for the pioneering reforms he introduced - many ahead of their time - in Baroda.  He was the first Indian ruler to introduce compulsory and free primary education in his state in 1906, placing it far in advance of the rest of British India.  In addition he played a key role in the development of Baroda's textile and banking industries, expanded women's rights, improved access to education, banned child marriages and legislated against discrimination between different castes.  But he is probably most widely remembered in India today for his decision in 1913 to finance three years of postgraduate studies for BR Ambedkar, revered as the principal author of the Indian constitution, at Columbia University.  The maharajah's legacy is one which his grandson, Ranjitsinh Gaekwad, says is a ""constant source of pride"".  ""At that time it boosted the morale of all those working towards achieving independence for India,"" he said.  ""He wanted to instil in his countrymen a sense of pride and self esteem, which he achieved by this and many other actions. Baroda state was the one of the best administered states of British India."""
132,"The Dutch coach has enjoyed a successful start to the season, with Spurs currently lying in second place in the Premiership after three games.  ""I've always been fully committed to this great club and am delighted that it has such confidence in me,"" he said.  ""The club has assembled probably the youngest squad in the Premiership and optimism is high.""  Jol joined the club as assistant boss to Jacques Santini last summer but took over in November when Santini resigned.  He has presided over an overhaul of the squad and masterminded the signing of Edgar Davids three weeks ago."
133,"Defence lawyers had argued Bernard Ngoepe might be biased as he issued warrants for a search of Mr Zuma's offices in a corruption case last year.  It is alleged that Mr Zuma raped a family friend - a woman in her 30s - at his home in Johannesburg last November.  Mr Zuma, 63, denied the charges when the trial began in the city on Monday.  He was one of the country's most popular politicians but he was sacked from the government last year. He also faces separate charges of corruption.  Judge Ngoepe announced his decision soon after the trial began.  ""For the protection of the credibility of the judiciary... I have decided to step aside,"" he said.  ""I have concluded that protection of the credibility of the judiciary and above all the acceptability of its judgments are factors which should weigh with me heavily.""  The new judge will be one of his deputies but has not yet been named. The trial is to resume on Tuesday.  The BBC's Justin Pearce in Johannesburg says many of Mr Zuma's supporters say he is the victim of a political conspiracy and have accused the judicial system of bias.  Up to 1,000 people had gathered to back the former deputy president outside the city's High Court on Monday.  The immediate area outside the court was cordoned off but some of Mr Zuma's supporters got through.  They were singing, dancing to pro-Zuma pop songs and waving placards. ""You are the best JZ,"" read one.  There was also a separate group of about 50 anti-rape protesters.  ""This sounds like a party,"" she said, referring to the Zuma supporters. ""Rape is not a party.""  The alleged victim entered court with a headscarf over her face to shield her from the Zuma supporters.  Mr Zuma is a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid. At one stage he was championed by trade unionists and those on the political left as a likely presidential candidate to succeed Thabo Mbeki.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  The charges of rape and corruption, for which he is to face trial in July, appear to have left his political career in tatters."
134,"An overview of the plan for the 2012 Olympics in London. On 15 March 2007 the government announced the budget for the Games had risen from £2.4bn to £9.35bn, although she said the cost of the Games would be £5.3bn. New venues will cost £3.1bn. These include the Olympic Park at Stratford and the athletes' village. There will be £1.7bn spent on regeneration and infrastructure. £600m will be spent on extra security. The government has set aside £2.7bn in a contingency fund in case costs rise further. The Olympics will have to pay an £840m tax bill. £390m will be spent on other costs, such as the Paralympics and community sport. Income: The government will provide £6bn, with other funds coming from London council tax payers and the National Lottery. Further income will come from International Olympic Committee TV and marketing deals (£560m); sponsorship and official suppliers (£450m); ticket revenues (£300m); licensing (£60m); London Development Agency (£250m) There will be 9.6 million tickets for sale - 8 million for the Olympics and 1.6 million for the Paralympics. Organisers say 75% of all tickets will cost less than £50 and offer free travel on London transport. A sell-out rate of 82% for the Olympic Games and 63% for the Paralympics is estimated. Tickets for the athletics will start at £15 and there will be 20,000 £10 tickets for the Olympic Park to watch events on big screens. An aerial view of London's planned Olympic Park for 2012    Olympic Village   The village will have 17,320 beds and provide each athlete with 16 square metres' floor space. Each apartment will have a TV, internet access, a private courtyard. The dining hall will cater for 5,500 athletes at a time. The Olympic Village Polyclinic will be converted into a lifelong learning centre for the east London community, with a nursery, primary and secondary schools. The village will be converted into 3,600 apartments. Most of them will be affordable housing. The media and press centre would become a creative industries centre for east London. After the Games four arenas would be 'deconstructed' and relocated to other parts of the UK along with the swimming pools that are used for water polo and the 50m training pools. Charities will be given the sports equipment used in the Games for free. Tessa Jowell will be Olympics Minister, responsible for delivering the Games. Government will create an Olympic Delivery Authority to ensure delivery of Olympic infrastructure and new venues. There will also be a Cabinet-level Olympic Security Committee to co-ordinate all security planning. 80% of athletes would be within 20 minutes of their events and 97% of athletes within 30 minutes of their events. 93% of training venues are to be within 30 minutes of the athletes village. The aim is for 90% of venues to be served by three or more forms of public transport. There will be two major park and ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars, within 25 minutes of the Olympic Park. There are 9,000 planned park and ride spaces to be made available at Ebbsfleet where spectators can board a 10-minute shuttle service to the Olympic Park. This is the same station where continental spectators travelling by Eurostar will join the shuttle to the Olympic Park. It is predicted that on event days 78% of spectators are likely to travel from within London and 22% from the rest of the UK and Europe. Organisers estimate 80% of visitors and staff of the Games will use rail services to reach the Olympic Park. Low or no-emission vehicles will be used to transport Olympic athletes and officials. A tri-generation plant will supply electricity, heat and chilled water to the Olympic Park using technology which produces 33% lower CO2 emissions than from the electricity grid. By 2012 it is estimated that over 135,000 hotel rooms will be available within 50km of the Olympic Park, up from 120,000 presently. According to London 2012, for the first time in any Games live Olympic backdrop presentation facilities will be available to broadcast rights holders via rooftop studios on the main press centre with a direct view of the Olympic Stadium and Park.

136,"What do you get if you combine the world's most famous secret agent with a generous dose of Saved by the Bell ? One reaction might be to suggest TeenAgent, or any number of dubious efforts to present teenage spies. But what if it was a cartoon?  Well, what you get is a series that fills half-an-hour of a child's time and provides some harmless entertainment for any tolerant adult. James Bond Jr offered us the adventures of the famous 007's teenage nephew and gave children the chance to view action and gadgets without worrying about any restrictive film rating.  James Bond Jr, nephew to the well-known secret agent, attends a private school - Warfield Prep School - in the heart of England. The school is attended by a number of other vaguely familiar characters like IQ, grandson of Q, the Bond gadget-master, and Gordo Leiter, surfer-dude son of Bond's occasional CIA contact Felix. The programmes are also padded out with standard stereotypes like a crotchety, but occasionally reasonable, headmaster and a spoilt rich kid called Trevor Noseworthy IV.  Warfield Prep was originally a counter intelligence training base, later abandoned and converted into a school. There are still remnants of its former existence in the shape of secret passages and a helicopter-landing pad. The stock pictures, seen from beyond the perimeter wall and gates, makes the building look like a cross between a fortress and a beached naval frigate.  James is consistently interrupted from his studies by the minions of SCUM (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), who number among them familiar villains, like Goldfinger and a slightly extreme version of Jaws, and many new ones, like Dr DeRange, a barmy psychopathic French scientist-turned-villain. The organisation is run by the SCUM Lord, an imposing man in a fedora, face-scarf and purple suit, who rules from afar most of the time and pets his loyal companion Scuzball, a white, snarling pitbull terrier.  The story telling is basic at best, targeted firmly at the under-10s, and the animation is adequate. Stock images, like Warfield Prep, and car chases that lack excitement or energy are common, robbing the series of any chance to impress or excite. The plots are hammered into potential stories by way of school outings, sports trophies and exchange trips, in the way a poorly plotted fantasy novel relies on kick-starting proceedings with a stranger in an inn or a princess-kidnapping dragon. The series also lacks any of the sparkling wit and innuendo of the Bond movies, whether because of the target age group or because the writers genuinely lacked the talent or time to come up with anything better.  The characters are connected to, or converted from, the original Bond concept, with a plentiful sprinkling of individuals who tended to represent a fringe of characters more suited to battling superheroes than secret agents. This may be down to marketing executives believing that adding cybernetic limbs and lasers to anything will make it sell to the kids. Dr No, for example, has become a gaunt, green-skinned character with cybernetic claws for hands, while Jaws has had his entire jaw replaced with a metal mantrap of a mouth and sports a desperate blue suit, red shirt and yellow flower combination.  The characters are painful stereotypes filling out a school that doesn't appear to educate many vocal teenagers. The stories continuously centre around a small group with various villains popping up to cause trouble.  James Bond Jr - Action hero and star of the show, James is a capable driver and spy with a dark brown quiff and an eye for the ladies. He is frequently rescued by gadgets and good fortune rather than actual skill. Corey Burton, who provided James Bond Jr's voice, also, bizarrely, supplied the voices of the Critters from the movie of the same name. Horace Boothroyd - Educated to the point of explosion and grounded firmly in the lore of his grandfather, Q, Horace – better known as IQ – is the thinker and inventor of the group. He is constantly coming up with gadgets and is the character most likely to be left behind at school and out of the thick of the action. Jeff Bennett, who also provides the Elvisesque tones of Johnny Bravo, provided IQ's voice. Tracy Millbanks - The daughter of the headmaster, Tracy is bright, daring and willing to take the lead, presenting a reasonable sparring partner to James and an unrequited target for his affections. Gordo Leiter - A California surfer-dude with long blond hair and a tan. Common sense consistently fails him, while appearance and having a good time are paramount. Phoebe Farragut - The average Scooby-Doo Thelma-clone, she's short, bespectacled, intelligent and infatuated by members of the opposite sex who don't seem to realise she exists, like James. Trevor Noseworthy IV - Haughty, jealous and pathetic, Trevor constantly seeks attention with doubtful talents or looks to undermine the reputations of others, especially James. Mr Millbanks - A firm and uneven tempered gentleman with grey hair and a moustache, who looks like an ex-British Airforce Officer. Mr Mitchell - The physical education teacher, who is an ex-FBI agent. He has worked with James Bond himself and serves as something of a mission officer for James Bond Jr. Dr DeRange - Appropriately deranged French scientific genius and criminal mastermind. The most commonly encountered villain throughout the run of the series.  The cartoon features the most desperate accents any viewer is ever likely to suffer. All of the teenagers are supposed to have English accents except Gordo, who is equipped with a California dude tone and a lack of common sense to match. The English accents vary from the strained efforts that most English actors appear to adopt when appearing in American films, to outright caricatures of high-class backgrounds – in Trevor Noseworthy IV – and high-class education – in IQ. The accents only get worse when the villains arrive, from unconvincing Scandinavian and Germanic accents, that sound more like a clip from an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, to desperate Oriental efforts. The worst recurring accent is definitely for the villain Dr DeRange, who sounds like a poor impression of John Cleese as the French Taunter in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  All 65 episodes of the series are listed below in the order they were shown. Only slightly over a quarter of these episodes are available on video, though the whole series has been shown many times across the globe on various cartoon or children’s channels, generally during the early morning slot.  A common factor among many of the episodes is the desperate attempts at puns in the titles, which have to be read to be believed. Some of the titles are very dubious indeed, such as Dutch Treat, which sounds more like some form of exotic contraceptive or marital aid.  The videos that have been released contain a random selection of episodes rather than attempting to follow the course of the series. For example, 'The Beginning' was released on a tape along with 'Appointment in Macau' and 'A Race with Disaster'.  Without doubt the biggest opportunity for the James Bond Jr phenomenon was riding the wave of popularity in the parent character and giving children the chance to enjoy spies and adventure as well. Action figures and vehicles, picture and storybooks, clothes and bedding, videos and computer games rapidly followed release of the cartoon. Every chance was taken to bleed the licence for every cent it was worth and, for a time, playgrounds across the world were adrift with James Bond Jr merchandise. However, like every fad before and since, interest died and the baton was passed to the next big thing, leaving Bond to dwindle into obscurity and his toys and videos drifting into the bargain bucket."
137,"The provision covers the two districts of Chana and Thepha, which border three southern provinces already under tight restrictions.  The announcement came as police said three people had been killed in the latest violence in the region, including one man who was beheaded.  About 1,000 people have died in the Muslim-majority south since early 2004.  The army instituted martial law for parts of Songkhla after eight fake explosives were found in Thepha and Chana districts, The Nation newspaper reported.  It is the first time this provision, which allows the authorities to arrest suspects and search their properties without a warrant, has been issued in Songkhla.  The three neighbouring provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat are all under emergency law, which is not as punitive.  There was violence in all three of these provinces on Wednesday and Thursday, police said.  A man's severed head was found early on Thursday in Talogapo village, Pattani province.  He has not yet been identified as the police have not found the body, but his head was shaved, leading to reports that he was a Buddhist.  Buddhists have frequently been targeted in the insurgency.  Late on Wednesday, a suspected militant blew himself up in Narathiwat town as he set up a device against an electricity pole - one of a series of blasts which knocked out power to the area, police said.  And also on Wednesday, a Muslim villager was shot dead in Raman district of Yala province while riding a motorcycle.  In addition to the fake devices found in Songkhla, there was also a number of fake bombs found in five districts of Pattani province on Thursday, police said.  Effigies of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra were found near these devices, and on roadsides in Yala province.  Those in Yala had Thai national flags across their bodies and the word ""Satan"" written across their chests."
138,"Justin Welby, the Bishop of Durham, will become Archbishop of Canterbury when Rowan Williams steps down at the end of the year. Here are 10 things about the new archbishop.  1. His father Gavin Welby was a bootlegger and moved in the same circles as the Kennedys for a time, reportedly introducing John F Kennedy to his first mistress. Welby Sr travelled to the US to make money trading whisky during prohibition. Eventually to get around the law, he imported communion wine.  2.The new archbishop's full name is Justin Portal Welby. His mother, Jane Portal, was Winston Churchill's private secretary. Welby's parents divorced when he was very young. His mother later married Charles Williams, and become Baroness Williams of Elvel.  3. He's a French speaker and Francophile, having lived and worked in France. An announcement about his appointment as Bishop of Durham listed his hobbies as most things French (and sailing).  4. He set up a special day for bereaved parents in Coventry Cathedral. There is now an annual service commemorating the lives of children who have died. A book with the names of lost children is always on display in the cathedral - anyone who has lost a child under any circumstances can ask for their child's name to be added to the book.  Bishop Welby's own eldest daughter, Johanna, died when she was just seven months old in a car crash in France in 1983. He has previously said her death brought him and his wife Caroline closer to God. The couple have five other children.  5. As dean of Liverpool Cathedral he controversially allowed John Lennon's Imagine to be played on the cathedral's bells as part of the Futuresonic 09 art project in May 2009 - despite the line ""imagine there is no heaven"".  ""He could see things from a strategic point of view, that it would get a lot of marketing,"" said Cleo Evans, the artist behind the Cathedral Futuresonic project. ""He could see that by using a popular song he could bring more people to his cathedral.""  As dean of Liverpool, he effectively dealt with the day-to-day management of one of England's largest and most deprived cathedrals, embarking on a plan to double congregations within five years.  6. He has a frank Twitter presence, which reveals a dry sense of humour. In a tweet in February of this year, he confessed that he had been ""very sleepy"" during one debate at the General Synod. In reply to a delegate asking him why he had nodded throughout both sides of the debate, he said that he may have given the impression of being the ""bishop of indecision"".  7. He has negotiated with militants in war-torn parts of west Africa and acted as an arbitrator during religious conflicts across the globe with the Coventry Centre for Reconciliation.  ""His life has been put at risk on a number of occasions, he's had to search under the car for bombs before,"" says Reverend Sally Hitchiner, who worked with him at the centre.  The Right Reverend Peter Price, Bishop of Bath and Wells, has said he believes that his experience of conflict negotiation has helped him in an increasingly divided Church.  ""But it's rather more than that, he paints on a bigger canvas than simply the Church. He's somebody who understands conflict,"" he said.  8. He's an Etonian. Like the prime minister, Bishop Welby went to school at the famous elite boys school Eton. He then went on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge - when Lord Rab Butler, the former Conservative deputy prime minister and a relative of Welby, was head of the college.  Since becoming a priest in 1992, most of his work and ministry has been based in urban parishes in London, Coventry and Liverpool.  9. Welby says his time in business - 11 years as an oil executive - had helped him in his later work in the church.  ""Markets don't allow you to hang about and vacillate. And treasury teaches you about teamwork and working collaboratively,"" he told the Association of Corporate Treasurers.  Welby joined Elf Aquitaine after graduating from Cambridge and worked for the company out of Paris. Elf Aquitaine had sites in West Africa and the North Sea. Welby quickly rose through the ranks to become group treasurer, overseeing the finances of the whole company.  He was recently appointed to the parliamentary committee looking into UK banking standards - especially the ethics which led to the recent Libor scandal.  10. He's only been a bishop for a year. He was enthroned as the Bishop of Durham in November 2011. Compared with his predecessor Rowan Williams, who was a bishop for 10 years, including two as Archbishop of Wales, he is considered inexperienced.

139,"Its Astrium division says it will build a space plane capable of carrying fare-paying passengers on a sub-orbital ride more than 100km above the planet.  The vehicle, which will take off from a normal airport, will give the tourists a three-to-five-minute experience of weightlessness at the top of its climb.  Tickets are expected to cost up to 200,000 euros (£135,000), with flights likely to begin in 2012.  ""Astrium is by far the largest space company in Europe, so we are very knowledgeable in all these matters. We believe our concept is extremely safe, extremely comfortable and cost effective,"" he told BBC News.  Two in one  EADS Astrium is the company that builds the Ariane rocket, which lofts most of the world's commercial satellites. Its space jet is a very different concept, however.  The production model will use normal jet engines to take off and climb to 12km. From there, a rocket engine will kick the vehicle straight up, taking it beyond 60km in just 80 seconds. By the time the rocket shuts down, the craft should have sufficient velocity to carry it above 100km - into space.  As the plane then begins to fall back to Earth, the pilot will use small thrusters to control its altitude, guiding the vehicle into the atmosphere from where it will use its jet engines again to return to the airport.  The total journey time will be about one-and-a-half hours.  Astrium says there will be room for four passengers on each mission. Towards the top of the climb, these individuals will be able to float free in the cabin and look through large windows at the planet below.  Astrium is proposing a different technical solution to the one being pursued by airline boss Sir Richard Branson and his Virgin Galactic enterprise.  SpaceShipOne had to be carried to a launch altitude by another vehicle before using rocket propulsion; and on its return from space, glided to its home runway. Astrium says its decision to go with a one-stage concept was driven by safety and economic considerations.  The Australian Marc Newson was employed to design the space plane's interior. He said he had put great emphasis on the seats - which he describes as ""hi-tech hammocks"" - and the windows to maximise the flight experience.  ""The windows are very similar to a civilian jet airliner but they're about 30% bigger; but more importantly, there're 15 windows and only four passengers, so there're are plenty of opportunities to float around the interior of this cabin and take different views of space, the stars, the Moon, and the Earth,"" Mr Newson explained.  ""It will be amazing. You'll actually be outside the Earth's atmosphere; you'll be able to see Earth as a spherical object and everything else around you will be black. There must be millions of people who have dreamt about this since they were little kids,"" he told the BBC.  EADS Astrium says its space jet project is likely to cost a billion euros to develop. It will be looking for financial and industrial partners over the next year. It says that if development work starts in 2008, the first commercial flights could be made in 2012.  ""The development of a new vehicle able to operate in altitudes between aircraft (20km) and below satellites (200km) could well be a precursor for rapid transport, point-to-point vehicles, or quick access to space,"" Astrium said in a statement.  ""Its development will contribute to maintaining and even enhancing European competencies in core technologies for space transportation."""
140,"British Sky Broadcasting is buying the UK broadband and fixed line businesses of Spain's Telefonica.  It will give Sky half a million customers who use the O2 and BE brands for their home phone or broadband.  It will pay an initial £180m to Telefonica, with up to another £20m being paid once the customers have been switched to Sky.  Sky said the transaction would make it the second biggest UK broadband provider.  Telefonica said the deal would allow it to concentrate on providing better mobile services, including rolling out 4G.  Sky has taken on 4.2 million broadband customers since launching the service in 2006.  The deal will allow Sky to leapfrog Virgin Media and close the gap on the number one provider: BT.  If it is cleared by regulators the deal should be completed in April.  ""Sky has been the UK's fastest-growing broadband and telephony provider since we entered the market six years ago,"" said BSkyB chief executive Jeremy Darroch.  ""The acquisition of Telefonica UK's consumer broadband and fixed-line telephony business will help us accelerate this growth."""
141,"Argentina had been trying to win the Davis Cup for the first time David Nalbandian has denied claims that he rowed with team-mates as Argentina lost to Spain in the Davis Cup final. Nalbandian won his team's only point as they crashed 3-1 in Mar del Plata. He and Agustin Calleri lost the crucial doubles tie on Saturday and there were reports that the pair later squared up in the changing room. ""It really hurts the players when people say things that aren't true,"" Nalbandian, 26, told a news conference on Monday. ""I heard it throughout the media. Nobody saw anything. Nobody was in the locker room. Nobody knows what happened, and that's what bothers me. Understand the anguish and unease right now. Things went badly, but the terrible weekend is over    ""That without knowing what happened from the inside, or from outside, wherever it was, and to do harm to all involved. ""And afterwards we have to definitively come out and defend ourselves."" The world number 11, who has a record of 27 wins and nine defeats in the Davis Cup, insisted that rumours he was considering quitting the Argentina team were untrue. ""It bothers me that people have questioned whether I'm continuing with the Davis Cup or not,"" he said. ""For me, representing my country is really an honour. I'm going to continue - like I've done until this point - defending Argentina's flag the best way possible."" Argentina went into the final as favourites on home soil, and with world number one Rafael Nadal missing for Spain through injury. At the end it was too easy for Spain - Argentina only won one single match despite playing at home    Nalbandian was so upset by the doubles loss that he skipped the mandatory news conference after the match and was fined US$5,000 (£3,300). ""Understand the pain of a player not being able to score a point in an important series,"" he said. ""Understand the anguish and unease right now. Things went badly, but the terrible weekend is over."" It was the third time that Argentina had finished runners-up and they have yet to win the tournament, but Nalbandian is optimistic they can take the final step. ""We made it to two finals in three years,"" he said. ""Why aren't we going to continue having the possibility of reaching our goal?"" Meanwhile, Argentina captain Alberto Mancini has quit in the wake of the defeat. ""It's the end of a cycle, and one during which we got to the final twice and the semi-finals once,"" he said. ""I'm satisfied with what I've been able to do.""     "
142,"Radzinski, 33, and midfielder Claus Jensen, 30, who revealed he was leaving on Friday, rejected the chance to extend their deals earlier this season.  Goalkeeper Mark Crossley and Welsh midfielder Mark Pembridge have also been released by the new boss.  On-loan trio Wayne Routledge, Jan Lastuvka and Vincenzo Montella have all returned to their parent clubs.  Canada international Radzinski joined the Cottagers from Everton in 2004 and made over 100 appearances.  He was signed as a forward but has also played in midfield during his time with the club.  Radzinski scored three goals this season, with Premiership strikes against Arsenal and West Ham and another in the 3-0 FA Cup win over Stoke.  Jensen criticised the club last week after claiming he had no future under Sanchez's ""long-ball"" tactics and becomes a free agent.  Crossley, 37, spent part of the season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and has been told he will not be offered a new deal."

The tribute gala will be held a day before the annual awards show.  Shakira, is also up for three Grammys, including album of the year.  The 34-year-old star is the youngest person to receive the tribute. Previous recipients include Placido Domingo, Carlos Santana, Gloria Estefan, Julio Iglesias and Ricky Martin.  In a statement, the singer said receiving the award was ""truly an honour"".  Shakira rose to fame in the early 1990s, but it was not until the release of her 2002 single Whenever, Wherever that she achieved worldwide success.  Her 2009 album She Wolf has sold more than two million copies worldwide and she recorded Fifa's official song for the 2010 World Cup.  Her philanthropic efforts began at the age of 18, when she founded a charity aimed at supporting the academic needs of underprivileged children. She is also a global ambassador for Unicef.

144,"Robert Mugabe has been sworn in for a sixth term Zimbabwe's ambassador to the UN has dismissed calls for sanctions against his country over pre-election violence, in an interview with US media. Pressure is growing on African leaders meeting in Egypt to take a firm line on Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe has claimed victory in a presidential poll that the opposition pulled out of amid widespread violence. Asked about sanctions, Mr Chidyausiku told AP news agency: ""I'm not even bothered, I wouldn't lose sleep over it... We are not a threat to international peace and security."" Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. He added: ""We see the whole approach to sanctions as a weapon to try and effect a regime change in Zimbabwe."" The Zimbabwe crisis has overshadowed the African Union (AU) summit in Sharm el-Sheikh. Sierra Leonean President Ernest Koroma said African leaders should use Tuesday, the final day of the two-day summit, to condemn Mr Mugabe's re-election. Mr Koroma expressed support for a South African initiative to encourage the formation of a transitional government of national unity. We think it is important the African Union signal that a sham inauguration preceded by a sham election does not make the government legitimate    Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga urged the AU to suspend Mr Mugabe until he allows free and fair elections. And Senegal's Foreign Minister, Cheikh Tidiane Gadio, complained of hesitancy among the AU leaders to openly pressure the Zimbabwean president. But Africa's longest serving leader, Gabon President Omar Bongo, said Mr Mugabe should be accepted as the country's elected president. Before the opening meeting at the Red Sea resort, Mr Mugabe hugged several heads of states and diplomats, one African delegate told AP news agency. Correspondents say he is still seen by many Africans as a hero of the anti-colonial struggle. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, said he was pressing for the Security Council to impose sanctions against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's opposition wants neighbouring countries to persuade Robert Mugabe to step down. So how are relations changing? South Africa's leader Thabo Mbeki remains the key mediator. He has not criticised Mr Mugabe, despite pressure from the ruling ANC. Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is one of Robert Mugabe's closest allies. He has urged Mr Mugabe to end the violence. Botswana said Zimbabwe's 27 June run-off vote was so flawed by violence that it could not be considered legitimate. Namibia is an ally of Robert Mugabe. It wants to re-distribute white-owned farms to black villagers. It has not criticised the violence. Mozambique has hosted some white farmers forced out of Zimbabwe when their land was seized. It is seen as sympathetic to the opposition. Tanzania's ruling party has a history of backing Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. Its foreign minister has condemned the violence. DR Congo's President Joseph Kabila is an ally of Robert Mugabe who sent troops to help his father, Laurent Kabila, fight rebels. Malawi is seen as neutral. But 3m people from Malawi are in Zimbabwe and many were badly hit by the farm invasions. The US is expected to present a draft resolution on Wednesday calling for an arms embargo, a travel ban on regime officials and a freeze on the assets of key individuals and companies. US state department spokesman Tom Casey said: ""We think it is important that the African Union signal that a sham inauguration that was preceded by a sham election does not make the government legitimate."" But analysts say it may be difficult to persuade South Africa, Russia, China and others to accept UN sanctions. Criticism from Europe mounted on Monday with France labelling Mr Mugabe's government ""illegitimate,"" and Britain saying the recent election would not be recognised. Italy - which last week urged EU nations to withdraw their ambassadors to Harare - recalled its envoy to Zimbabwe in protest. MDC leader Mr Tsvangirai defeated Mr Mugabe in the presidential vote on 29 March but failed to win an absolute majority. He reluctantly agreed to participate in the 27 June run-off but withdrew blaming violence which he said had killed nearly 90 of his followers. He has been holed up at the Dutch Embassy in Harare since withdrawing from the race. Are you in Zimbabwe? What do you think of the international reaction to the election?

147,"When a fire in the small town of Marl in the west of Germany closed down an obscure chemical plant on 31 March, it barely made headlines.  Two people died and that was a personal tragedy for their families and friends, but the shock waves did not resonate far beyond.  Except, it turns out, to the other side of the Atlantic - in Detroit, Michigan.  So tight is the global car industry's supply chain that one break in a small link threatens the lot.  About three weeks after the fire, executives from the world's biggest auto-makers and their suppliers have met with furrowed brows to take stock of the implications of the fire.  And they are serious.  It turns out that the braking and the fuel systems of cars depend on a resin called PA-12.  And PA-12 is made out of an inelegantly named chemical: cyclododecatriene, or CDT.  Evonik Industries' plant in Germany was responsible for a good chunk of the world's supply - one estimate put it between a quarter and a half.  The supply of PA-12 was already tight because it is also used in solar panels.  In addition, Evonik says that it will take at least three months and perhaps longer before its damaged chemical plant can resume full production.  That has set off alarm bells throughout the car industry.  Earlier this week, more than 200 executives from companies including General Motors, Volkswagen, Toyota and Ford met in Michigan.  Under the auspices of the Automotive Industry Action Group, six technical committees were set up to assess the impact of the shortage and to seek alternatives.  The group said that it was clear that ""a significant portion of the global production capacity"" had been compromised.  After the meeting, the big car companies were saying nothing on the record.  But some sources now say there is a real worry that the potential impact could be serious, including a slow-down in production.  It seems odd to say, but the motor industry is seeking hope from last year's tsunami, earthquake and nuclear disaster, which devastated Japanese industry and highlighted how manufacturers everywhere rely on component suppliers .  At the time, one fear throughout the automotive industry was that there would be a shortage of some colours of paint that were produced by a plant in Japan that was destroyed.  In the end, alternatives were found.  Choices were limited, but sales were not impinged. Necessity was the mother of ingenuity.  But it is not easy to see an easy solution to the damage caused by the fire and explosion at the German plant.  One of the industry's research bodies, IHS Automotive, says alternatives would have to be approved by the authorities, and that is not done easily or quickly.  ""Given the component testing and approval processes employed,"" it says, ""it is unlikely to be the work of a moment to find or develop a substitutable alternative material.""  According to IHS Automotive, the mood at the meeting of car industry executives was ""extremely serious and there was significant concern over the potential for production disruptions in the component industry, with obvious knock-on effects"".  The concerns come as the US car industry starts to pick up after the financial crisis.  On one industry assessment, nearly 60 plants that supplied the automotive industry in North America closed in the three years after 2008, with the loss of about 100,000 jobs.  Sales of cars in North America dropped to their lowest in 30 years in 2009, but are now heading back up.  This means that there was already a worry about whether the suppliers of parts could keep up.  And that was before the fire in Germany threw a real spanner in the works."
148,"What do you get if you combine the world's most famous secret agent with a generous dose of Saved by the Bell ? One reaction might be to suggest TeenAgent, or any number of dubious efforts to present teenage spies. But what if it was a cartoon?  Well, what you get is a series that fills half-an-hour of a child's time and provides some harmless entertainment for any tolerant adult. James Bond Jr offered us the adventures of the famous 007's teenage nephew and gave children the chance to view action and gadgets without worrying about any restrictive film rating.  James Bond Jr, nephew to the well-known secret agent, attends a private school - Warfield Prep School - in the heart of England. The school is attended by a number of other vaguely familiar characters like IQ, grandson of Q, the Bond gadget-master, and Gordo Leiter, surfer-dude son of Bond's occasional CIA contact Felix. The programmes are also padded out with standard stereotypes like a crotchety, but occasionally reasonable, headmaster and a spoilt rich kid called Trevor Noseworthy IV.  Warfield Prep was originally a counter intelligence training base, later abandoned and converted into a school. There are still remnants of its former existence in the shape of secret passages and a helicopter-landing pad. The stock pictures, seen from beyond the perimeter wall and gates, makes the building look like a cross between a fortress and a beached naval frigate.  James is consistently interrupted from his studies by the minions of SCUM (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), who number among them familiar villains, like Goldfinger and a slightly extreme version of Jaws, and many new ones, like Dr DeRange, a barmy psychopathic French scientist-turned-villain. The organisation is run by the SCUM Lord, an imposing man in a fedora, face-scarf and purple suit, who rules from afar most of the time and pets his loyal companion Scuzball, a white, snarling pitbull terrier.  The story telling is basic at best, targeted firmly at the under-10s, and the animation is adequate. Stock images, like Warfield Prep, and car chases that lack excitement or energy are common, robbing the series of any chance to impress or excite. The plots are hammered into potential stories by way of school outings, sports trophies and exchange trips, in the way a poorly plotted fantasy novel relies on kick-starting proceedings with a stranger in an inn or a princess-kidnapping dragon. The series also lacks any of the sparkling wit and innuendo of the Bond movies, whether because of the target age group or because the writers genuinely lacked the talent or time to come up with anything better.  The characters are connected to, or converted from, the original Bond concept, with a plentiful sprinkling of individuals who tended to represent a fringe of characters more suited to battling superheroes than secret agents. This may be down to marketing executives believing that adding cybernetic limbs and lasers to anything will make it sell to the kids. Dr No, for example, has become a gaunt, green-skinned character with cybernetic claws for hands, while Jaws has had his entire jaw replaced with a metal mantrap of a mouth and sports a desperate blue suit, red shirt and yellow flower combination.  The characters are painful stereotypes filling out a school that doesn't appear to educate many vocal teenagers. The stories continuously centre around a small group with various villains popping up to cause trouble.  James Bond Jr - Action hero and star of the show, James is a capable driver and spy with a dark brown quiff and an eye for the ladies. He is frequently rescued by gadgets and good fortune rather than actual skill. Corey Burton, who provided James Bond Jr's voice, also, bizarrely, supplied the voices of the Critters from the movie of the same name. Horace Boothroyd - Educated to the point of explosion and grounded firmly in the lore of his grandfather, Q, Horace – better known as IQ – is the thinker and inventor of the group. He is constantly coming up with gadgets and is the character most likely to be left behind at school and out of the thick of the action. Jeff Bennett, who also provides the Elvisesque tones of Johnny Bravo, provided IQ's voice. Tracy Millbanks - The daughter of the headmaster, Tracy is bright, daring and willing to take the lead, presenting a reasonable sparring partner to James and an unrequited target for his affections. Gordo Leiter - A California surfer-dude with long blond hair and a tan. Common sense consistently fails him, while appearance and having a good time are paramount. Phoebe Farragut - The average Scooby-Doo Thelma-clone, she's short, bespectacled, intelligent and infatuated by members of the opposite sex who don't seem to realise she exists, like James. Trevor Noseworthy IV - Haughty, jealous and pathetic, Trevor constantly seeks attention with doubtful talents or looks to undermine the reputations of others, especially James. Mr Millbanks - A firm and uneven tempered gentleman with grey hair and a moustache, who looks like an ex-British Airforce Officer. Mr Mitchell - The physical education teacher, who is an ex-FBI agent. He has worked with James Bond himself and serves as something of a mission officer for James Bond Jr. Dr DeRange - Appropriately deranged French scientific genius and criminal mastermind. The most commonly encountered villain throughout the run of the series.  The cartoon features the most desperate accents any viewer is ever likely to suffer. All of the teenagers are supposed to have English accents except Gordo, who is equipped with a California dude tone and a lack of common sense to match. The English accents vary from the strained efforts that most English actors appear to adopt when appearing in American films, to outright caricatures of high-class backgrounds – in Trevor Noseworthy IV – and high-class education – in IQ. The accents only get worse when the villains arrive, from unconvincing Scandinavian and Germanic accents, that sound more like a clip from an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, to desperate Oriental efforts. The worst recurring accent is definitely for the villain Dr DeRange, who sounds like a poor impression of John Cleese as the French Taunter in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  All 65 episodes of the series are listed below in the order they were shown. Only slightly over a quarter of these episodes are available on video, though the whole series has been shown many times across the globe on various cartoon or children’s channels, generally during the early morning slot.  A common factor among many of the episodes is the desperate attempts at puns in the titles, which have to be read to be believed. Some of the titles are very dubious indeed, such as Dutch Treat, which sounds more like some form of exotic contraceptive or marital aid.  The videos that have been released contain a random selection of episodes rather than attempting to follow the course of the series. For example, 'The Beginning' was released on a tape along with 'Appointment in Macau' and 'A Race with Disaster'.  Without doubt the biggest opportunity for the James Bond Jr phenomenon was riding the wave of popularity in the parent character and giving children the chance to enjoy spies and adventure as well. Action figures and vehicles, picture and storybooks, clothes and bedding, videos and computer games rapidly followed release of the cartoon. Every chance was taken to bleed the licence for every cent it was worth and, for a time, playgrounds across the world were adrift with James Bond Jr merchandise. However, like every fad before and since, interest died and the baton was passed to the next big thing, leaving Bond to dwindle into obscurity and his toys and videos drifting into the bargain bucket."
149,"He told the High Court his evidence to a Commons sub-committee was not accurate. He apologised but said he had not been trying to conceal any plot.  Mr Byer's words came on the last day in the case of Railtrack shareholders who are claiming compensation.  About 50,000 shareholders claim the government deliberately allowed the rail infrastructure firm to fail in October 2001, and are demanding £157m in compensation.  When Mr Byers was questioned by a Commons sub-committee, he said he was not aware of a change in Railtrack's status being discussed before 25 July 2001.  But in the court on Thursday he was challenged over this version of events by the shareholders' barrister - who produced documentary evidence showing the work had started.  They included e-mails and notes from Department of Transport officials showing that taking Railtrack into administration had been one of the options being discussed as early as June.  Quizzed by Keith Rowley, QC for Railtrack shareholders, Mr Byers admitted his answer to MPs had been untrue.  ""It is true to say there was work going on, so, yes, that was untrue,"" he said.  Questioning Mr Byers again about the ""welter of documentation"" on the options for Railtrack, Mr Rowley, QC said: ""You could not possibly have believed that the answer you gave ... was true, could you?""  ""I accept this is not an accurate statement,"" said Mr Byers.  He was asked if it was ""deliberately not an accurate statement"".  Mr Byers replied: ""It was such a long time ago, I cannot remember, but it is not a truthful statement and I apologise for that.  ""I cannot remember the motives behind it.""  The MP later told the court he had been under pressure during the hearing and had not set out to conceal any conspiracy or plot.  Responding to Mr Byers' admission, shadow transport secretary Alan Duncan said whatever the verdict in court, the government ""will still have to face the verdict of parliament"".  ""I make no judgement about the court case but it seems from all the evidence that is emerging that this is a growing scandal of government from which Stephen Byers and Gordon Brown have no escape.  ""If, as it seems today, Stephen Byers lied to a parliamentary committee, not only is that a disgrace in itself but it shows that their plans for Railtrack were deeply devious and could be a scandal of enormous proportions.  ""Whatever happens in court this issue is not going to go away.""  Mr Byers resigned as transport secretary in May 2002.  At the time, he said he had tried to ""behave honourably"", adding ""the people that know me best know I am not a liar"".  Mr Byers has told the High Court the Treasury had concerns about ending Railtrack and removing the role of shareholders.  He said Chancellor Gordon Brown had a list of 10 conditions to be met before he would agree to Railtrack being changed to a non-shareholder company.  The list was internally nicknamed ""The 10 Commandments"", he said.  At a meeting on 19 September 2001 - three weeks before Railtrack went into administration - Tony Blair told Mr Byers he had to talk to the chancellor if he wanted more money to fund the company.  But the court heard it was left to Mr Byers to decide whether to take the company into administration if he decided to refuse Railtrack's request for more money - subject to the Treasury conditions.  Mr Byers said he had worked with his officials to see if the conditions could be met.  On Thursday, the shareholders QC, Keith Rowley, about when he made up his mind.  ""I suggest there was a clear strategy, developed by you and your officials, accepting that Railtrack would not immediately collapse but might fall over in a year or two, to force Railtrack into administration by ensuring you held all the cards and all other options were closed off,"" said Mr Rowley.  But Mr Byers replied that his discussions with officials were ""sensible contingency planning"" in case it was decided to refuse to give the company more funds.  There is one more witness to be heard in the court case and lawyers for both sides will spend most of next week delivering their closing speeches.  The judgement in the case is not expected to be delivered until after the court's summer break."
150,"By BBC News Online's Ray Dunne It is 20 years since four MPs called a press conference in London to announce their plans to ""break the mould of British politics"". It was an ambitious pledge but within 10 years it would become clear that the Social Democratic Party (SDP) would achieve no such thing. However, the 'gang of four' - Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams - came close and at times it looked like they may succeed. The four left the Labour Party citing major differences over European and defence policies. The party had lost the 1979 general election and was taking a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot. The 'Limehouse declaration' unveiled at the London press conference outlined an alternative vision. Within two months, a party had been formed under the title SDP - the four having apparently toyed with the idea of calling themselves New Labour. In a recent interview, former leader David Owen now Lord Owen said: ""We looked at Radical, New Labour Party, Democratic Labour but we ended up with Social Democratic Party because that was part of the European continental tradition."" He said they had rejected the New Labour name because they wanted the breakaway party to have a wider appeal and attract disillusioned Conservatives as well as Labour members. For a time it did. The party joined forces with the Liberal Party to create the Liberal-SDP Alliance in autumn 1981. This electoral alliance was headed jointly by Liberal leader David Steel and SDP leader Roy Jenkins. By the middle of 1982 the Alliance could boast 30 MPs - nearly all defectors from the Labour benches. Only a single Conservative crossed over although the party did win a handful of by-elections. Early opinion polls suggested that the British electorate supported this bid to ""break the mould"". At one point, the Alliance had in the region of 50% support in the polls. However, by the time of the 1983 the poll ratings had fallen. The Alliance secured more than 25% of the vote - just two points behind Labour - and entered the new parliament with 23 MPs. By the time Margaret Thatcher next decided to go to the country support for the Alliance was still strong. The 1987 general election saw the Alliance this time under the leadership of the ""Two Davids"" - David Steel and David Owen - win 23% of the vote and 22 seats. Labour, with Neil Kinnock at the helm, won 31% of the vote and secured 229 seats. After six years of existance the SDP and the Alliance, it was beginning to look like the mould of British politics would not be broken. After the election, Liberal Party leader David Steel proposed an official merger or what he called at the time a ""democratic fusion"" with the SDP. While most of the SDP's membership voted in favour of the merger, its leader David Owen remained adamantly opposed. He continued to lead a rump with a pledge to fight the now new Social and Liberal Democrat Party (SLD). Initially, his move seemed to be well informed. One year after the merger, the SDP pushed the SLD into third place in the Richmond by-election. But by 1990, everything had gone wrong. The party came seventh out of eight candidates with just 155 votes in the Bootle by-election trailing even the Monster Raving Loony Party. Within days, David Owen had announced the end of the party that was supposed to break the mould of British politics. What went wrong? Many have suggested that personalities got in the way. But according to Lord Owen the problems were down to a reforming Labour Party. Speaking this week, he said: ""I think as the Labour Party started to reform it became inevitable that the SDP would not be able to survive as a separate party."" The former SDP leader recently caused controversy when he suggested that he was the original architect of the policies behind New Labour. Lord Owen, who stood down as an MP in the 1992 election, believes that the reformed Labour Party is one of the lasting legacies of the SDP. Others however would disagree. Some critics have suggested that all the party achieved was a split in the left's vote throughout the 1980s allowing the Tories to remain in power. But he believes that the ""pressure of having a party take away a very substantial proportion of its vote"" forced the Labour Party to modernise. Few in the ranks of New Labour agree. While the gang of four never actually managed to break the mould of British politics, their influence and that of the SDP can still be felt. All four remain in politics, with Jenkins, Williams, and Rodgers sitting in the House of Lords for the Liberal Democrats. Lord Owen is a cross-bencher and is these days concentrating on fighting off attempts to get Britain to sign up to the euro as head of the pressure group New Europe. Many former members of the party are now working in the backrooms for both the Tories and Labour. But most have remained in the Liberal Democrats - not least their leader, one time SDP MP Charles Kennedy."
151,"While Henry Kissinger was wrong to describe Bangladesh as a ""basket case"" in the mid-1970s - it has for the most part been more than capable of feeding itself since independence - there is nevertheless a strong feeling that the country may not escape an equally damaging epithet - that of a ""failed state"".  Bangladesh's latest problems stem from a not unexpected but decisive announcement by the Awami League - and around 18 smaller parties allied to it - that they will boycott general elections due later this month.  Fears are now growing that the future of the country and its 150 million population are now at stake.  After last week's momentous boycott announcement by the Awami League leader, Sheikh Hasina, more violence and social unrest are very much on the cards.  The animosity between her and the leader of the other main party, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), seems to be as great as ever.  The two women are bitter rivals and barely speak to each other. Their mutual loathing is reflected among their respective sets of supporters.  Bangladesh is one of the most politically polarised countries in the world, even though the actual policy differences between the two largest parties do not amount to anything significant.  But the ceaseless bickering and violent confrontations have meant that the Bangladeshi economy - already fragile - is coming under further pressure.  That is bad news when millions in the population barely earn more than $1 a day.  The country is now reeling under a three-day transport blockade called by Sheikh Hasina as part of her campaign to demand a delay in the election and the removal of officials overseeing the vote who she describes as ""biased"".  More than 40 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in political violence since a caretaker government - designated by the constitution to oversee the vote - assumed power at the end of October to steer the country through parliamentary elections.  Ominously, the Awami League-led alliance has not only pledged to boycott the election but has also promised to resist the voting.  If that happens, there will be a campaign of mass protests by the anti-election parties.  In turn, the pro-election parties will try to gain control over the streets - and direct confrontations will be inevitable.  A crucial factor in all this is the role of the law-enforcement agencies - controlled by the caretaker government - and their ability to curb any violence.  Despite the boycott decision, the caretaker government says that it is determined to organise the election on time.  But analysts fear that the result might not be accepted nationally and internationally, and the country would be plunged into anarchy.  The Awami League-led alliance says that conditions for free and fair elections are not in place and the vote should be delayed.  They say that President Iajuddin Ahmed - in charge of the caretaker administration - should step down and an up-to-date voter list be published.  ""There is major legitimate concern about the process leading up to a free and fair election,"" said analyst Debapriya Bhattacharya, the executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue think-tank.  The most-debated issue now is whether there is any ""constitutional flexibility"" which can be invoked in order to allow more time to accommodate the Awami League demands.  But the BNP of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia is not interested in that.  Dr Bhattacharya argues that such a stand-off is going to have a serious impact on the overall development prospects of the country as well as further complicate Bangladesh's ""image crisis"".  ""One possibility is that with rough and tough measures the caretaker government pushes through with the election, which of course eventually will not be credible because so few candidates are participating,"" he said.  The other possibility is that the opposition campaign stimulates so much pressure that the country becomes paralysed, forcing the caretaker government to reconsider the election schedule and carry out electoral reforms before announcing a new vote schedule.  If there is a complete breakdown of law and order, Dr Bhattacharya said that martial law is not beyond the realms of possibility.  ""But whatever may be the options, each party will always look for constitutional cover so that they can somehow have a legitimate basis for their action,"" he said.  Many Bangladeshis are now doubtful about the future of democracy in the country. The BNP has already warned that the Awami League alliance will be responsible if democracy is endangered.  Analysts say the two main parties must come to some kind of agreement if disaster is to be averted.  ""If Bangladesh wants to maintain its development prospects and democratic credentials, it will have to have a credible election held in a free and fair way,"" Dr Bhattacharya said.  For Bangladesh - with 40% of the population living below the poverty line - democracy and development are interlinked, he said.  ""If the country does not improve its governance through better democratic practices, it will not have good development, and without that, it is not going to sustain its democracy.""  Bangladesh's political history has always been turbulent.  Just how turbulent now depends on the Awami league and BNP leaders."
152,"Bleddyn Williams was one of the finest centres Wales has produced Former Wales and British and Irish Lions captain Bleddyn Williams has died at the age of 86. The 'Prince of Centres' made his Wales debut against England in 1947 and won 22 caps, including five as captain, in a Test career that ended in 1955. Williams famously led Wales to a 13-8 win over New Zealand in 1953, having also skippered Cardiff RFC to a win over the tourists a month before. That remains the last victory secured by Wales against the All Blacks. Williams was also vice-captain of the 1950 Lions on their tour of New Zealand and Australia, captaining them in the third and fourth Tests in New Zealand with Karl Mullen injured. Although the tourists could only manage a draw and three defeats against the All Blacks, the Lions beat Australia in both internationals that followed on the other side of the Tasman. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. In total Williams played in 20 of the Lions' 29 matches and scored 13 tries, including one in the first Test win over Australia in Brisbane. Born in Taffs Well on 22 February, 1923, the Williams family became synonymous with Cardiff RFC as eight brothers played for the Welsh capital club. Possessed of a tremendous side-step and great pace, Williams was also a fierce tackler, a great reader of the game and an inspirational leader. That complete package saw Williams earn the nickname 'Prince of Centres'. Despite going on to become a rugby great in midfield, Williams started his senior club career as a fly-half with Cardiff Athletic in 1938-39. The start of the Second World War soon after saw Williams join the Royal Air Force as a pilot, where he flew gliders with distinction. His fledgling rugby career continued throughout the conflict, turning out for both the RAF and a combined Great Britain team. Williams returned home and began to make his name with Cardiff RFC, creating a club record by scoring 41 tries in a single season in a total that eventually topped 185. Bleddyn Williams formed the greatest ever Welsh centre partnership with Jack Matthews (think of a supercharged version of the Brian O'Driscoll and Jamie Roberts partnership)    Many of those tries were claimed in tandem with his great centre partner and friend Dr Jack Matthews, a combination that would be transferred into both Wales and Lions shirts. First capped as a fly-half against England at Cardiff Arms Park in 1947, Williams helped Wales to a share of the Five Nations title that season. The 1949-50 season started as a personal disappointment for Williams, after having been named as Wales captain but then being forced to withdraw because of injury. Instead it was loose forward John Gwilliam who led Wales to Grand Slam glory that season, a feat he repeated in 1951-52. Despite his injury problems in 1950, Williams still received a Lions call and in an interview years later admitted he was surprised to go on the tour. ""It was the first tour since the War and a great honour to be selected in the first place, they hadn't had a Lions side since 1930 so there was a lot of interest,"" Williams said. ""I didn't know I was going to go because I was injured. I never played in a game in 1950 - I missed all four internationals - so it was a great surprise. ""I had to prove my fitness before I went, though. I had to play for Cardiff against Bath on the day that Wales were playing at the Arms Park against France. ""I was only out of plaster the week before I played the game. Can you imagine what my muscles were like? ""I just went through the motions but, thanks to Cliff Morgan, I scored a try in the last few minutes of the game. ""I think the media were fooled by that because they thought 'Williams is fit'. ""There were five weeks aboard ship, though, so I did a lot of exercise and I was alright for the tour. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""I've still got vivid memories, even after all these years. It was a marvellous tour and a great side to play with. It had to be, though, as there were 14 Welshmen on tour!"" But his career's crowning glory was still to come in 1953, when Bob Stuart led New Zealand into British waters. First, on 21 November, before a crowd of 58,000 at the Arms Park, Cardiff triumphed 8-3 against the touring Kiwis, with tries from Sid Judd and Gwyn Rowlands. ""Cardiff were so special at the time because they were the club who set the standards,"" Williams mused later. ""On that day the whole team rose to the occasion and it was an experience that we will never forget."" Then, on 19 December, the All Blacks suffered another defeat, going down 13-8 to a Wales national team led by Williams. Williams retired at the age of 32 in 1955, ending against the same opponents he had started his Test career against eight years before, having won 22 Wales caps and scored seven tries. WRU President Denis Gethin said: ""It's very sad news to hear of the loss of one of the greats of not just Welsh and British but world rugby. ""I was very privileged to watch him play when I was a young boy in what I think was probably his last international which was a real treat. ""He was such a humble man with not an ounce of conceit in his body, but he was a man of great stature. ""I remember Graham Henry coming over to coach Wales and one of the first things he wanted to do when he got here was meet Bleddyn and Jack Matthews. ""Graham's father had met them on the Lions tour of New Zealand in the 1960s and been full of stories about these great people he had had the pleasure of spending time with. ""Bleddyn was also from a great rugby family and he would tell everyone who would listen that his older brother was the better player and that he enjoyed watching him play. ""Something like eight of his family played for Cardiff and his brother Lloyd was a Welsh captain but Bleddyn's attitude was always one of total humility."" After hanging up his boots, Williams began a career in the media and quickly established himself as a respected and authoritative commentator on the game. Williams was honoured with an MBE in the 2005 New Year Honours List at the age of 81. He had suffered from ill health for some time and died at the Holme Tower medical centre in Cardiff on Monday. Williams is survived by a son, two daughters and four grandchildren.     "
153,"The 81-year-old prince has been on a respirator in intensive care in a principality hospital since Tuesday.  He is suffering lung, cardiac and kidney problems, although doctors say the deterioration of the function of the organs has been halted.  Pope John Paul II - also in ill health - sent a blessing offering ""warm wishes"" to the prince on Saturday.  A health statement issued by the palace on Sunday said: ""The state of health of [Prince Rainier] remains worrying.""  It said he was conscious but being sedated, ""which allows him to tolerate absolutely indispensable respiratory assistance"".  The bulletin said the prognosis was ""very reserved"". It had used the words ""extremely reserved"" on Saturday.  The prince's family celebrated a private Mass in the palace chapel on Sunday while citizens prayed for him in services around the country.  Prince Rainier has had heart and respiratory problems for 10 years and has been in and out of hospital in recent months.  Rainier III, who acceded to the small principality's throne in 1949, is one of Europe's longest-reigning monarchs.  He went into hospital on 7 March and had appeared to be getting better, but his health took a turn for the worse at the start of the week.  His three children - Crown Prince Albert, 47, Princess Caroline, 48, and Princess Stephanie, 40 - have been at his bedside.  Prince Rainier made world headlines with his marriage to Hollywood star Grace Kelly in 1956 after meeting her at the Cannes film festival.  His advancing age and ill health have led him to delegate more and more responsibility to his son and heir, Prince Albert."
154,"In their midst, a small group of elderly women sit silently.  They are the survivors of the brutal, Asia-wide system of sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army, which the military government encouraged and helped to operate for 13 years, from 1932 until the end of World War II in 1945.  They were euphemistically called ""comfort women"". But experts like Korean American scholar Edward Chang of the University of California say the network of ""comfort stations"" were actually officially-sanctioned rape camps.  Many of the women were even killed as part of an attempt to cover up the crime.  ""There should be no time limit on prosecuting these crimes against humanity,"" Prof Chang said.  Japan says all potential claims by individuals for sufferings inflicted in the war were closed years ago, by treaties normalising its ties with other Asian countries.  But Kang Kyung-wha, a senior official at South Korea's foreign ministry, has recently urged Japan to come to terms with its ""legal responsibility"" and human rights obligations towards the former comfort women.  Kim Gunja, now aged 80, is too frail to attend the Wednesday demonstrations.  Her story is typical of the tens of thousands - some estimates say 200,000 - women from across Asia whose lives were ruined when they became military sex slaves to the Japanese.  At the age of 17, she was tricked into being abducted by a Korean middle-man who delivered large numbers of young women and girls to his country's then Japanese colonial masters.  She was taken by train to the so-called comfort stations for the Japanese army in Manchuria, north-east China, where she says she was raped by the soldiers many times a day for three years.  ""The soldiers didn't know when they would die, and they were very cruel,"" she said.  She was beaten so badly that she lost her hearing in one ear. After the war she could never marry or get a good job.  She still cannot forgive. And she saves her fiercest hatred for current Japanese leaders.  She wants them to show sincere atonement for Japan's past wrongdoings and to take responsibility by paying official compensation.  Facing up to the past  Japan stands accused of a series of evasions in facing up to the military sex slave issue.  According to Mr Chang, Japan's first admission of involvement only came in 1991, after a wartime document came to light in the foreign ministry about the granting of travel permits for Asian women in areas occupied by the Japanese army.  He says that, since then, the Japanese authorities have continued to hinder the search for detailed evidence about the fate of the former comfort women.  But his own research team's trawl through America's national archives has produced a sheaf of files captured by the US army from the retreating Japanese forces.  They contain photos and other personal details of dozens of young Filipino women - evidence, he says, of the most extensive system of female trafficking the world has ever seen.  Since 1992 Japanese prime ministers have all made formal apologies for the war.  But Shin Heisoo, head of the Korean council supporting the former military sexual slaves, believes these statements are just empty words.  Only legal reparations, she says, will suffice to acknowledge what she sees as war crimes.  In Japan, a recent opinion poll showed that only 13% of the population think further apologies to Asian countries are needed.  It also directly funded medical care for the recipients.  A director of the fund, Yasuaki Onuma, acknowledges the criticism of Japan's slow and limited response.  But he also holds some hard-line South Korean campaigners responsible for the impasse.  Many of the Korean victims, he says, were put under intense social pressures to refuse the Japanese donations, although they sorely needed that support.  It was recently decided that the fund will shut down within two years.  So the poison from past cruelties will be passed on to a new generation of Koreans and Japanese.  Kim Gunja now lives near Seoul in a home for former comfort women supported by the South Korean government. She says she hopes Japan will reveal the truth and offer her official compensation.  ""Otherwise"", she said, ""I will not be able to close my eyes when I die."""
155,"Play was temporarily halted at the Australian Open on Thursday when a bird was killed by a tennis ball.  The bird, believed to be a house martin, came to a grisly end when he instinctively chased a moth across the Rod Laver Arena.  Sadly he flew straight into the path of a powerfully struck forehand by French doubles player Michael Llodra.  The force of the shot killed the bird instantly and he dropped like a stone to the court.  Julien Boutter, who was partnering Arnaud Clement in what was already a tense semi-final against Llodra and Fabrice Santoro, was the first to respond. He threw down his racquet and dashed over to where the bird lay, hoping for a miracle. But he was too late, so he fell to his knees, crossed himself and delivered the last rites. The other players joined in the impromptu funeral until a court official ended the ceremony and ushered the bereaved back to their respective sides of the net. Llodra and Santoro then went on to seal a hard-fought 6-3 3-6 12-10 win to book a place in the final. Afterwards Llodra said: ""I didn't do it deliberately. ""But at least I saved the moth."" It is not the first time a bird has been killed in a sporting arena. The gruesome footage of a bird ""exploding"" in a spring-training game between the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks last year was shown on dinner-time news broadcasts around the world. Arizona's Randy Johnson struck and killed a low-flying dove that had the misfortune of crossing in front of home plate at the same time as the 100mph ball. American golfer Tom Kite was trailing by one stroke on the 71st hole of a tournament in Boston last year when he killed a bird with his tee shot. But probably the most famous was the sparrow killed by a quick delivery by Jehangir Khan, of Cambridge University, to T.N. Pearce, playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club in July 1936. The bird died instantly but his memory lives on because they stuffed him and put him on display in the museum at Lord's."
156,"Thousands of people are reported to have been killed and many others injured in a poison gas attack on a Kurdish city in northern Iraq.  Up to 20 aircraft, said to include Iraqi Migs and Mirages, were seen overhead at around 1100 local time in Halabja.  According to experts, the chemicals dropped by the planes may have included mustard gas, the nerve agents sarin, tabun and VX and possibly cyanide.  The attack on Halabja, which is about 150 miles (241km) north-east of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, is the latest in the Iran-Iraq war and follows its occupation by Iranian forces.  Iraq was said to be keen to avenge the fall of Halabja, which is seen as an important centre for Kurdish resistance in their struggle for autonomy.  The assault came after two days of conventional mortars, artillery and rockets from nearby mountains.  According to pro-Iranian Kurdish commanders in Halabja, there were up to 14 aircraft sorties, with seven to eight planes in each group.  The planes were believed to have concentrated their attacks on the city and all the roads leading out of it.  Eyewitnesses have told of clouds of smoke billowing upward ""white, black and then yellow""', rising as a column about 150 feet (46 metres)in the air.  Most of the wounded, who were taken to hospital in the Iranian capital Tehran, were suffering from mustard gas exposure.  Those who escaped death have developed respiratory or visual problems from the cocktail of chemicals dropped on the city.  According to some reports, up to 75% of the victims were women and children.  The injured survivors seen by reporters showed the classic symptoms of mustard gas poisoning - ugly skin lesions and breathing difficulties.  Some residents survived by covering their faces with damp cloths and taking to the mountains around Halabja.  One resident, Abdul Rahman, 60, an employee at the city's mosque, said: ""I do not know where my children are."""

158,"Alaska Air Group has agreed to buy Virgin America in a $4bn (£2.8bn) deal to create the fifth largest US airline.  It will enable Seattle-based Alaska to expand into lucrative hubs such as San Francisco and Los Angeles.  The two boards ""unanimously approved"" the deal, which will see Alaska acquire Virgin America for $57 (£40) a share.  However, Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson said there was ""sadly nothing [he] could do to stop"" the deal.  It is the first US commercial airline merger since US Airways and American Airlines combined in 2013 to make the world's largest carrier.  Virgin America, which accounts for about 1.5% of US domestic flight capacity, was listed on the US stock market in 2014 as an offshoot of London-based Virgin Group.  In a company blog, Sir Richard said: ""I would be lying if I didn't admit sadness that our wonderful airline is merging with another.  ""Because I'm not American, the US Department of Transportation stipulated I take some of my shares in Virgin America as non-voting shares, reducing my influence over any takeover. So there was sadly nothing I could do to stop it.""  He added that consolidation is a trend that ""cannot be stopped"", with the four largest airlines now controlling more than 80% of the US market.  Alaska and its partner regional airlines, which in total account for about 5% of US domestic flight capacity, serve more than 100 cities in the US, Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico.  If the deal gets approval from US government regulators and Virgin America shareholders, the companies expect to complete the transaction by 1 January 2017.  Brad Tilden, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Air Group, said: ""With our expanded network and strong presence in California, we'll offer customers more attractive flight options for non-stop travel.""  Virgin America shares surged 40% to $54.52 - just below the offer price - in early trading.  Alaska, which was reported to have beaten competition from rival airline Jet Blue for the company, fell 4.7% to $78.15."
159,"As people in South Korea debate the merits of eating dog meat ahead of the football World Cup, dog restaurants in Vietnam are doing well.  Dog is a popular dish in the country, where it is eaten for its protein and also for good luck.  It is particularly popular in the urban areas of the north where increasing incomes have sparked a search for new and more exotic recipes.  At a busy restaurant in Hanoi, a woman weighs and chops up small puppies for her customers.  There are about seven dishes featuring dog meat, and they often include the head, feet and internal organs.  Dog meat has a strong smell and taste. It is heavily spiced and usually served with alcohol.  Diners are mostly men - they believe it will make them more virile. But eating dog is reserved for the second half of the lunar month. Dog meat sellers do good business then, with many customers who believe they will dispel their misfortunes by eating the meat.  The dogs are small with long bodies and short legs, best eaten at about a year old. They come from puppy farms or are collected from the countryside.  It is common to see them in the streets of the capital, crammed into wire cages or cooked and skinned on the backs of motorbikes. They are killed with a blow, boiled to remove the fur and roasted.  People who keep dogs as pets are very cautious of their safety, and if a dog is seen on the street, it is usually an exotic breed being watched by one of the family.  Many people are comfortable with the idea of loving their pet and following what they see as the natural order of eating chicken, pork or dog meat.  While eating dog is permitted, eating cats has been made illegal in an effort to reduce the number of rats and mice.  Cats are usually kept tied up or in cages, partly so that their miaows frighten the rodents and partly, as many believe, to protect them from being stolen for illicit cat restaurants."

Artificial intelligence clearly has not developed in quite the way James Cameron's science-fiction franchise predicted, but how close are we to the technologies he depicted?  Central to the Terminator series is the idea of Skynet, the United States's ""Global Digital Defense Network"", which develops self-awareness and begins a nuclear war.  Western military forces have long relied on networks to distribute information, such as the US Department of Defense's system for sharing top-secret information - the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System.  Yet despite the vast amounts of confidential data stored on such networks, the greatest military disaster to have occurred to date is probably Wikileaks's release of diplomatic cables.  More worrying to would-be members of ""the resistance"" is the rise of augmented systems and unmanned military technology.  The Guardian reported last week that a Ministry of Defence study had warned this technology could be the start of an ""incremental and involuntary journey towards a Terminator-like reality"".  Chris Cole, a campaigner who runs the Drone Wars UK website, said: ""It's a fictional scenario... which we are some distance away from, but it's becoming easier to imagine because of the push towards speed.  ""Military decision makers are saying we are too slow to react and we need to start handing over more decision making to machines.  ""We should not go down this route, just like chemical weapons and biological weapons are regarded as being beyond the pale, we should be saying this about automated systems.""  Of course for fans of the Terminator series, the real point of contention is the date Skynet will implement its attack against humanity.  In the original Terminator film Kyle Reese, played by Michael Biehn, is sent back in time from a post-apocalyptic future and tells how Skynet was installed on 4 August 1997 and gained its deadly self-awareness on 29 August.  This future was, however, altered in the second Terminator film, where the heroes succeed in destroying the research that led to the creation of Skynet.  But, as is conveniently revealed in the subsequent sequels, the apocalyptic future was not prevented but merely postponed.  In the timeline shown in the TV show Sarah Connor Chronicles, we see a young Kyle watch as Skynet finally succeeds in launching missiles on 21 April 2011.  The film's director, James Cameron, told the TMZ website: ""Kyle Reese said in the first film that it was only one possible future - clearly, not the one we're in.  ""Maybe Kyle, Sarah, John and the T-800 changed things enough to steer us away from that possible future.""  He added: ""Now instead of nuclear war we need to worry about global climate change.  ""And the machines taking over? With everybody going through their lives bent over their Blackberrys all day long, you could even argue the machines have already won.""  Mr Cameron's cinematic vision has, thankfully, not been borne out, but could there be a final twist in his tale?  To this day the UK's family of military satellites is still called Skynet - a name first coined in 1969 when the first one was built in the US.  A spokesman for Astrium, the company which builds them, said the name preceded the film and was probably a coincidence.  But he added it was just possible the director could have read something about the UK satellite system and adopted the name."
161,"She had performed the unusual feat of winning re-election, despite the mass unemployment her battle against inflation had seen.  But Thatcher took fewer votes than in 1979. Her landslide was caused by the almost equal split in support between Labour and the SDP-Liberal Alliance.  For Labour the 1983 election had been an unmitigated disaster. The only consolation for leader Michael Foot was that Labour had not lost second place to the strong challenge posed by the Alliance.  But although the Alliance could talk up the seven million votes it received it had actually won very few seats - leaving its dream of a breakthrough just that, a dream.  Margaret Thatcher's first administration got off to a fairly shaky start. Her attempt to take the economy by the scruff of the neck and wage a crusade against inflation saw massive unemployment.  If such voter anger was to continue the Conservatives looked like they would be continuing the by now familiar merry go round of Tory governments followed by Labour.  But luckily for the Conservatives Labour had troubles of its own - in spades. The adoption of the principled and high-minded Michael Foot as leader saw the party shift dramatically to the left in opposition.  Leading members of Labour's pro-European wing felt the party no longer had any place for them and in 1981 more than 20 MPs left Labour as Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers set up the Social Democratic Party.  The SDP quickly got into bed with the Liberals, forming the Alliance. The extent to which the new party captured the public imagination was shown when some polls placed them ahead of not just the Tories but Labour as well.  But their support was to wane with the onset of the Falklands War in 1982.  Thatcher's success in re-taking the Falkland Islands after an invasion by Argentina was a very risky venture, but for the loss of 255 servicemen the islands were re-taken.  This bold, decisive move seemed to have been in step with the times, and the Tories now had a grip on power that would remain unshakeable for years.  When the election date was set for 9 June 1983, the pollsters at least were certain that a Thatcher victory was inevitable.  Perhaps a more interesting fight would be the battle between Labour and the Alliance for second place.  Since going down to Thatcher's first election victory in 1979 Labour had changed leaders and marched firmly to the left.  Leading the party into his first and last election battle Michael Foot fought a poor campaign, lacking in organisation as well as the necessary money, not to mention a series of policies that the voters could not support.  The Alliance, although more measured in its pitch to the voters, also suffered from a lack of funds, and Roy Jenkins, its ""prime minister designate"" fared badly in his role as figurehead.  By contrast the Conservatives under Cecil Parkinson ran a highly professional operation.  Money was not a problem, new computer systems were invested in and new techniques such as direct mail were employed to good effect.  And stiff measures were taken against complacent Tory voters when around 1,000 copies of the Labour manifesto were bought and distributed to supporters to help remind them what a Labour government might entail.  The commanding figure of Margaret Thatcher, fresh from victory in the Falklands War, cast a dominant presence over the 1983 election.  The conflict, from April to June 1982, had succeeded in turning Thatcher's strong personality and resolve into a formidable electoral asset for the Tories.  Although in possession of a sharp mind, Labour leader Michael Foot was seen by few as the best possible choice for prime minister in what was presented as an electoral contest between Foot and Thatcher as much as it was between Tory and Labour.  Foot, a former journalist, was the choice of the party's left and his policies drew little support, even from the former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.  His leadership saw the Labour split that lead to the Alliance's birth.  Roy Jenkins, the former Labour chancellor and home secretary, was initially the key figure of their campaign but as he failed to create an impression with the voters his presence was scaled down, and the Alliance's ratings grew in response.  The Conservative manifesto, Forward - the Challenge of Our Times, showed a party hoping to become more radical during a second term.  Reform of the trade unions' political levy was floated, as was a programme of privatisation that was to include British Telecom, British Airways and British Steel.  And the metropolitan councils, all Labour strongholds, as well as the Greater London Council were to be scrapped.  Labour's left wing programme, rambling and radical in equal measure, was referred to by a member of the shadow cabinet as the ""longest suicide note in history"".  It contained pledges towards unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Community as well as the abolition of the House of Lords.  While the Alliance in its offering - Working Together for Britain - promised to reduce unemployment by up to a million.  It also pledged proportional representation and devolution for Scotland and Wales, and called for compulsory balloting before unions could undertake strike action."
162,"After more than 300 years, the trusty old cheque is about to disappear forever. But will we miss it? The cheque's in the past. Cheques, which date back to the English Civil War, are in rapid decline as a means of payment. The latest nail in the coffin came this week with the announcement that Britain's biggest cheque printing plant is to close. Cheque volumes have already declined by 40% since 1990 and are expected to fall by a similar amount over the next 10 years. Some forecasters even think they will have disappeared by the end of the decade. In a recent survey for the Halifax, a third of people predicted their use of cheques would fall over the next three years. In place of the paper slips there are now a range of payment options that tend to make life easier for us, the consumers, while being cheaper for the banks that run them. There is a love affair with the chequebook which will be hard to end - writing a cheque gives you a feeling of control    Whipping out a debit card at the supermarket checkout saves time over teaming up chequebook and cheque guarantee card. And paying by plastic avoids the irritating spending limits on cheques. The rise of telephone banking and, more recently banking on the internet, have seen account holders become accustomed to transferring money electronically. At the same time, the cheque-writing faithful are being squeezed by the trend for Direct Debit as a means of settling bills. Many companies, such as O2, Vodafone and Telewest, are surcharging customers who prefer to pay by cheque. Undoubtedly, there are advantages to letting go of this antiquated payment method. Recent research found many of us don't have the time to pay in cheques we receive. Apparently, only 14% of people manage to bank a cheque on the day we receive it. Some 900 million cheques a year are waiting to be banked. Ahh, the cheque presentation. Where would charities be without it? Yet not everyone is happy about giving up their cheque book. The Halifax survey revealed more than a third of respondents were against phasing out cheques. Many of us still have a sentimental attachment to our dog-eared chequebooks, says Anne-Marie Kesselman, of Bacs, which oversees electronic payments in Britain. ""There is a love affair with the chequebook which will be hard to end. You can touch it, flick through it. Writing a cheque gives you a feeling of control - you are actually making out a payment instead of just signing a debit card slip."" When it comes to mammon, emotional attachment cannot be underestimated - witness people's strong emotions in the debate about the euro. But paying by cheque also makes financial sense. Unlike a debit card, where the funds are immediately deducted from an account, cheques come with about three days grace - the time they take to clear. The typical consumer writes 2-3 cheques a month but receives only eight a year The average personal cheque is for £153 Small business are still wedded to their chequebooks - just 5% of invoices are paid electronically In the monthly run up to pay day, when finances are frequently tight, it can be a useful loophole to exploit. If those arguments fail to convince, think about the £20 cheque that flutters from the birthday card sent by your far-flung granny or distant aunt. ""It's those sort of personal gestures that people will continue to use cheques for."" says Catherine Wike, of the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company. ""For something like that there is no replacement yet."" Finally, cheques have spawned a language that has yet to extend to electronic banking. The cheque's in the post, blank cheque, cheque book journalism. Whoever heard of a bouncing debit card? Some of your comments so far: I'd hate to give up my cheque book. It's my life-line for the last few days of the month. I know I can write a cheque for shopping on a Wednesday and it won't clear until I've been paid on the Friday.  Kevin Miller, Scotland I have a Finnish colleague who had never seen a cheque book until she came here. When she went home, she mentioned cheques to her dad. He replied that he vaguely remembered his dad using them. In case you're wondering how they get by, it is possible to transfer money to your friend's accounts using the bill payment facility on cash machines or internet banking sites!  Luke, UK The main use I make of cheques is to pay my credit card bills!  John, UK I get paid by cheque, I pay 90% of my bills by cheque - it's so easy to keep control of. They can't get rid of cheques - my financial world will ground to a halt!  Fi, England Small businesses which can't afford credit/debit card fees still rely on cheques - for example the only cheque I write on a regular basis pays for my evening classes as they don't accept cards. Will I have to use cash in future?  Alison R, UK My usage of cheques has increased since I started buying things through Ebay. I am not at all happy with the idea that the cheque will disappear.  Stephanie Marriott , England A lot of small businesses (plumbers for example) aren't geared up to accept electronic payment, and some bigger establishments such as solicitors still want payment by cheque.   Chris, UK I am not given the choice of giving up cheque use - Alliance and Leicester are arrogantly imposing a debit card. Cheques are much better because the spending is recorded in the book making tracking easier as it's not likely to get lost like card counterfoils.  Terry Webb, England When children need to take money to school to pay for trips, photographs, lunches, etc. a cheque is by far the safest way.

163,"A Dr Martens shoe factory in Northamptonshire is to expand to meet increased demand for English-made boots.  The company in Wollaston relaunched its vintage-look boot seven years ago, which has become increasingly popular.  It is now taking on 12 new members of staff and four apprentices.  Factory manager Brian Clayton said: ""We are looking at relocating certain machinery to another location in the village of Wollaston.""  Most of the company's shoes are made in the Far East, but it has found a market for English-made shoes.  ""It is the concept of the traditional made in England tradesman behind the product,"" said Mr Clayton. ""The methods and the ideology behind that is strong.""  Dr Martens is looking for skilled employees and also wants nurture a new generation of shoe makers.  The company said it was finding it difficult to find skilled staff as the industry changes.  Mr Clayton said: ""We have to train youngsters for the next generation of shoemaking, which is vital to the success of this business."""
164,"Up to 400 homes of Welsh brick, put up for Welsh dockers, face demolition.  But much of the original Welsh character has long-disappeared and the area is probably more well known as the early childhood home of Ringo Starr.  Regeneration plans are well-supported, but others argue a part of the city's Welsh heritage will be gone for ever if the bulldozers move in.  The Victorian terraced rows ranged off Toxteth's High Park Street have typical Welsh names like Kinmel and Voelas and were once home to migrants mainly from north Wales who went there in search of work.  There is a Madryn Street too, where former Beatles drummer Ringo spent his early childhood before moving over the road near the Admiral pub, which featured on his first solo album cover.  Around 80 houses put forward for regeneration are boarded up, at least one has been bulldozed long ago and a tin bath lies among the rubble it has left behind.  Some houses, built as early as 1881, still do not have an indoor toilet and are failing to meet government standards.  But, apart from the names, there does not seem much 'Welshness' in this corner of Liverpool.  Mary Huxham, 67, is a member of the Welsh Streets Steering Group, which has waged a four-year campaign to persuade residents to opt for regeneration.  The single mother-of-four has lived in Powis Street all her life. She says she still remembers Mrs Davies who used to sell Welsh cakes in a small shop over the road.  ""But there's nothing Welsh about it all now,"" said Mrs Huxham, who also remembers a young Ringo Starr living round the corner.  ""All this Welsh thing has been built up as a myth to try to keep the homes. But look at them now, there's not much of a Welsh welcome here now"".  The government body New Heartlands is behind the regeneration of this area and many other parts of Merseyside.  Chair John Glester said its proposals were based on ""detailed plans and extensive consultation with local residents"".  ""Their views matter most and in the Welsh streets we have the support of 72% of local people.""  Irene Milson chairs the Windermere Dovetail and Camelot residents' group and also keeps up the Beatles connection - the late George Harrison was her cousin.  She lives across the road from the homes chosen for demolition and has fought hard to persuade locals to accept the offer of full market price and incentives.  ""People are still going to be living in the community, people are still being rehoused in the same area, but in better homes.  ""We have worked with the developers and negotiated for what we want.""  She said the familiar Welsh street names could also be retained and become a feature of the new development.  ""The Welshness of the area can be retained by putting up the street signs as a feature of the pocket park there. So hopefully the history of the area will not disappear.""  But others are not so sure. There is a Welsh Streets Home Group fighting the regeneration scheme and trying to find a compromise.  And Reverend Dr D Ben Rees, one of the leaders of the Liverpool Welsh Society, said it was important that the Welsh streets in Toxteth, and others in areas like Anfield and Vauxhall were retained.  He said two thirds of the city had been built by the Welsh. However, over the years the Welsh-speaking community ""with more money in their pockets"" had moved from the ""close-knit"" inner city areas to more affluent areas like Penny Lane and Allerton.  ""One can understand that people do like improvements in their housing, but I don't know that they should do away with 20,000 houses in Liverpool,"" Revd Dr Rees said.  ""Perhaps they can do it somewhere else and leave the Welsh streets alone,  ""We still want these houses to remain as a reminder of the tremendous influence of Welsh builders in Liverpool."""
165,"England coach Clive Woodward could barely contain his anger at the tactics employed by South Africa in Saturday's Test at Twickenham.  The hosts crushed their opponents 53-3 but sustained a number of injuries in the process and Woodward feels his players were deliberately taken out.  Jonny Wilkinson in particular was given a rough ride and it was a late challenge on him which saw Jannes Labuschagne dismissed in the 23rd minute.  He later left Twickenham with his arm in a sling but said: ""I have had some x-rays and they don't show any breaks.  ""But I am not going to know for another 24 or 48 hours what I have actually done. It's pretty painful.""  Woodward said: ""People have got to look at what went on off the ball. Jonny went off injured, but he was being targeted.  ""It was a brutal Test match, if we are honest. I commend referee Paddy O'Brien for the way he handled it, and I commend the England players for their discipline.  ""Everyone who was taken off went off because of injuries. I was just glad that we had one of the top referees in charge, and he kept the lid on it.""  England players were repeatedly taken out off the ball, especially in tackle situations.  As well as Wilkinson, flanker Lewis Moody and scrum-half Matt Dawson went off injured, taking some of the gloss off a 7-try England victory.  Woodward paid tribute to his players as they kept their composure to inflict South Africa's worst-ever international defeat.  ""There was a lot going on out there, and our self-control was magnificent. All the key guys in the team kept their control when they could have lost it,"" he said.  He added that ""there was too much going on that wasn't acceptable"" but feels there is ""not much point"" citing anyone."
166,"The latest addition to the portfolio of laws designed to cut the amount of rubbish we bury in the ground has finally come into force in the UK. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires at least 4kg of e-waste (eg PCs, TVs, washing machines) to be recycled per person. Good news for the environment, but past experience shows that the transition from policy to practice is not always seamless. Remember the fridge mountains? The EU directive to cut the emission of ozone-depleting substances was introduced in 2002, when the UK did not have the facilities to safely remove CFCs from fridges. While the infrastructure was hurriedly put into place, the pile of fridges grew higher and higher. WEEE is the fastest growing stream of waste in the European Union. The UK is estimated to produce 1.2 million tonnes of e-waste each year, which until now had mostly ended up in landfill sites. So are we likely to see a new mountain range of PCs and TVs swamp overstretched recycling facilities? Unlikely, says Myles Pilkington, communications manager for the Sims Group, the world's largest materials recovery firm. The directive has been up and running in most European nations for almost two years, where specialised e-waste recycling facilities have been developed. One of Europe's largest plants is located in Eindhoven, the home town of Dutch electronics giant Philips. With a capacity to process 100,000 tons of e-waste a year, the facility is the blueprint of Sims' ""super WEEE plant"", which it is about to build in Newport, South Wales. It is an industrial-scale operation that receives WEEE from all over Europe. Huge tractors shift the materials around hangar-sized sheds, whether it is computer casing, circuit boards, servers or components. ""The advantage of mechanical dismantling over hand dismantling is the classic reason - you are able to handle larger volumes in a safer way,"" Mr Pilkington explained. ""Arguably, you can get better purity of separated materials by hand sorting, but that is far outweighed by the cost saving you get through mechanical processing. ""We are hoping that technological advances mean that we will be able to get exactly the same results soon."" The firm's history of material recovery stretches back a century, making its name and its money in scrap metal. But the hard hats and steel toe-capped boots belie the hi-tech processes behind the massive machinery munching its way through thousands of tonnes of waste. One of the things that really hit us as a result of the WEEE Directive was the need to recover plastics    The group's Recycling Solutions division, which looks after its e-waste business, also has responsibility for the research and development strategy. And e-waste has presented a whole new challenge - plastics. ""One of the things that really hit us as a result of the WEEE Directive was the need to recover plastics,"" recalled Mr Pilkington. ""Plastics recycling is a new and increasingly important part of our operation,"" he explained. ""We had never had to think about it before, and suddenly it has become the significant volume of the materials we process."" When the company audited the flow of materials through the Eindhoven plant's gates, it found many devices, such as household appliances, were made mainly out of plastic. If the company was going to make a success out of processing e-waste, he said, it had to develop ways that could identify and separate the various plastics found in devices. ""The challenge was how we were going to recover these plastics because they were not compatible with each other. Mr Pilkington was a little coy when asked about the solution Sims had developed, fearing that he would give too much away to competitors. He revealed: ""We are actually going to have two very different technologies working alongside each other to achieve the degree of separation we want."" One of the technologies was ""density separation"", which involves passing granulated plastic through different liquids, causing some plastics to float and others to sink. And the other technology? ""It uses sensors to understand the material and an air-gun to blast the plastics in different directions."" While processing plastics is important as far as fulfilling the WEEE Directive is concerned, it is classified as ""low grade"" material. In other words, the resale value of the recovered material is unlikely to cover the processing costs. ""High-grade materials are predominately metal,"" Mr Pilkington explained. ""Whether in the frame or within the electronics, there are potentially a lot of high value precious metals."" Like the plastics, the metal recovery process involves breaking the components down to the size of thumbnails, after any hazardous parts have been removed manually. 8: Cobalt in steel for structure and magnetivity ""Then there are sorting processes to get the [metals] into their individual constituents,"" he added. These include using powerful ""true magnets"" to extract ferrous metals, and eddy currents (a rapidly alternating electrical current) to attract the remaining non-ferrous metals like copper wiring. The Eindhoven plant also has facilities to recover printer cartridges and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) from TVs and monitors. Across Europe, Sims processed 320,000 tonnes of WEEE in 2006. Two-thirds of this, equivalent to 12.7 million PCs, was handled by ""dedicated processes"" like the ones at its plant in Eindhoven. But this is only a small fraction of Europe's estimated annual e-waste of 6.4 million tonnes, admits Mr Pilkington. ""The entire electronic recycling sector within Europe is estimated to be eventually worth six billion euros (£4.1bn), so there is still a long way to go.""     "

168,"Christians argue both for and against the death penalty using secular arguments (see Ethics: Capital punishment), but like other religious people they often make an additional case based on the tenets of their faith. For much of history, the Christian Churches accepted that capital punishment was a necessary part of the mechanisms of society. Pope Innocent III, for example, put forward the proposition: ""The secular power can, without mortal sin, exercise judgment of blood, provided that it punishes with justice, not out of hatred, with prudence, not precipitation."" The Roman Catechism, issued in 1566, stated that the power of life and death had been entrusted by God to the civil authorities. The use of this power did not embody the act of murder, but rather a supreme obedience to God's commandments. In the high Middle Ages and later, the Holy See authorized that heretics be turned over to the secular authorities for execution. The law of Vatican City from 1929 to 1969 included the death penalty for anyone who tried to assassinate the Pope. Research done in the 1990s in the USA found that Protestants (who interpret the Bible to be the literal word of God) were more likely to be in favour of the death penalty than members of other religious factions and denominations.  In favour of the death penalty It's in the Bible Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed The death penalty is consistent with Old Testament Biblical teaching, and suggests that God created the death penalty. In total, the Old Testament specifies 36 capital offences including crimes such as idolatry, magic and blasphemy, as well as murder. But many Christians don't think that is a convincing argument - they say that there are 35 capital offences, in addition to murder, described in the Old Testament. As these are no longer capital offences, Christians say it is inconsistent to preserve murder alone as a capital crime. The New Testament embodies what must be the most famous execution in history, that of Jesus on the cross. But paradoxically, although the tone of the whole of the New Testament is one of forgiveness, it seems to take the right of the state to execute offenders for granted. In Matthew 7:2 we read ""Whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you"", though this is unspecific as to whether it is God who is doing the dealing, or the state. In Matthew 15:4 Jesus says ""He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die"". Despite the fact that Jesus himself refrains from using violence, he at no point denies the state's authority to exact capital punishment. At the moment that Pilate has to decide whether or not to crucify Jesus, Jesus tells him that the power to make this decision has been given to him by God. (John 19:11). Paul has an apparent reference to the death penalty, when he writes that the magistrate who holds authority ""does not bear the sword in vain; for he is the servant of God to execute His wrath on the wrongdoer"" (Romans 13:4). Capital punishment affirms the commandment that 'thou shalt not kill' by affirming the seriousness of the crime of murder. This argument is based on interpreting the commandment as meaning ""thou shalt not murder"", but some Christians argue that the 'Thou shalt not kill' commandment is an absolute prohibition on killing. Christians who support the death penalty often do so on the ground that the state acts not on its own authority but as the agent of God, who does have legal power over life and death. This argument is well expressed by St Augustine, who wrote: The same divine law which forbids the killing of a human being allows certain exceptions, as when God authorises killing by a general law or when He gives an explicit commission to an individual for a limited time. Since the agent of authority is but a sword in the hand, and is not responsible for the killing, it is in no way contrary to the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill' to wage war at God's bidding, or for the representatives of the State's authority to put criminals to death, according to law or the rule of rational justice. This argument is that the criminal, by choosing to commit a particular crime has also chosen to surrender his life to the state if caught. Even when there is question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual's right to life. In this case it is reserved to the public power to deprive the condemned person of the enjoyment of life in expiation of his crime when, by his crime, he has already dispossessed himself of his right to life.  Only God should create and destroy life This argument is used to oppose abortion and euthanasia as well. Many Christians believe that God commanded ""Thou shalt not kill"" (Exodus 21:13), and that this is a clear instruction with no exceptions. St. Augustine didn't agree, and wrote in The City of God: The same divine law which forbids the killing of a human being allows certain exceptions, as when God authorizes killing by a general law or when He gives an explicit commission to an individual for a limited time. Since the agent of authority is but a sword in the hand, and is not responsible for the killing, it is in no way contrary to the commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"" to wage war at God's bidding, or for the representatives of the State's authority to put criminals to death, according to law or the rule of rational justice. But a modern Franciscan writer says there should be no exceptions to ""thou shalt not kill"". In light of the word of God, and thus of faith, life--all human life--is sacred and untouchable. No matter how heinous the crimes ... [the criminal] does not lose his fundamental right to life, for it is primordial, inviolable, and inalienable, and thus comes under the power of no one whatsoever. The Bible speaks in favour of the death penalty for murder. But it also prescribes it for 35 other crimes that we no longer regard as deserving the death penalty. In order to be consistent, humanity should remove the death penalty for murder. Secondly, modern society has alternative punishments available which were not used in Biblical times, and these make the death penalty unnecessary. Christianity is based on forgiveness and compassion Capital punishment is incompatible with a teaching that emphasises forgiveness and compassion. Capital punishment is biased against the poor Some Christians argue that in many countries the imposition of the death penalty is biased against the poor. Since Christian teaching is to support the poor, Christians should not support the death penalty. Abolition is in line with support for life Capital punishment is inconsistent with the general Christian stand that life should always be supported. This stand is most often taught in issues such as abortion and euthanasia, but consistency requires Christians to apply it across the board."
169,"A 33-year-old man has died from head injuries after a bloody battle broke out between police and demonstrators in Southall. The fighting began when thousands of protesters gathered to demonstrate against a National Front campaign meeting. The extreme right-wing organisation had chosen Southall Town Hall to hold its St George's Day election meeting. The area has one of the country's biggest Asian communities. It was a case of the boot going in - there was no attempt to arrest anybody<br> Police had sealed off the area, and anti-racism demonstrators trying to make their way to the town hall were blocked. In the confrontation that followed, more than 40 people, including 21 police, were injured, and 300 were arrested. Bricks and bottles were hurled at police, who described the rioting as the most violent they have handled in London. Among the demonstrators was Blair Peach, a New Zealand-born member of the Anti-Nazi League. A teacher for special needs children in east London, he was a committed anti-racism activist. During an incident in a side street 100 yards from the town hall, he was seriously injured and collapsed, blood running down his face from serious head injuries. He died later in hospital. Witnesses said his injuries were caused by police baton blows. Martin Gerrald, one of the protestors, was nearby Mr Peach at the time. ""Mr Peach was hit twice in the head with police truncheons and left unconscious,"" he said. ""The police were wielding truncheons and riot shields. It was a case of the boot just going in - there was no attempt to arrest anybody."" Another witness, 24-year-old Parminder Atwal, took the injured teacher into his house and called an ambulance. He said, ""I saw a policeman hit a man on the head as he sat on the pavement. The man tried to get up, fell back and then reeled across the road to my house."" The Anti-Nazi League claim Mr Peach bore the brunt of a ""brutal"" and ""excessively violent"" police baton charge. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said it was impossible to comment on the death until a full-scale inquiry had been completed.    No police officer has ever been charged with the alleged attack on Blair Peach, although 11 eyewitnesses reported seeing him struck by police.    An internal Metropolitan Police inquiry began on the day after his death, headed by Commander John Cass, but was not made public at the time. <br> The inquest recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. The verdict was greeted with dismay, and 79 MPs called for a public inquiry into the case. The request was turned down. <br> The Peach family gained access to parts of the Cass report in 1986. It named six officers, and in 1989 the Metropolitan Police reached an out-of-court settlement with Mr Peach's brother. <br> Celia Stubbs, Mr Peach's partner at the time of the Southall riots, continued to campaign for a public investigation into his death. <br> In April 2010, the police finally released details of the Cass report. Although names of the officers involved were not revealed, it did confirm that an officer probably struck the fatal blow which killed Mr Peach. <br> It also confirmed that no officers would face prosecution following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. <br>"
170,"Millwall Football Club said it ""will fight like Lions"" after Lewisham Council voted to sell land surrounding its stadium to property developers.  The New Bermondsey development will see the creation of 2,400 homes, community facilities and a new overground station around The Den.  Chairman John Berylson said the club had its own building plans and is ""not going to give in"".  The cabinet was recommended to back the decision.  About 80 businesses, including Millwall, are based in the area where the scheme is planned.  The New Den stadium will not be altered but other land used by the club, including a car park and the Millwall Community Trust, would be taken over by developers.  The club had put forward its own proposals for the land, which it said would ""protect the long-term future of this club"".  Millwall's chairman said the decision was ""akin to dropping two divisions"" and accused Renewal of ""point black refusing to work with us"".  ""This will now be a long process before our land can be taken. And it can still be stopped,"" Mr Berylson said.  Artist Willow Winston, who will lose her workshop under the current plans, said that while she welcomed the regeneration, the developers ""wish to destroy everything here"".  ""You can't just wash out the history of an area and the people who live in the area"", she said.  Jordana Malik, director at Renewal, called the vote ""an important step forward"" for New Bermondsey which will lead to the creation of 2,000 jobs.  She said the company would ""strive to continue discussions with the remaining land owners,"" including Millwall.  ""Renewal's vision from the outset was to incorporate a successful, self-sustaining football club at the heart of the proposed development,"" she said."
171,"A huntsman has been fined £500 after he admitted illegally hunting a fox with dogs, a crime that was caught on camera by an animal welfare group.  Hounds from the Seavington Hunt were filmed in January 2013 pursuing a fox in the area around Causeway Lane, Winsham in Dorset.  It was recorded by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).  The footage was used in the case brought by the RSPCA - it cost the charity a total of £4,783 to bring the case to court.  Hunting foxes with dogs has been illegal since 2005 but they can chase a scent and flush out foxes to be shot.  RSPCA inspector Jo Daniel said: ""The footage, provided by IFAW, clearly shows the members of the hunting party searching the area, along with the hounds, before the fox fled and the huntsman pursued it.  ""We cannot stand by whilst laws which are there to protect wild animals are broken and, if sufficient evidence is provided to us, we have an obligation to act to prevent further such offences from occurring.""  Robbie Marsland, IFAW's UK director, said the group's monitors would ""remain vigilant in case anyone else thinks they are above the law"".  Parker, who was ordered to pay £500 in costs, pleaded guilty to a charge of hunting a fox with dogs contrary to Section 1 of the Hunting Act 2004.  The fox does not have to have been killed or maimed for an offence to have been committed."
172,"The days when, if you felt really strongly about something, you could make your point by collecting a few signatures on a petition seem to be over. These days it takes something extra to get your protest noticed. Forget David Blaine. The man currently causing traffic headaches at Tower Bridge as motorists slow down to get a good look is David Chick, a 36-year-old from Sussex dressed as Spiderman, who has come down from a crane where he had been protesting in favour of fathers' rights. His protest follows that of his fellow campaigners, who staged a rooftop demo at the Royal Courts of Justice dressed as Batman and Robin. Police anger with Mr Chick, who climbed to his vantage point on Friday, came to a head on Tuesday when the deputy chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority, Richard Barnes, said the extra policing cost of the protest was £10,000 a day. ""I would like [David Chick] to receive a bill afterwards. If we can charge David Blaine, let us charge him as well,"" he said. David Chick, on his way up the crane at Tower Bridge London mayor Ken Livingstone, a man with more than an eye for a bit of effective publicity, is not impressed, saying: ""He is causing a huge inconvenience to Londoners and is not necessarily the role model one wants for one's children as they grow up - particularly since he also dresses in funny clothes."" But in his choice of dress, at least, Mr Chick has done something right, for it has given the media an easy way of identifying him, and a good photograph to use. His case has thus featured widely in the national papers and on television. After months of Mr Chick and his fellow campaigners trying to get their issue on the political agenda, it may now get there. Getting media attention is the key to many modern protests, and much like performing charity stunts, the more original the protest the better. One Kent hotelier is reportedly going to take advantage of Guy Fawkes' Night to set light to a Jaguar he bought for £2,400, to make his protest against the government. The car used to belong to the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. He and Mr Chick are by no means alone. The creativity shown by demonstrators is illustrated by just some of these tales of modern protest. Milking it   Animal welfare activist Sean Gifford has travelled the length of the UK dressed as a cow to draw attention to the claimed hazards of drinking milk. But the stunt turned sour last year in Aberdeen when angry schoolchildren pelted him with cartons of milk. Mr Gifford and a colleague, also in a cow outfit, were surrounded by about 100 children shouting ""milk for the masses"" and waving banners. The police eventually rescued the two milk-drenched activists, from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and escorted them back to their car. Undaunted by the hostile reception, Mr Gifford said: ""I think they just got a bit over-excited. I'm sure they will go home and think about our message."" But one 16-year-old pupil, quoted by The Scotsman, said: ""This is a stupid idea. I certainly won't stop drinking milk just because a man has dressed up as a cow outside my school."" Chutes away    Professional stuntman Gary Connery parachuted 150ft off Nelson's Column to highlight the political situation in Tibet. Although Mr Connery believed in what campaign group Act for Tibet was doing, he said he wanted to do the stunt because ""it's not every day you're asked to jump off Nelson's Column"". The biggest problem he faced - after an hour long climb up the landmark with four other protesters - was where to land. ""In the end I decided to jump off the column and see what happened. I was prepared to take a knock but it worked out okay,"" he said. The remaining protesters unfurled a photo of the Dalai Lama - the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people - before abseiling down. Mr Connery - whose previous stunts include jumping off the Eiffel Tower and riding a BMX bike off Beachy Head - was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, but later released without charge. The inactivist    In the mid -1990s, Brian Dean quit his highly paid but tedious job in computers in protest, he claims, at wage slavery. Since then, the self-styled ""inactivist"" has spread the anti-work message through articles in The Idler magazine and his own Anxiety Culture website. When he can be bothered, of course. The Anxiety Culture website contains subversive stickers to place around the workplace and articles on ""how to avoid responsibility"" and ""your duty to phone in sick"". ""Politicians see jobs as a cure-all for social ills,"" he says. ""We'd like to see this notion discredited. We'd like to see leisure replace employment as achievable political goal."" One of his other causes is his belief that crime statistics are ramped up by the authorities and media to spread anxiety throughout the population. Rev-erend father    Cornelius ""Neil"" Horan has said he has no regrets after one of the most bizarre - and dangerous - stunts of recent years. The former Catholic priest was jailed for two months after running on to the track during this year's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. He stepped on to the fastest part of the course, where the cars reach 200mph, wearing a kilt and waving a placard saying ""Read the Bible"" and ""The Bible is Always Right"". Several cars had to swerve to avoid him. Mr Horan pleaded guilty to a single charge of aggravated trespass. The 56-year-old said he had not planned to carry out the protest, but he had seen an open gate leading to the track and thought it was a sign from God. The prosecution pointed out that he had arrived at the track with a placard and a change of clothing. The naked rambler   Stephen Gough, aka the Naked Rambler, has been arrested time and again on his trek from Land's End to John O'Groats. His epic walk is a protest against society's attitude to public nudity - and it is just such attitudes which have landed him in trouble with the authorities. This summer, North Yorkshire police reported five sightings of an ""athletic man with an all-over tan"" traversing the Pennine Way, prompting much speculation about the booming popularity of ""boots-only"" walking. But one man, Mr Gough, admits all five were him. ""I'm doing the walk as a celebration of myself as a human being, and my body is an important part of that,"" he has said. It is a drawn-out celebration - Mr Gough is on trial on Friday in Scotland, charged with walking naked in the presence of the public in circumstances likely to produce a road safety hazard and a breach of the peace. Altogether now   The power of massed nudity is something different altogether. Inspired by the women who held a nude vigil against corporate exploitation outside the Nigerian parliament last year, naked protests against war in Iraq were held across the globe in early 2003. In California and in Australia, naked women spelt out ""No War""; in near-freezing temperatures in a Sussex field, the group Bare Witness formed the word ""Peace"". Organiser Mike Grenville said: ""We were all a little bit coy about stripping off, but this is the biggest global crisis since the cold war, so we got over our feelings of embarrassment."" The group now plans to spell out an anti-GM message in central London during US President George Bush's upcoming visit. The nut stunt  An artist protesting against student debt used his nose to push a monkey nut for seven miles to the door of Downing St in September. It took Mark McGowan a fortnight to complete the journey, at the end of which he delivered the nut and a letter, which asked Prime Minister Tony Blair to accept the nut as payment for his student debt. He was not, however, optimistic. ""I'm not really holding out much hope they'll give me £15,000 for doing it,"" he told reporters. It was not the first time Mr McGowan got up close and personal with the capital's mean - and grubby - streets. Last December he rolled four-and-a-half miles across the central city singing ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" to promote kindness to office cleaners.        "
173,"Detectives investigating the murder of a five-year-old boy, whose severed torso was found in the River Thames, are meeting experts on ritualistic killings in South Africa.  They hope officers from the world's only Occult Crimes Unit will be able to help them identify the child and his killers.  Scotland Yard believes the killing could be Britain's first ""muti"" murder and a South African pathologist who carried out a post mortem said he found all the hallmarks of a ritualistic killing.  Commander Andy Baker and Detective Inspector Will O'Reilly will also brief Nelson Mandela about the murder, before the former South African leader makes a public appeal for information on Friday. The torso of the boy, who has been named 'Adam' by officers, was discovered near Tower Bridge in September of last year. During their trip the detectives will also meet academics, doctors and spiritualists in the hope of shedding new light on the investigation. Although the crime is unknown in Britain, South African police deal with a number of ritualistic murders every year. Scotland Yard also hopes ground-breaking forensic work will paint a biological picture of Adam, and reveal a specific country or region where he grew up. It believes Mr Mandela's intervention in the case could lead to new information. Commander Baker said: ""Mr Mandela is a highly respected, valued and revered man by people across the world and in particular by the African community. ""Scotland Yard is deeply grateful he has agreed to help with this inquiry, and we hope that his valuable contribution will encourage those with information to come forward."" Since the boy's body was discovered officers have been unable to find out who he is, despite extensive inquiries and the offer of a £50,000 reward. Adam, who is black, was found in just a pair of orange shorts. No-one fitting the boy's description has been reported missing in the UK or Europe. Police believe he was killed in London but that he originally came from Africa. They say the possibility he was killed by paedophiles is looking increasingly remote."
174,"Wayne Rooney inspired Manchester United as they broke Watford's brave challenge to reach the FA Cup final at Wembley.  Rooney powered home a brilliant 20-yard drive after only six minutes, but Watford levelled with Hameur Bouazza's 26th minute overhead kick.  Cristiano Ronaldo bundled in Rooney's cross two minutes later as United swiftly restored their lead.  Rooney's close-range finish wrapped up the win after 66 minutes and substitute Kieran Richardson chipped in a fourth.  The scoreline looks comprehensive, but Watford were well in contention until Rooney's crucial second and United's third.  The only low point for United was a first-half injury to Rio Ferdinand, who limped off with a groin problem.  United resisted the temptation to rest their stars after the spectacular Champions League win against Roma - and the move paid dividends as Rooney struck brilliantly after only six minutes.  Alan Smith dummied Michael Carrick's pass, and Rooney's first touch was instant before he lashed a rising 20-yard drive past Richard Lee.  United threatened to run away with the semi-final in the early stages, but Watford held on and were rewarded with a stunning equaliser after 26 minutes.  Edwin van der Sar had just received lengthy treatment for a nose injury, and he was still recovering when Tommy Smith headed into the path of Bouazza, who sent an overhead kick into the top corner via a deflection off Gabriel Heinze.  But Watford's celebrations were short-lived as United regained the lead two minutes later.  Rooney was the creator, racing clear and crossing for Ronaldo to bundle in from six yards.  United suffered a blow six minutes before half-time, when Ferdinand was forced off with a groin injury and was replaced by Darren Fletcher.  Watford keeper Lee then kept his side in the game with a fine one-handed save from Rooney after a slick exchange with Ryan Giggs.  Fletcher then headed inches wide as United ended the first half in the ascendancy.  Watford, backed by thousands of fans bedecked in yellow, started the second period with real vigour, and Bouazza turned a close-range effort agonisingly wide as the Hornets threatened an equaliser.  But it was effectively all over after 66 minutes, and Rooney was once again United's main man.  Slack marking by Watford allowed Smith too much space, and he cleverly picked out Rooney for a simple finish.  Watford were in danger of being swamped by United, and Lee needed to be alert again to deny Giggs.  There was one bonus for Watford late on when striker Marlon King, who has been out for virtually the whole season with knee injury, came on as a substitute to a rousing ovation.  Ronaldo was rested to give Richardson a run-out, and he made the most of it by running on to another superb pass from Smith to lift a finish over Lee with eight minutes left."
175,"Parents who want to see a secondary free school on the site of St Ursula's in Bristol have been told the academy would be prepared to consider the idea.  At present the school says it does not think there is enough demand to justify offering secondary education.  But it said if 60 parents in both Years 3 and 4 identified the proposed school as its first choice it would be happy to revisit the options.  More than 50 people attended a meeting on Thursday to hear the proposals.  School spokesman Mark Greatrex said at present they were concentrating on running the academy.  ""We would advise the parents of St Ursula's to continue seeking support for secondary school provision, with the required substantiating evidence,"" he said.  Conservative MP for Bristol North West, Charlotte Leslie, said historically there had been a lack of secondary school places for pupils from the BS9 postcode area.  She said in setting up a free school the Department for Education would present parents with a list of potential sponsors to fund the school but ultimately it was up to the parents to choose the most suitable sponsor.  Alistair Watson, cabinet member for children and young people on Bristol City Council, said he had been campaigning for the idea for the past 12 years and was ""very supportive"" of an all-through school on the site.  The original private St Ursula's Roman Catholic School ran into financial difficulties in 2010 and Bristol City Council bought the site for £1.95m.  It is now run as an academy and caters for about 120 children aged between four and 11."
176,"Chaminda Vaas made history by taking a hat-trick with the first three balls of the game as Sri Lanka recorded a crushing 10-wicket victory over Bangladesh.  Vaas then added a fourth victim in his opening over before finishing with six for 25.  Bangladesh, who ended the first over on five for four, partially recovered from the shock before being dismissed for 124 in the 32nd over.  But Sri Lanka needed only 21.1 overs to reach their target, openers Marvan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya both registering half-centuries.  Jayasuriya's decision to put Bangladesh in after winning the toss paid off in startling fashion as Vaas claimed four wickets in his opening over.  The next delivery accounted for Mohammad Ashraful, who played too early at an inswinger and lobbed a simple return catch.  It fell to Ehsanul Haque to try and prevent the hat-trick but he jabbed tentatively and the ball took the outside edge before being safely held by Mahela Jayawardene at second slip.  Vaas is the third bowler to claim a World Cup hat-trick. The Sri Lankan paceman also has the best ever bowling figures in a one-day international - eight for 19 against Zimbabwe in 2001 India's Chetan Sharma achieved the feat against New Zealand at Nagpur in 1987 and Pakistan's Saqlain Mushtaq bagged a treble against Zimbabwe at the Oval in 1999. Sanwar Hossain responded to the situation by hammering the fourth delivery of the over to the cover boundary. But two balls later he was trapped lbw by another inswinging delivery to leave Bangladesh on five for four at the end of the opening over. Worse was to come in the fifth over as Al Sahariar attempted a flamboyant drive and holed out to Aravinda de Silva at mid-off, giving Vaas his third five-wicket haul in a one-day international. Muttiah Muralitharan chipped in with three, as only Alok Kapali, Khaled Mashud and Mashrafe Mortaza got beyond 20 for Bangladesh. Jayasuriya and particularly Atapattu made light work of Bangladesh's weak bowling attack and they needed just 128 balls to overhaul the target of 124."
177,"The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court A newspaper group is paying £550,000 to the parents of Madeleine McCann after it settled a libel case over reports of her disappearance. Express Newspapers' titles, including the Daily Express, Daily Star and Sunday Express, are also printing front-page apologies. They say they were wrong to suggest the couple, of Rothley, Leicestershire, were responsible for Madeleine's death. The McCanns say the money will go to the Find Madeleine campaign. In a statement read out on behalf of the McCanns at the High Court on Wednesday, they said they were pleased that Express Newspapers had admitted the ""utter falsity"" of the numerous stories written about them over many months. Their spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, added that the allegations had caused them ""great distress"". It is understood that the sum donated to the campaign doubles the amount left in the fund. Madeleine disappeared, days before her fourth birthday, during a family holiday in the resort of Praia da Luz, in the Algarve, on 3 May last year. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, have been named as suspects in the case by Portuguese police but have always denied any involvement. Madeleine McCann went missing in Portugal in May 2007 The settlement was confirmed at a High Court hearing, although the amount of damages was not formally disclosed. It came after Wednesday's editions of the Daily Express and Daily Star both carried front-page apologies under the headline, ""Kate and Gerry McCann: Sorry"". The Express said it accepted that a ""number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up"". It also acknowledged there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support that theory. The paper added that Mr and Mrs McCann are ""completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance"". The Star said it was making a ""wholehearted apology to Kate and Gerry McCann for stories suggesting the couple were responsible for, or may be responsible for, the death of their daughter Madeleine and for covering it up"". Further apologies are expected in the publications' sister Sunday titles at the weekend. The libel action related to more than 100 stories across the four titles, including 42 printed in the Daily Express. I think this is an amazing stand-down, u-turn, by the Express newspapers    All four titles are published by the Express Newspapers group, which has agreed to all the McCanns' requests. It is also paying all their costs. A spokesman for the company said: ""We have nothing to add to what will be said in court and in our titles."" The McCanns' lawyers said that some of the newspapers' articles were ""grossly defamatory"". Richard Bilton, BBC News special correspondent, said one of the couple's representatives had said the response of the newspaper group was ""much more responsible than they were perhaps initially with these articles"". Media commentator Roy Greenslade said that for two national newspapers to carry front-page apologies at the same time was ""unprecedented"". ""I think this is an amazing stand-down, U-turn, by the Express newspapers,"" he said. The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court ""I think when people realise that more than 100 stories have been complained about as being grossly defamatory, it will annihilate the Express' readers sense of trust and credibility in their newspaper."" Media lawyer Paul Gilbert, from Finers Stephens Innocent, said the courts encourage early settlement of defamation cases. ""Clearly the Express' lawyers felt this was a case they should settle without a high-profile trial - which it would be - and as a result have saved considerable costs,"" he said. ""It certainly is a warning sign to newspapers in the future - if they're going to speculate, they've got to be very careful about what they speculate about."""
178,"It is the first time Barbie has had to relinquish the title since retail firms started monitoring sales a decade ago.  Sales of Bratz dolls - only released in the UK three years ago - are up 130% on last year, said the makers, after they captured girls' ""hearts and minds"".  Barbie remains number one in the wider sector, including dolls' clothing.  But the Bratz dolls - among them Yasmin, Jade, Sasha, Meygen and Fianna - are designed to be more streetwise and funky than Barbie.  The toys, which sell for about £22 each, appeal to girls aged eight and above with the slogan: ""The girls with a passion for fashion"".  Barbie - who will celebrate her 45th birthday this year - has a target audience from age three upwards but is battling against perceptions that she is outdated.  She ""broke up"" with long-term boyfriend Ken earlier this year - ditching him for surfer Blaine - in a bid to revitalise her fortunes.  But retail audit company NPD said Bratz had snatched a 41.5% share of the UK fashion doll market in August to outsell Barbie.  The firm said it was the first time Barbie, released by makers Mattel in 1959, had dropped from the country's top spot since 1994.  Nick Austin, chief executive of Bratz's UK distributors, said: ""Bratz came from nowhere and have captured the hearts and minds of a new generation of girls.""  He said it was a ""real David versus Goliath"" contest where an iconic brand had been toppled by a brand ""more relevant to today's fast-changing consumer"".  A spokesman for Mattel said: ""Barbie continues to connect with girls and mums all over the world.  ""She continues to outsell her nearest competitor by more than two-to-one in unit sales of dolls, clothes and accessories (in the) year to date, and is the number one girls' brand in the world with more than $3.6bn (£2bn) in annual retail sales."""
179,"The 7 O'clock News show is to finish but the hourly 60 Seconds bulletin will continue to broadcast.  BBC director of television Jana Bennett said the move, which was recommended by a recent report to raise the channel's impact, was a ""difficult decision"".  The BBC said it would minimise compulsory redundancies among the half-hour programme's 24 staff.  The change has been approved by Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell.  It follows the publication of the Barwise Report last autumn and the BBC's own qualitative audience research, which was undertaken earlier this year.  Professor Patrick Barwise, of the London Business School, recommended that BBC Three discontinue the 7 O'clock News bulletin to increase the channel's impact and value for money.  He also noted that the news needs of the channel's target audience of 25 to 34-year-olds were met elsewhere.  Ms Bennett said: ""We have taken this difficult decision because we know that the audience's news needs are being met in other ways.  ""We will now work to maximise the channel's value for money for licence payers without diminishing the channel's existing public service programming obligations or distinctiveness.""  She added that the slot would be filled with ""high quality"" factual programming, with money released from the change being used to raise ""knowledge building programmes"" from 45 to 50 hours a year.  BBC Three controller Stuart Murphy said the show had ""fought its corner"" against ""intense competition"".  ""I genuinely regret that the programme's audience impact was not significant enough to justify its existence,"" he said.  ""It is testament to the creativity of the bulletin's production team that many of the techniques it pioneered were subsequently adopted by mainstream news media.""  Last year's Barwise report into the BBC's digital TV channels was commissioned by the government.  Professor Barwise said the programme ""achieves nothing and attracts tiny audiences"".  But it was a key pillar of the ""public service"" commitment sought by Ms Jowell when approving BBC Three before its launch in 2003.  An earlier application to launch the channel, which did not contain a main evening news bulletin, was rejected in 2001."
180,"Their new status was being greeted as an important milestone although University of Wales degrees will still be awarded.  The changes are part of a modernisation within the university system in Wales.  The University of Wales, founded in 1893, called it a ""new era"" and a spokeswoman said: ""We're all moving forward and modernising our structure.""  It is felt that the changes could help the universities' ability to develop and compete for students.  Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff were original founding members of the University of Wales, while Swansea joined in 1920, and it grew to a federation of nine universities and colleges.  Two years ago, Cardiff University dropped out but remains an affiliated institution.  Swansea said it wished to have ""a full and mutually beneficial relationship"" with a modernised University of Wales and would still be awarding its degrees for ""the foreseeable future"".  Vice-chancellor Professor Richard B Davies said Swansea had ""truly come of age"".  He said: ""The formal change in our status is more than a symbolic name change.  ""It heralds a bright new era for the university, an era that will see our ambitious plans come to fruition and Swansea University becoming a truly world-class, research-led institution.""  He said it will include a revamped corporate image, including a ""fresh, modern look"" to the traditional university crest.  Owen Morgan, president of Swansea University's Students' Union, said: ""Students already know it as Swansea University, however it has taken time to get the name officially changed.  ""Will most students notice the change? Yes I think they probably will.  ""It is recognition for the students and staff who study and work here.""  Dr David Roberts, registrar at the re-named Bangor University, said the decision would not affect the 10,000 students or their degree programmes.  ""This is a legal and constitutional change, but it is a significant one in terms of the university's standing, and a very important milestone in our history.  ""It shows great confidence in the activities, policies and procedures of the university.""  Aberystwyth University has not made any formal statement but is expected to reveal a new corporate image next month.  The developments also reflect major changes at the University of Wales, which will cease to be a federal institution.  A review of its role, functions and structure was held in 2005, chaired by former Plaid Cymru leader Dafydd Wigley.  The university plans to still be accrediting and validating degrees, while also continuing to have a role in research and protecting and promoting the language and culture of Wales."
181,"  A ""most notorious"" henchman     There is no doubt that Gautier de la Salle existed, and he did hold a position of responsibility in the Guernsey administration. His name heads a list of Bailiffs of Guernsey dated 1284, but no other written record has ever been found to prove he did hold that particular office. Patent rolls - lists of patents issued - from the 14th Century give us a glimpse of the real de la Salle.     In 1313-14 they say that protection was granted to ""Walter de la Salle, a clerk going to the islands of Gerneseye and Jerseye"", and in 1319 he is described as a ""minister"" of Warden Otto de Grandison.   St Peter Port, home of Gautier de la Salle   © Courtesy of the Guernsey Tourist Board L James Marr in ""A History of the Bailiwick of Guernsey"" describes him as one of Otto’s ""most notorious henchmen"", whose hanging in 1320 (not 1284) was Guernsey’s ""outstanding ‘cause celebre’"". Thus Gautier was indeed executed, but for very different reasons to those popularised by local legend.     It appears the whole saga began in 1302, with the murder of a monk on the small island of Lihou, off the west coast of Guernsey, by the Prior's servant Thomas le Roer. The Bailiff of Guernsey, Peter le Marchant, set out to arrest le Roer, accompanied by several jurats (legal officials). Le Roer resisted arrest, however, and after a struggle was killed by Ranulph Gautier, one of the jurats, who then sought sanctuary in St Sampson’s church, before escaping to England.     After only a few months, Ranulph Gautier obtained Edward II’s pardon and was able to return to Guernsey, but records show that his troubles were not yet over. Several years after his return, Ranulph was inveigled into Castle Cornet, tortured, and killed, by several of the Warden’s officials, including Gautier de la Salle and William l'Enginour.     The reasons for this are unknown - the only clue we have of any ill-feeling being a record that l'Enginour had previously stolen a silver cup from Ranulf Gautier.

182,"Passing sentence, Sheriff Kathrine Mackie said a social enquiry assessment had concluded there was a significant risk of Watson re-offending.  However, the sheriff reduced his sentence from 20 months to 16 because of his pre-trial guilty plea.  Lord Watson, 56, admitted setting fire to a curtain after a heavy drinking session at the Scottish Politician of the Year awards ceremony at the Prestonfield House Hotel last November.  After being sentenced, Watson was taken to Saughton Prison in Edinburgh. He will be transferred to a prison near his home in the next week.  He had initially denied he was responsible, despite CCTV footage showing him crouching down at the base of a curtain just minutes before it was engulfed in flames.  After pleading guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court at the beginning of September, he stepped down as an MSP, triggering a by-election in his former Glasgow Cathcart constituency, and resigned as a director of Dundee United football club.  Sheriff Mackie said: ""Fire-raising is a most serious crime.  ""By pleading guilty to this charge you have acknowledged that you intended to set on fire property at Prestonfield House Hotel whereby property was damaged and lives were endangered.  ""The potential for serious injury to guests and staff within the hotel, and for very significant damage to the property, was considerable.""  The sheriff said that it was due to the prompt action of staff that there was neither injury nor more significant damage.  She said there had been no explanation for his actions.  Outside the court, Watson's spokesman said: ""He just wants to say that his wife Clare has stood by him like a rock during a phenomenally difficult time and she continues to stand by him.  ""He would also like to thank what he would term his true friends, who have really stood by him during this time.  ""I think when you are close to someone like his wife is, you hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Probably the worst fears were realised today.""  The sentence was announced from the platform at the Scottish National Party annual conference in Aviemore following a debate about the House of Lords, and was met with a large cheer from delegates.  In a statement, a Labour spokesman said: ""Mr Watson has been expelled from the Labour Party.  ""His sentence illustrates that if you commit a serious crime in Scotland, no matter who you are, you must face the consequences. That is right.""  Scottish Conservative home affairs spokeswoman and deputy leader Annabel Goldie said: ""The sentence actually served will not be 16 months.  ""Thanks to Labour and Lib Dem insistence of preserving automatic early release, Lord Watson will be out of jail after serving only half his sentence, eight months."""
183,"The UK, Germany and Italy were among 14 states which allowed the US to forcibly remove terror suspects, lawmakers said.  The EU parliament voted to accept a resolution condemning member states which accepted or ignored the practice.  The EU report said the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, some taking suspects to states where they could face torture.  The report was adopted by a large majority, with 382 MEPs voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining.  The final version denounces the lack of co-operation of many EU member states and it condemns the actions of secret services and governments who accepted and concealed renditions.  It is unlikely, the report says, that European governments were unaware of rendition activities on their territory, something the British government, among others, has denied.  ""This is a report that doesn't allow anyone to look the other way. We must be vigilant that what has been happening in the past five years may never happen again,"" said Italian Socialist Giovanni Fava, who drafted the document.  The parliament also called for an ""independent inquiry"" to be considered and for closure of the US' Guantanamo Bay detention camp.  Human rights campaigning group Amnesty International welcomed the EU lawmakers' vote, but urged member states to carry out independent investigations.  Although the report has no force in EU law, Mr Fava said during the parliamentary debate that the related investigation, over a year, had uncovered much new evidence.  Many of those taken from EU states were subjected to torture to extract information from them, the report said.  It said there was a ""strong possibility"" that this intelligence had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained.  It also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used as the flights made their journey across Europe towards countries such as Afghanistan.  It was not possible to contradict evidence or suggestions that secret detention centres were operated in Poland and Romania, the report said.  Centre-right MEPs - the largest group in parliament - have been highly critical of the report, saying it is primarily motivated by anti-Americanism.  EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said the commission would act on the truth, even if it were uncomfortable or unpalatable. But he called for a relaunching of the Euro-Atlantic relationship and said Europe must continue to work with its US partners.  During the course of their investigation, delegations of MEPs travelled to countries including Romania, Poland, the UK, the US and Germany to investigate claims of European involvement in so-called extraordinary renditions.  The governments of Austria, Italy, Poland, Portugal and the UK were criticised for their ""unwillingness to co-operate"" with investigators.  The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where ""an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture""."
184,"Meet Mr Elias Elia. He's the chief executive of E-Clear, amongst other roles. One of those other roles is fascinating - of which, more later.  But let's start with E-Clear. That's the company, based in Mayfair, London, which handles credit card transactions for airlines, and which is uncomfortably close to the demise of Globespan and flyGlobespan airline.  To recap - we've been told by its administrator that Globespan was owed around £30m (and I'm told more) by E-Clear. This was money that had been paid for tickets, but which had not been passed on to the airline.  We also know that the administrators think a very large chunk of that, at least half, was money paid for tickets on flights that had already landed. There seemed no clear reason why that money continued to be withheld, after it ceased to carry the risk of being reclaimed.  That's what got Finance Secretary John Swinney steamed up with indignation at E-Clear's role, while being interviewed on Radio Scotland earlier today.  And at last, E-Clear has started doing some responding. It released a statement this afternoon, in which Mr Elia sympathises with those affected by Globespan's collapse. Here it is in full:  ""London, 18 December 2009 - The directors of E-Clear wish to express the company's deepest sympathy for the customers and staff of Flyglobespan affected by the airline's move into administration.   Particularly at this time of year it is a distressing situation for all involved.  ""E-Clear is committed to working closely with the administrators of The Globespan Group to clarify and address the various complexities around the airline's financial position, so that matters may be resolved as quickly as possible.  ""E-Clear's chief executive officer Elias Elia says: 'As one of the world's leading payment card processing companies, we have many years'   experience in the airline industry and we will bring this expertise to bear in pursuit of an equable solution that reflects the interests of all parties'.""  And that's all. Obviously, it leaves some questions hanging in the air.  E-Clear and administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers are discussing today what was owed. The credit card transactions company wants to stress that the administrator has not blamed the airline's collapse on a lack of cash flow.  What joint administrator Bruce Cartwright did say yesterday was that the airline had sustained a big loss two years ago, and it needed an injection of capital. But in a media briefing, he went on to leave little doubt that the large amount of money owed was the key issue he had yet to understand.  It seems there had been a disagreement between Globespan's (former) management and E-Clear about how much money was owed. Some cash continued to flow to Globespan, but its offer of appointing an independent auditor to adjudicate the dispute was, I'm told, not accepted by E-Clear.  It is also being claimed by E-Clear's PR team that a finance company withholding money from credit card transactions is entitled to continue doing so even AFTER the flight has landed - up to six months later, because there are some circumstances in which an insurance claim can still be made on that ticket.  ""In E-Clear's position, it covers its exposure to future risk on flights that may have been cancelled in the past. It's not possible to quantify what claims may come in, so it's necessary to be prudent.""  Globespan could no longer get insurance industry cover from July last year - before the collapse of Zoom and XL. So E-Clear's response after that was to insure itself by withholding money for much longer.  But here we get to the really interesting bit. Earlier this week, Globespan's chief executive, founder and chief shareholder, Tom Dalrymple, issued a couple of statements saying the airline management continued to be in discussion with a company called Halcyon Investments, about an injection of capital.  Halcyon had been in discussions with flyGlobespan going back at least as far as September, which was around the point when others who were interested in investing in the airline pulled out.  What do we know about Halcyon Investments? Not much, except that it was registered as a trust in Jersey during August of last year.  But now that E-Clear has started communicating, we know more about it. It's a group of high net-worth individuals, and as a trust, it does not have directors. One of those investors is informally described as ""the lead representative"", and is one and the same Elias Elia.  So he was chief executive of E-Clear while it was in dispute with flyGlobespan over a very large amount of money - enough, it could be argued, to explain the airline's financial collapse this week.  At the same time, Halcyon Investment, led by Mr Elia, was negotiating with Globespan management to take over the company, or at least to take a large stake in it.  Could there, perhaps, be a conflict of interest?  The answer: ""There were different investors in Halcyon, so any exposure to risk that E-Clear had or has would not have been affected by Halcyon's attempt to secure a future for flyGlobespan.  ""E-Clear and Halcyon Investments are two entirely separate entities.   The two companies operated independently"".  Allbury Travel Group has ceased trading this morning, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. Based in Hertfordshire, it included the brands Libra Holidays, Argo Holidays and JetLife, and flew out of English airports to Greece, Cyprus and Egypt.  More than 100 holiday-makers have been left stranded, and arrangements are being made to bring them home, while there were 4000 forward bookings.  Credit card transactions for buying Allbury Travel Group holidays were carried out by E-Clear.  Allbury Travel Group is a subsidiary of Allbury Ltd, a Virgin Islands company in which the controlling interest is reported to be a Mr Elias Elia.  I've tried to find out more from Mr Elia, but less than 24 hours after taking on a public relations agency to deal with unwelcome E-Clear publicity, the two have parted company. And he's not answering calls."
185,"I hope The Last Kingdom will expand BBC Two’s distinctive portfolio of drama. It’s an epic narrative with an extraordinary creative team. It will feel like nothing else on television, with all of the scale and intrigue of the best fantasy stories but the reality of fact.  BBC Two, BBC America and Carnival Films, the Golden Globe and Emmy award-winning producers, today announced that production would begin in the autumn on The Last Kingdom, a new historical 8x60' drama series.  BAFTA nominated and RTS award-winning writer Stephen Butchard (Good Cop, Five Daughters, House Of Saddam) will adapt Bernard Cornwell’s best-selling franchise 'The Saxon Stories' for the screen. Cornwell is also known for his much-loved 'Sharpe' novels that became the long-running TV series of the same name starring Sean Bean.  Set in the year 872, when many of the separate kingdoms of what we now know as England have fallen to the invading Vikings, the great kingdom of Wessex has been left standing alone and defiant under the command of King Alfred the Great.  Against this turbulent backdrop lives our hero, Uhtred. Born the son of a Saxon nobleman, he is orphaned by the Vikings and then kidnapped and raised as one of their own. Forced to choose between the country of his birth and the people of his upbringing, his loyalties are ever tested. What is he - Saxon or Viking? On a quest to claim his birthright, Uhtred must tread a dangerous path between both sides if he is to play his part in the birth of a new nation and, ultimately, seek to recapture his ancestral lands.  The Last Kingdom, made by Carnival Films (Downton Abbey), is a show full of heroic deeds and epic battles but with a thematic depth that embraces politics, religion, warfare, courage, love, loyalty and our universal search for identity. Combining real historical figures and events with fictional characters, it is the story of how a people combined their strength under one of the most iconic kings of history in order to reclaim their land for themselves and build a place they call home.  Gareth Neame, Nigel Marchant and Stephen Butchard will serve as executive producers with Nick Murphy (Prey, Occupation) co-executive producing and directing multiple episodes and Chrissy Skinns (Mr Selfridge, Marchlands) producing the show. The Commissioning Editor is Polly Hill for the BBC and Ben Stephenson, Controller of BBC Drama Commissioning, ordered the show. Perry Simon, General Manager, Channels, and Richard De Croce, SVP Programming, will oversee the series for BBC America.  “Cornwell's Saxon novels combine historical figures and events with fiction in an utterly compelling way,” said Gareth Neame.  “In the hands of Stephen Butchard we believe it will make original and engrossing television drama. In part the epic quest of our hero Uhtred, it is also a fascinating re-telling of the tale of King Alfred the Great and how he united the many separate kingdoms on this island into what would become England.”  Kim Shillinglaw, Controller, BBC Two, adds: ""BBC Two has a great reputation for distinctive, surprising drama - I'm delighted we are doing The Last Kingdom, an epic piece from a highly regarded creative team.""  Ben Stephenson, Controller, BBC Drama Commissioning, says: “I hope The Last Kingdom will expand BBC Two’s distinctive portfolio of drama. It’s an epic narrative with an extraordinary creative team. It will feel like nothing else on television, with all of the scale and intrigue of the best fantasy stories but the reality of fact.”"
186,"As widely expected, the top job has been handed to James Murdoch, the youngest son of the broadcaster's chairman and biggest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch.  Mr Murdoch's media empire News Corporation is, of course, no stranger to seeing Mr Murdoch's children at the helm.  His daughter Elizabeth has already done a stint as head of programmes at BSkyB.  But James Murdoch's appointment has irked some City investors, who are concerned that the new arrangement gives too much control to NewsCorp.  There are also some question marks over the business track record of James Murdoch, who, at just 30, becomes the youngest chief executive in FTSE 100 history.  Rupert Murdoch has six children from three marriages, including Elizabeth, Lachlan and James, from his marriage to Anna, which ended in divorce in 1999.  Lachlan, who oversees the New York Post and the Fox television service, has always been favourite to head the family business.  But in recent years, James has emerged a serious contender for the succession.  As a teenager, he was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch brood but was also something of a rebel.  He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Mirror, the paper where Rupert Murdoch cut his journalistic teeth.  Unfortunately, young James made headlines in the rival Sydney Morning Herald, after he was pictured asleep on a sofa at a press conference.  At Harvard, where he studied film and history, James edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the satirical magazine, Lampoon.  He dropped out of college in 1995, to set-up a hip-hop record label, Rawkus, with friends.  The company was turning a small profit of $2.5m a year when it was bought by News Corporation in 1998.  Now back inside the family fold, James was installed as the head of News Corporation's tiny music division, and continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.  He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet, with mixed results.  He is also credited with firing his father's interest in the internet.  At one point, James reportedly tried to persuade Murdoch senior to part with $450m for an internet business called Pointcast, which was later sold to another company for $7m.  Mercifully for News Corporation's shareholders, Rupert Murdoch was a latecomer to cyberspace and his enthusiasm was short-lived.  News Corporation had its fingers burnt in the dot.com crash like everyone else - but not nearly as badly as rivals such as AOL Time Warner and Disney.  One internet venture that did get off the ground was ill-fated Australian telecom company One-Tel, a joint venture between James, elder brother Lachlan and James Packer, whose father Kerry, is Rupert Murdoch's oldest commercial rival.  The company collapsed in 2001 amid acrimony and massive debts.  By this time, the newly married James had moved to Hong Kong to take charge of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service StarTV.  This proved to be the turning point his career - and the foundation of his claim to be a credible contender for the top job at BSkyB, regardless of his surname.  When James took over at Star 1999, the company was losing £100m a year.  Last year it turned a small profit and is poised for growth, thanks to new channels and distribution deals with India, China and Taiwan.  James is said by executives that have worked with him to have an instinctive grasp for marketing pay TV services, and his skill in dealing with the Chinese government has also impressed.  He is also said to be close to his 72-year-old father, whom he calls ""Pop"", and speaks to him each day on the phone.  But it will take more than a knack for diplomacy and the ear of his father to impress City investors, who own the lion's share of BSkyB.  Rupert Murdoch has reportedly refused to stand down as BSkyB chairman in order to allay concerns about corporate governance.  The pressure will be on James to shake off the ""Daddy's Boy"" tag and prove he is his own man."
187,"Virtual Replay: 3D animation of the key moments from the match Zinedine Zidane scored a majestic free-kick and a penalty in injury time to secure holders France a stunning victory over England in Group B. Frank Lampard had given England a first-half lead when he rose to head home David Beckham's free-kick. The brilliant Wayne Rooney won England a second-half penalty, but Beckham saw his spot-kick saved by Fabien Barthez. Zidane equalised with a free-kick and then converted from the spot after David James fouled Thierry Henry. That late double blow left England's players inconsolable at the final whistle, whilst the French stayed on the pitch to celebrate their opening game win. The atmosphere at the Estadio Da Luz was electric as both teams finally started their Euro 2004 campaigns. And while England captain Beckham and France skipper Zidane, team-mates at Real Madrid, exchanged pleasantries in the tunnel before kick-off, there was no room for friendship on the field. We have to win two games against Switzerland and Croatia and I think we can do that    The pre-match hype - the game being England's biggest since their World Cup quarter-final defeat to Brazil in 2002 - added an extra edge to the encounter where duels between club team-mates were abundant. Henry of Arsenal faced Sol Campbell in an England defence shorn of the services of John Terry, who was replaced by Ledley King. England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson opted to stick with the 4-4-2 formation which had worked so well in the 6-1 Euro 2004 warm-up win over Iceland. England's midfield quartet of Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, Lampard and Beckham settled quickly, allowing them to absorb some early France pressure. The action as it happened Zidane, Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires produced the fluid football so typical of the French, to whom the first real goalscoring opportunity fell when David Trezeguet headed over from Vieira's precision cross. For England, Scholes combined well with the outstanding Rooney before the Manchester United midfielder picked out Michael Owen going in on goal. Only the close attention of William Gallas prevented Owen from testing Barthez as France cleared their lines. Gallas also had to be alert to deny Gerrard, who had surged into the area following an England counter-attack. King, who was starting his first match for England, looked impressive and the anonymity of Henry in the first half owed much to the Spurs centre-half's concentration at the back. The England defender made an important clearance to cut out Vieira's flick-on as France sought to test James. We can thank Fabien for making the difference    Yet in truth, for all France's possession, England goalkeeper James had little to do in the first half. And England's controlled approach - epitomised by the superb holding play of Rooney - paid dividends just before half time. Lizarazu sent Beckham tumbling on the right-hand side of the France area and the England captain picked himself to deliver a teasing cross which Lampard headed past a stationary Barthez. It was the first time the French defence had been breached in 11 games, but that record was of no interest to England's fans, who could not contain their glee. The onus was very much on France to pick up the pace after the break and one lightning quick counter-attack saw Vieira surge forward before finding Henry, whose curled shot was gathered by James. Henry started to become more influential as the game wore on, but it was the raw aggression of Rooney that stood out as he tormented France with his power and pace. If England had anything to prove it was that they could produce a strong second-half display. Eriksson replaced the ineffective Owen with Darius Vassell in an attempt to freshen things up and, just as signs of weariness were creeping into the play, Rooney stormed forward. The Everton teenager was crudely hacked down by Mikael Silvestre, who was fortunate to receive only a caution, and England were duly awarded a penalty. But Beckham saw his spot-kick brilliantly saved by Barthez to give France a lifeline. And England were made to pay a heavy price for that miss in the dying minutes of the game. We are annoyed and upset but all is not lost and we should still get through    Have your say on 606 Substitute Emile Heskey needlessly gave away a foul on the edge of the area and the imperious Zidane strode forward to send a curling free-kick past James. And England then lost all sense of discipline when Gerrard attempted a dangerous back-pass to James, with Henry in close pursuit. The France striker pounced on the loose ball and was hauled to the ground by a despairing James. Referee Markus Merk pointed to the spot and Zidane showed no nerves as he converted the penalty with aplomb to hand France victory and control of Group B.      18-year-old Wayne Rooney became the second youngest player to play in a European Championship finals match. The record holder is Enzo Scifo who was only 18 years three months and 25 days old when he made his European Championship debut for Belgium exactly 20 years ago. Lilian Thuram made his 100th international appearance for France. He is only the third Frenchman to collect a century of caps following Marcel Desailly (115 caps) and Didier Deschamps (103 caps). He becomes the seventh player at Euro 2004 with over 100 caps. Frank Lampard's opening goal put an end to France's clean sheet streak of 11 matches. The last time France had conceded a goal was against Turkey in the Confederations Cup on June 26, 2003. They had gone 1,077 minutes without conceding a goal. David Beckham's missed penalty was the 14th missed spot kick in regulation time at the European Championships. It was also the first time England have failed to convert a regulation time penalty kick in a European Championship finals match.                  England need to be bold What went wrong with Beckham? What now for Greek stars?     "
188,"But increasingly game makers want their creations to match the real world in one crucial respect. Namely the physics used to underpin the action, reaction and interaction of every element in the game world.  Not long ago games action was notoriously uniform. Fire a rocket and the resulting explosion would look the same every time. The scenery may not even be damaged.  But better physics means you can let the computer work out what happens when rockets are fired at zombies, bunnies or rebounding surfaces. It will be different every time.  The physics in ground-breaking games such as Half-Life 2 and Doom III is only the beginning.  Limits on the processing power and computer memory available to game makers means that only relatively large rigid bodies were modelled effectively in these recent titles.  This means that you get a good idea of what happens when grenades meet packing crates or circular saw blades interact with zombies. What you get is everything splitting or shattering into relatively large chunks.  It does mean that it is hard to model the interaction of anything smaller than those chunks or such things as liquids.  But even this offers a huge range of possibilities so much so that in Half-Life 2 players get a gravity gun that lets them take advantage of the realistic action/reaction and interaction of objects. Many of the puzzles in the game that held up the progress of its central character Gordon Freeman revolved around exploiting physics.  David O'Meara, chief executive of physics software firm Havok, said Half-Life 2 offers a hint of what is to come.  ""Half-Life 2 is the standard now in terms of what the consumers sees,"" he said. ""But it was developed over a number of years and the standard of physics today is not what the consumer sees.""  Already there are games that can model interactions using elements as small as bullets and realistically show what happens when they hit a foot or ankle, said Mr O'Meara.  The next big change is modelling interactions between objects and environments made of particles - effectively big molecules.  This will give game designers unprecedented freedom to build worlds and have the objects, animals and people in them react to each other like their real world equivalents.  The next generation of consoles and powerful desktop PCs will give designers the scope to model entire worlds of such small elements, said Mr O'Meara, although there were going to be moments when other things, such as animation of faces have prior calls on memory and processing power.  There are also more firms producing physics engines, such as Ageia, Meqon and others, that developers can use to give games a more realistic feel.  ""There are games coming out where we know what's been achieved and it is at least as startling as what has been seen in Half-Life 2,"" he said.  Better physics is not just restricted to consoles and PCs. Mobile phones are getting their own physics engines too.  As its name implies the game gives the player to chance to emulate the antics and tricks of Motocross superstar Nate Adams.  Though it features only a bike, rider and a variety of hilly courses the game is surprisingly challenging, thanks to physics, said Darren Hedges, an I-Play developer who helped put the title together.  Key presses control how far forward and back the in-game Nate leans which radically changes the way the bike reacts.  ""In a normal sprite-based system if a bike was to crash into the ground at a series of intervals it would always look the same,"" he said.  ""But good physics means that Nate comes off his bike a myriad of different ways with a myriad number of results,"" said Mr Hedges.  ""It allows us to have bike and rider as two separate entities and that allows the user to be punished for making mistakes,"" he said.  ""We don't want the game punishing the user,"" he said. ""We want the user punishing the user."""
189,"At least 15 people have been killed and 55 hurt in a bombing at a mosque in north Yemen, security sources say.  The blast occurred as Friday prayers ended at the Ben Salman mosque, often used by members of the security services, in Saada city.  Local officials have been cited as saying the bomb was hidden in a car or a motorcycle.  Abdulmalik al-Houthi, the leader of a Shia rebellion in the area, denied responsibility for the blast.  ""We criticise and condemn this regrettable incident,"" he said in an interview with al-Jazeera television.  ""We deny completely any role in this incident. It is not part of our ethics to target any mosque or any worshippers at all.""  Hundreds of people have been killed in clashes in the region since a conflict between pro-government forces and rebels loyal to Mr Houthi broke out in 2004.  A BBC correspondent in Yemen says the mosque is often used by members of the security forces, which might have made it a target.  The region is a Shia stronghold, while most Yemenis are Sunni Muslims.  The Yemeni government says Mr al-Houthi's rebels want to overthrow it and impose Shia religious law. The rebels say they are defending their community against discrimination and what they call aggressive acts by the government.  Groups affiliated with al Qaeda have also staged attacks in Yemen.

190,"The sheep have been released on a hillside beside the M8 between junctions three and four and is the brainchild of Pyramid Business Park.  The stunt in Bathgate was set up ""for a bit of fun"" to ""brighten things up"".  Farmer Andrew Jack, who owns the 54-strong flock, spent hours spray painting the woolly mammals. They will be red for a month until sheared.  He said: ""They are causing quite a stir with passers-by. It is a bit of fun and it does brighten things up.  ""It was a bit messy and it really did take a while, but they look fantastic.  ""We used a sheep spray, but it was totally animal friendly and would not do them any harm. We will leave them like that until it is time to shear their coats off.""  It comes after the M8 Art project which created artistic talking points along the main travel corridor between east and west.  The 'Sawtooth Ramps', which quickly became known as the pyramids, were the first to be installed in 1993 by artist Patricia Leighton.  They were followed by the 80 foot high 'Horn', which transmits recorded music, poetry and prose, the 'Big Heids' at Eurocentral Terminal site and the Iron Horse at Easterhouse.  Craig Chalmers, senior facilities manager at Pyramids Business Park, said: ""We wanted to do something different to brighten up the area and make it a nicer place to work.  ""The sheep have become a huge attraction. They look fantastic and they serve the double process of maintaining the grass on the pyramids.  ""The dyes are obviously animal friendly and we are now considering replacing them with pink sheep when these ones have their coats sheared."""
191,"They say many clergy are unprepared to deal with the mental health problems they face on a day-to-day basis.  But on Monday they will say it is the duty of religious groups to care for the mentally ill.  The Religion and Severe Mental Illness Conference aims to ""raise awareness of the issue of mental illness as the proper concern of religious leaders and those involved in or associated with religion"".  It will be addressed by leaders of Christianity, Islam and Judaism.  They will discuss how religion can provide support to other community workers in the care of mentally ill patients, and will explore the wider issues of how religion can help people cope with mental illness.  Psychiatrists acknowledge that a mentally ill patient's strong religious beliefs can provide a solid platform for therapy.  This is because much therapy will begin with something the patient holds as certain and building from there.  Martin Aaron, chairman of the association, is also a member of a multi-faith working party on mental illness.  ""In the majority of cases they haven't the experience or knowledge of what to say or do, or who to recommend the person to.  One of the aims of the conference is to rectify this, he said.  He said the clergy will receive training in how to tackle mental health problems, which would be ""a great support to local services"".  He said this would be an important addition to the concept of care in the community.  The conference will also look at religion's treatment of mental illness in the past.  ""It's the old indoctrination into the minds of our forebears that's been handed down for centuries.  ""People think of people who have a severe mental illness as being demonic and likely to kill you if you meet them in the streets.""  He said this still persisted in the way the media presents the rare incidents where a mentally ill person attacks a member of the public.  People have also misunderstood the causes of mental illness through the ages.  Dr Badawi said Muslim culture had always supported mentally ill people, although some people may have been over-zealous in their attempts to cure them.  Traditional Islamic belief has it that mental illness is caused by a djin - or genie - entering the afflicted person.  The belief that spirits cause mental illness by invading an individual is common to all the major religions.  In some cases, people would try to beat the djin out of the patient, and sometimes this could result in death, Dr Badawi said.  But now Muslims in developed western countries have adopted the views of science, that mental illness is a function of the body, and is caused by genes and chemical activity in the brain, he said.  ""Modern educated Muslims would not accept that the djin goes into the body. The treatment now is that people would go to psychiatrist.""  It has always been a part of Islam to care for the ill, Dr Badawi said.  This is still the case now - the modern Muslim community in Europe is likely to provide a network of support for the mentally ill, he said.  One example he gave was that of a man with schizophrenia who called himself Mufti 666 - the word mufti means a specialist in religion.  He would send Dr Badawi re-interpretations of the Koran and make predictions about the future.  ""People looked after him,"" Dr Badawi said.  ""Sometimes they laughed at some of his hallucinations or silly ideas, but that does not mean they in any way shunned him - he was part of the community.""  Through the ages some people have also seen the mentally ill as more religious as others - in stark contrast to the popular demonisation of such people.  ""There were those who thought they were just afflicted - that God wished them to be so sick and that's it.  ""Then others considered that perhaps they are the chosen of God, they are really saints - they have no grip on reality because the only reality to them is God."""
192,"Ground-penetrating scans of a park have revealed three near-complete Roman buildings in Chichester.  Archaeologists, who were left stunned by the degree of preservation, have said the only reason they survived was because Priory Park was never built on.  Two houses and a third building were found. Moving images from a scan show the shapes of two buildings emerge.  It is thought the houses in Noviomagus Reginorum - the Roman name for the town - were owned by people of importance.  For more archaeology stories follow our Pinterest board  More news from Sussex here  Local geophysics specialist David Staveley, who had set out to identify all the city's Roman roads, was given permission to scan the parks because some might have survived there.  Following his scans, a small dig was carried out in Priory Park.  It is thought the houses were originally on a street but the road did not survive.  James Kenny, an archaeologist at Chichester District Council, said the scans showed a townhouse with rooms and a freestanding building in the corner.  ""It's difficult to say what it might have been, but the walls did survive. It might have been part of a bathhouse, or a cellar, or a winter dining room with under-floor heating,"" he said.  Mr Kenny admitted there was ""nothing exceptional"" about a Roman house in a Roman town.  But he said: ""What's exceptional is in a Roman town like Chichester, most of the archaeology has been interrupted by all sorts of house building.""  Added to that, the city had no sewers until the 1880s and people had to dig holes in the ground, he said.  ""An awful lot of archaeology was lost.""  However, Priory Park, originally home to a monastery, had not been developed, and the buildings buried 0.5m below the surface showed a ""remarkable degree of preservation"", Mr Kenny said.  Further exploration will take place this year and there may also be a larger investigation in the future.  Scans also revealed another Roman street under the park, but this will not be uncovered."
193,"Legislation that affects just England should normally need backing by a majority of MPs who represent English constituencies, a report says.  The McKay Commission said such a principle should be enshrined in a resolution of the House of Commons.  The commission was launched last year to consider whether Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish MPs should be denied a vote on English-only matters.  The government said it would give the report ""serious consideration"".  But the English Democrats, who campaign for a separate parliament for England, called the proposals a ""fudge"" which failed to address ""the real issue"" of creating equal democratic rights across the UK.  There has been controversy over the so-called West Lothian Question - the ability of Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish MPs to vote on England-only matters - for several decades, but this intensified after devolution.  In 2004, support from Scottish and Welsh MPs allowed the government to push through the introduction of university top-up fees in England.  The commission concluded that the current situation was ""unsustainable"" and changes were needed.  It proposed the principle that Commons decisions with a ""separate and distinct effect"" for England should ""normally be taken only with the consent of a majority of MPs sitting for constituencies in England"".  The same would apply for decisions that affected only England and Wales.  The report said the principle should be enshrined in a resolution of the House, and suggested a range of procedural changes to entrench the approach.  Specific parliamentary time could be allocated to debating plans for England, and MPs would be given an opportunity to vote on motions endorsing or rejecting them.  Committees for scrutinising bills could also be weighted to represent the party balance in England, the report suggested.  However, the commission dismissed as ""flawed and impractical"" a more drastic suggestion, which would require England-only legislation to get a majority of English MPs, as well as an overall majority.  Instead of such a ""double lock"", the commission floated the idea of a ""double count"", where the proportion of English MPs supporting a Bill would be published alongside the overall result.  ""If a government was seen to have failed to attract the support of a majority of MPs from England [or England and Wales] for business affecting those interests, it would be likely to sustain severe political damage,"" it says.  Commission chairman Sir William McKay said Westminster law-making had inevitably come to focus on England, or England and Wales.  ""But the processes for making law at Westminster have not significantly changed,"" he said.  ""Surveys have shown that people in England are unhappy about the existing arrangements and support change.  ""There is a feeling that England is at a disadvantage, and that it's not right that MPs representing the devolved nations should be able to vote on matters affecting England.  ""The status quo clearly cannot be sustained.""  A Cabinet Office spokesman said the government was ""very grateful to Sir William McKay and his colleagues for their work"".  ""This is a very important issue, which is why the government asked this expert commission to look into it.  ""We will give the report very serious consideration before we respond substantively,"" he said.  English Democrats chairman Robin Tilbrook said: ""The commission was set up to come up with a fudge and that is what it has done. It fails to address the real issue.  ""The issue isn't how the House of Commons works. It is that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own parliaments and governments and England does not. We need a democratic government and parliament for England."""
194,"Derry City Council has taken the first steps towards bringing private investment to City of Derry of Airport.  A holding company will be set up with the council retaining 100% of the shares.  As part of the reforms the council are conducting a market test, to seek expressions of interest from private investors.  The chairman of the airport committee, Colm Eastwood, said the current level of public subsidy is unsustainable.  ""Reform is driven by our commitment to reduce annual public subvention of £3.5million, a need to strengthen the airport's commercial performance and a requirement by government to establish a new governance regime.  ""The airport business plan demonstrates the capability for long-term revenue and passenger growth and we must make decisions that enable the airport to operate effectively in a very competitive environment.  ""However, the continuation of public subsidy at its current level is unsustainable and it is essential that Council progress steps to reduce this level of subvention,"" Councillor Eastwood added.  ""Our aim is to ensure the region has an affordable and successful airport and this sequence of reform will safeguard investment and growth.""  Under the new holding company structure Derry City Council will be 100% shareholders in CODA (holdings).  The CODA company will own two subsidiaries that will operate the airport and hold the lands and facilities that make up the airport."
195,"Dr Fox, a 44-year-old former GP, got 42 votes - well above his publicly declared support of 23 MPs.  He said he had a ""great chance"" of making it into the top two in Thursday's vote, and so going through to the run-off vote of party members.  ""We've polled way above what anyone was predicting even this morning,"" he said.  ""I think we have got a great chance of getting into the last round and giving the party a real choice.  ""It is clear that we have got a lot of support from right across the party as we go into the next ballot.  ""I think a lot of votes will be moving around in a lot of directions in the next few days.""  Shadow Scottish secretary Eleanor Laing, a key Fox supporter, said she was pleased with the result.  ""Liam is the man who can unite the party and who has the momentum behind him,"" she said.  She added that he had both youth and experience on his side as well as energy and vision."
196,"Although most of the Bloody Sunday Tribunal evidence was heard in Londonderry, the soldiers who were there on 30 January 1972 appeared in London amid security concerns.  Soldiers who were on the ground at the time of the shootings gave evidence anonymously. They were not granted immunity from prosecution; only immunity from self-incrimination.  Colonel Wilford was directly in charge of the soldiers who went into the Bogside to arrest rioters. It was his job to run a successful operation to round up trouble-makers, protect the public and get his troops back to base unharmed.  But Saville concludes that the soldiers only went into the Bogside because the colonel went further than his orders from Brigadier MacLellan. His superior wanted to avoid running battles that would make it impossible to distinguish between rioters and peaceful marchers.  ""Colonel Wilford either deliberately disobeyed Brigadier MacLellan's order or failed for no good reason to appreciate the clear limits of what he had been authorised to do,"" said Saville.  ""Colonel Wilford decided to send Support Company into the Bogside because at the time he gave the order he had concluded (without informing Brigadier MacLellan) that there was now no prospect of making any, or any significant, arrests in the area he had originally suggested, as the rioting was dying down and people were moving away.  ""In addition it appears to us that he wanted to demonstrate that the way to deal with rioters in Londonderry was not for soldiers to shelter behind barricades like (as he put it) ""Aunt Sallies"" while being stoned, as he perceived the local troops had been doing, but instead to go aggressively after rioters, as he and his soldiers had been doing in Belfast.  ""What Colonel Wilford failed to appreciate, or regarded as of little consequence, was that his soldiers… would almost certainly be unable to identify anyone as a rioter.""  Col Wilford was exonerated by the Widgery tribunal and six months after the event he was awarded the Order of the British Empire by the Queen.  The Saville inquiry found that one soldier, Lance Corporal F killed Patrick Doherty, Michael Kelly, Bernard McGuigan and possibly also William McKinney and James Wray.  The report says: ""Lance Corporal F did not fire in a state of fear or panic. We are sure that he fired either in the belief that no-one in the area into which he fired was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or not caring whether or not anyone there was posing such a threat.""  Other soldiers who definitely killed were R, G, U. In other cases it is too difficult to work out who exactly was responsible.  ""With the exception of Private T [and another soldier in one specific incident], none of the firing by the soldiers of Support Company was aimed at people posing a threat of causing death or serious injury.""  ""We have concluded, for the reasons we give, that apart from Private T many of these soldiers have knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing.""  In early 1972, the general was commander of land forces and increasingly concerned that the army had no control over a large part of Derry. He wanted to see rioters dealt with swifty.  The inquiry learnt of the existence of a memo, written by Sir Robert in January 1972, in which he suggested shooting (but not killing) some of the ringleaders of the rioting, known as the ""Derry Young Hooligans"". In the general's mind the army was ""virtually incapable"" against these gangs, because they operated under the cover of snipers.  Lord Saville's report said the panel were ""surprised"" that the general should have seriously considered such a plan and did not believe it had been adopted.  But the inquiry said he could not be criticised for deploying soldiers to arrest rioters, although he had probably sent the wrong unit.  ""In our view his decision to use 1 PARA as the arrest force is open to criticism, on the ground that 1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists in Londonderry.  ""However, there is to our minds a significant difference between the risk of soldiers using excessive physical violence when dispersing crowds or trying to arrest rioters and the risk that they would use lethal weapons without justification.""  The inquiry concluded the general had no reason to expect the tragedy that then unfolded. It accepted his denial in evidence that he sent 1 Para in to provoke republican gunmen to confront them in the street.  Brigadier MacLellan had the power to launch arrest operations against rioters during the day - and the inquiry accepted that he delayed launching that plan until he believed there was sufficient separation between their targets and the marchers.  Saville concluded he had no reason to believe that lives were at stake if the team led by Colonel Wilford went in. The inquiry said that his proposed arrest operation did not include storming the Bogside.  ""We have concluded that Brigadier MacLellan does not bear any responsibility for the deaths and injuries from the unjustifiable firing by soldiers on Bloody Sunday.""  Saville exonerates Major Ted Loden, the commander in charge of soldiers following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Families said the major could have stopped the soldiers from firing.  The report says that events moved so fast ""after the soldiers disembarked in the Bogside that Major Loden had no idea what was actually going on; he assumed that his soldiers had come under attack from republican paramilitaries and were responding.  ""At the time the casualties were being sustained, Major Loden neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat.""  General Sir Mike Jackson, the former head of the British Army, was a Parachute Regiment captain on the day and the second in command of 1 Para.  In the aftermath of the shootings, he wrote up what became known as the ""Loden List of Engagements"".  This was a brief account of what soldiers had told Major Loden about why they had fired. Sir Mike told the inquiry that the list was simply an operational record of shots fired - not an investigative document. He had simply transcribed what he had been told.  Families said that the document was an attempt to conceal the truth by presenting each victim as a bomber or gunman. The list was referred to by senior officers in press briefings in the hours after the killings.  Saville said that the circumstances under which the list was compiled were ""far from ideal"".  But the report added: ""We accept Captain Jackson's evidence of the purpose for which the list was initially prepared; and find nothing sinister in the fact that it did not include details such as the names of the soldiers and the number of rounds fired.  ""However, the list did play a role in the Army's explanations of what occurred on the day."""
197,"Manchester United showed there is life after David Beckham with an impressive victory over Celtic in the opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States.  Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ryan Giggs, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and debutant David Bellion each scored to give the Premiership champions an ideal result in their first appearance since Beckham left for Real Madrid.  ""Celtic made it difficult but there was a good energy about us and our finishing was terrific. The goals were marvellous,"" said United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.  Ferguson was also full of praise for Bellion.  ""For any young lad of 20 to make his debut and score is exciting.  ""I hope he develops - he has quite a bit to learn but he has good enthusiasm.  ""He's lightning quick, his control is good but he has to develop parts of his game.  ""You want a competitive element through the club and have so many players competing for a first-team place.  ""There are no guarantees at Manchester United. If you perform well it gives me the decision of what to do with the team.""  In front of a record 66,772 crowd at Seattle's Seahawks Stadium, Van Nistelrooy began the rout in typically deadly fashion.  He received a seventh-minute pass from Solskjaer before firing a left-footed shot past Celtic keeper Magnus Hedman.  United captain Roy Keane brought down Stilian Petrov in the area after 18 minutes but Alan Thompson missed the penalty for the Scottish side before United took complete control.  Dutch forward Van Nistelrooy turned provider for Giggs for United's second on 29 minutes.  Solskjaer - filling in well for Beckham on the right flank - then swept home a right foot shot to give United a 3-0 lead six minutes before half-time.  Keane was replaced by Juan Sebastian Veron at the interval as both teams began to introduce their substitutes, and United lacked their earlier sharpness until Paul Scholes and Bellion came on.  Scholes fed his new team-mate and, despite looking offside, the former Sunderland player slotted home from an acute angle with 18 minutes remaining."
198,"The number of people out of work and claiming benefit has risen above one million for the first time since the 1930s.  There were angry demonstrations in the House of Commons when the jobless total was confirmed as 1,023,583.  The Speaker was forced to suspend the sitting for 10 minutes for order to be restored after the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, was greeted with prolonged abuse and catcalls from the Labour benches.  Mr Heath said he ""deeply deplored"" the level of unemployment.  Employment Secretary Robert Carr has promised to ""wage all-out war"" against the problems of inflation and boom and bust economics which have contributed to the jobless total.  Measures to increase employment were announced by Chancellor Anthony Barber on 23 November 1971. They included bringing forward some capital expenditure by the nationalised industries, as well as government departments. Mr Carr was asked for his reaction to the latest unemployment figures. ""I am not alarmed, but I am very worried,"" he said. ""I had hoped I would never see unemployment reach this level and our measures are going to take longer to have an affect than I hoped."" Many of the redundancies have been due to companies restructuring to make themselves more efficient. British Steel has announced nearly 1,300 job losses - with the closure of three plants including Newport in Gwent - this month. The Port of London Authority has announced 2,000 dock workers' jobs are to go - that is 800 up on earlier estimates. GEC has announced 1,600 job losses spread across the country. ICI has announced 350 jobs are to go at the Wilton Terylene fibre plant on Teesside. In December, it forecast some 800 jobs would go this year at the nearby Billingham plant."
199,"Taliban leader Mullah Omar died two years ago in Pakistan, a spokesman for Afghanistan's security services says.  Abdul Hassib Seddiqi told the BBC's Afghan Service that Mullah Omar had died of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan.  Afghanistan's government says information on his death is ""credible"".  The latest reports of Mullah Omar's death are being taken more seriously than previous such reports. The Taliban are expected to issue a statement soon.  Sources at the Taliban's two main councils in Quetta and Peshawar in Pakistan told the BBC they were in intensive talks to agree on a replacement for Mullah Omar.  A statement from the office of Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said that it believed, ""based on credible information"", that Mullah Omar died in April 2013 in Pakistan.  The Afghan government, elected last year, has embarked on a peace process with the Taliban. In its statement, the government called on ""all armed opposition groups to seize the opportunity and join the peace process"".  A security official in Pakistan, the country hosting the talks, told AP news agency that the claims of Mullah Omar's death were mere ""speculation"", designed to destabilise the negotiations.  Pakistan has always denied that Mullah Omar was in the country.  The White House says it believes reports of his death are credible.  Lyse Doucet: What is the future for the Taliban?  The Taliban leaders and members of their religious council (shura) have been locked in talks since Tuesday to elect the new supreme leader.  Who they choose is crucial. The selection of his successor will have a big impact on the war and peace in Afghanistan as well as on the future of the Taliban movement itself. The decision will affect the peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.  Mullah Omar's death and the choice of his successor will also have an impact on the unity and cohesiveness of the Taliban.  Mullah Omar was the glue that held the movement together since it was launched in 1994. He had become a mythical figure within the group and was ""religiously"" obeyed by the ranks and files all along.  The selection of a weak person or someone with a questionable legitimacy could result in the fragmentation of the Taliban and possible defections to the Islamic State.  Mullah Omar led the Taliban to victory over rival Afghan militias in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops.  His alliance with al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden prompted the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.  Mullah Omar has since been in hiding, with a $10m (£6.4m) US state department bounty on his head.  Over the years, the Taliban have released several messages purported to be from the fugitive leader.  The latest of these statements, from mid-July, expressed support for the peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.  However, the message was in the form of a text published on a Taliban website, rather than an audio or video recording - fuelling rumours that the leader was dead or incapacitated.  The failure to prove that Mullah Omar was alive was a major factor behind the defection of several senior Taliban commanders to the so-called Islamic State group, according to the BBC's former Kabul correspondent, David Loyn."
200,"While much of Europe has come to adopt baseball, money woes and apathy spell trouble for Team GB. Will it ever fully embrace the US pastime?  After decades as one of America's favourite sports, baseball has expanded its global profile. Now Europe has begun to make its mark on the international game.  But while the prospects for other European baseball teams have brightened, Team GB's have darkened considerably.  Money constraints and public apathy have created conditions that make it unlikely that the team will perform well at next year's European Baseball Championships - and that in turn will lead to more financial woes and even less of a public profile.  Though football now dominates the British sports landscape, baseball was at one time very popular.  Earlier this month, American baseball historian David Block discovered that the first recorded game of ""Bass-Ball"" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.  In 1918, a game between the US Navy and Army at Chelsea FC's Stamford Bridge stadium attracted 38,000 fans, including King George V.  After World War II, however, baseball's popularity in the UK declined, while the game began to gain popularity on the continent.  The presence of American troops in Italy and the Netherlands helped usher in the creation of strong domestic leagues as more and more Europeans came into contact with the national pastime.  Though European teams still trail baseball-mad nations like Japan, South Korea, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Puerto Rico, they have recently begun to put their stamp on the international game.  At the 2013 World Baseball Classic (WBC), the Netherlands took a shocking fourth-place finish, beating Venezuela - the native country of Major League Baseball's reigning Triple Crown winner, Miguel Cabrera - Cuba, and even the United States.  Italy took seventh, but were eliminated only after losing consecutive one-run games to the two eventual finalists: Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.  Team GB, on the other hand, had to watch from home. In last September's qualifying tournament, they were eliminated after being blown out by both Germany and Canada.  It's not totally surprising: Italy and the Netherlands have very well-established professional leagues domestically, which have facilities to match.  Perhaps more importantly, both have plenty of New World connections to bolster their programme. In WBC play, Italy draws heavily from the US Italian-American population; the bulk of the national team is American-born.  The Netherlands have also benefited from the US immigrant community - their manager, Netherlands-born Bert Blyleven, became a Hall of Fame pitcher in Major League Baseball.  They also can pick from talent located in the Dutch Caribbean, specifically Aruba and Curacao, where baseball is popular.  That's not to say that Team GB does not have its own North American flavour. After appearing for Team GB last September, Michael Roth was called up by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim this spring, making him the first pitcher in the national team's history to play Major League Baseball.  But as a native of South Carolina with an English mother, he did not even realise he was eligible to play for Great Britain until British Baseball contacted him last year.  Given the choice between his Major League career and the international game… well, there is no choice, really.  ""Will I ever pitch for [Team GB] again? I wouldn't rule it out at all,"" Roth says. ""But hopefully my career in the US will take off, and I'm busy focusing on that for a while [so that] I'm not allowed to.""  Whereas the Netherlands, Italy and Germany have the infrastructure to support a strong domestic league, Great Britain's top-flight teams will frequently play on fields with temporary outfield fencing and dugouts, and sometimes even without a backstop behind home plate.  It's a tough sell to dig up funding for upgrades.  ""Can you imagine [in America] going to, I don't know, Joe's Pizza Joint and saying 'I'm setting up a cricket team. Do you want to pay for uniforms?'"" says Alan Smith, who served as general manager for Team GB from 2003-10 and has been involved in club baseball in the UK since the late 1970s.  During Smith's tenure, British Baseball could rely on a small amount of funding each year from UK Sport, the high-performance sports agency that oversees domestic development of athletes.  Baseball qualified for this money due to its status as an Olympic sport. With that support, Smith was able to send the national team to tournaments a week in advance to train together and pay their expenses.  Now that baseball is no longer in the Olympics, that money is gone.  To compete this week in Zurich, players were required to contribute almost $1,500 (£1,000) to help the Federation make ends meet.  Indeed, the expense of the trip meant that the team had to wait until Sunday morning to leave for Switzerland, giving them less than 36 hours together before the first pitch of the tournament.  ""It boils down to [money],"" head coach Sam Dempster says. ""It's very expensive [in Switzerland]. We wanted to have a week-long camp in the UK… but we just can't afford to put everybody up.""  When he's not with the national team or coaching at Ontario's Durham College, head coach Dempster is helping to build a youth programme for British Baseball to increase the game's popularity and to develop a domestic base for talent.  Still, according to former national team general manager Jason Greenberg, there are only around 5,000 people who play baseball at any level in Great Britain. In fact, he was somewhat taken aback that he had even been requested for an interview by the BBC.  ""I'm just surprised,"" Greenberg said. ""It's not often that people on this side of the pond get into [baseball].""  ""I do not think baseball in Britain will really progress in any region unless and until the participation level hits a 'tipping point' and becomes self-sustaining in a meaningful way,"" says Stephan Rapaglia, head coach of the national team from 2004-10.  ""How to get to that point is the real question.""  In a temporary reprieve, Great Britain has snatched four wins to start the tournament, guaranteeing them a spot in Saturday's final game, a winner-take-all contest to settle the question of which team is going to Euro 2014.  But not for nothing is baseball called ""a game of inches"". In a one-game playoff, anything can happen.  And should it all go wrong, for Team GB it'll be yet another long, dark winter of low revenue, low investment and low interest to donate to the programme."
201,"Plans to build a wind turbine in east London's Olympic Park site have been scrapped.  The Angel of Leyton, in Eton Manor, was meant to be a symbol of a sustainable Games and help meet 20% of the site's energy needs after they had finished.  The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) said it was ""no longer feasible"" due to new safety rules and design changes.  The Commission for a Sustainable London 2012 said the ODA must meet its carbon emissions targets by alternative means.  The turbine, to be located in the north of the Olympic Park, was a part of the site's legacy plans and expected to provide renewable energy from 2014.  The project was in trouble after the appointed bidder's turbine supplier pulled out, saying it would not be able to comply with the new regulations, introduced this year, which required it to alter the design of the turbine's internal operator lift.  The supplier said the modified design could not be delivered before the 2012 Games.  The ODA said it learnt from industry feedback that the project would not be appropriate at the planned location and there would be limited commercial interest in it.  David Higgins, chief executive of the ODA, said: ""We have carried out an exhaustive process with the industry and suppliers over the last two years to find a viable way of delivering a wind turbine on the Olympic Park site.  ""However, the industry environment has changed and that means the project is no longer feasible.""  He added: ""Our focus is now on researching a number of alternative renewable energy options across the Olympic Park site to help contribute to these targets and complement the other state-of-the art new energy infrastructure we are building.""  Shaun McCarthy, the chairman of the Commission for a Sustainable London 2012 (CSL) - which is the sustainability watchdog for the Games - said: ""The symbolic power of a wind turbine at the park, whilst valuable, does not outweigh the considerations of the optimal use of resources.""  The ODA is now looking at meeting the targets by using solar panels and a biomass gasification unit as sources of renewable energy at the site."
202,"Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso said it was time for a ""post-industrial revolution"" which would see Europe slash greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020.  But political as well as environmental concerns should spur change, he noted.  EU vulnerability as an oil importer was thrown into sharp relief this week when Russia's row with Belarus hit supplies.  This is the first step towards a common energy policy, says the BBC's Europe editor Mark Mardell.  There are three central pillars to the proposed integrated EU energy policy.  In addition to the 20% of all EU energy that should come from renewable power by 2020, 10% of vehicle fuel should come from biofuels, said EU energy chief Andris Piebalgs.  The EU wants to make these targets to be binding for the first time, he said.  It also wants to make sure all new power stations are carbon neutral in 13 years - they should be built in such a way that carbon can be captured and buried - as well as ensuring there is a big increase in renewable power like wind and wave energy.  ""We need new policies to face a new reality - policies which maintain Europe's competitiveness, protect our environment and make our energy supplies more secure,"" said Mr Barroso.  ""Europe must lead the world into a new, or maybe one should say post-industrial revolution - the development of a low-carbon economy.""  Without such investment and energy efficiency measures, the EU report predicts that EU energy imports will rise from 50% of consumption to 65% by 2030, requiring increased reliance on potentially unpredictable sources.  Although energy has been a driving factor of the EU, which was born as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, policy has on the whole remained a national issue.  The EU wants to fully open up the existing energy market to enable half a billion citizens to get their electricity or gas from anywhere else in Europe.  Mr Barroso proposed stopping power generation and power supply being owned by the same company, which is very controversial in France and Germany.  ""We have two points of disagreement with the commission, which are the possible eventual abolition of controlled prices and the question of separating asset ownership by integrated operators,"" AFP cited an official source at the French industry ministry as saying.  Meanwhile the commission's proposal to reduce emissions was lambasted by one environmental pressure group.  ""If the EU is serious about tackling climate change it must make far greater cuts in its carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed 20% cut does not demonstrate any intention to stay below the two degree limit,"" Catherine Pearce, the group's international climate co-ordinator, said.  The package of measures will have to be approved by European governments before it can come into force.  EU leaders will debate the commission's proposals at a summit in March."

The Spanish second division club said the 33-year-old United States captain had joined until June.  Bocanegra had feared that playing for Rangers now that they are in Division Three would harm his chances of being in the USA World Cup squad.  ""It is a strange feeling because I really enjoy it here and I am club captain,"" he said.  ""But this is a deal that benefits both parties.

204,"   New generation of television detector vans hit the streets  TV Licensing today (Tuesday 24 June) launches its new generation of detector van, the 10th to be rolled out in more than 50 years.  The new vans use the most advanced technology available and are the first to be designed with removable TV Licensing branding, designed to make them look like any other white van on the streets.  Vanessa Wood, TV Licensing spokesperson, said: ""These new vans really are a case of 'now you see it, now you don't'.  ""Because we are able to remove the TV Licensing logo, licence evaders won't know we're in the area unless we want them to.  ""50 years ago you could spot the first TV detector vans coming a mile off as the aerial on top was as wide as the van. This is the first time we have used covert vans and they will be only one part of our activities to target licence evaders.""  Last year TV Licensing caught over 440,000 evaders. The technology developed especially for this new generation of vans means that evaders are even more likely to be caught.  Vanessa Wood said: ""The new vans are so powerful they can tell if a TV is in use in as little as 20 seconds. And once the television is detected, the equipment - which works from up to 60 metres away - can pinpoint the actual room that the television set is in.  ""However, the technology is so secret that even the engineers working on different detection systems worked in isolation – not even they know how the other detection methods work.""  For the first time the detector vans will use GPS satellite technology to track down targeted addresses. This will enable TV Licensing to precisely target individual evader homes using up-to-the-minute information from its database of 28 million addresses.  TV detector vans help TV Licensing catch around 1,200 evaders every day. Anyone caught without a licence risks a trip to court and a fine of up to £1,000.  It is illegal to use or install television receiving equipment to receive television programme services if you are not properly licensed.

205,"Andy Goram has made his return to Motherwell as a goalkeeping coach.  The former Rangers and Hibernian goalkeeper spent more than a year between the sticks at Fir Park before winning a short-term move to Manchester United.  Recently, he has swapped football for a cricket career and has been turning out for Uddingston Cricket Club in the Scottish National Premier Division.  Now he is set to take on the role of coaching Motherwell goalkeepers Stevie Woods and Francois Dubourdeau on a part-time basis.  But boss Terry Butcher admits Goram is reluctant to hang up his boots for good and will leave his long-term options open.  He said: ""Andy is joining the club again in terms of being a goalkeeping coach.  Goram takes over the vacant position from another former Rangers keeper, Jim Stewart, who left to join Kilmarnock full-time.  Butcher continued: ""It's good for Motherwell to have him back at the club.  ""It's a part-time position, because he still wants to play again and he has his cricket as well.  ""But he's a character and he's a winner so I'm hoping that he passes on what he has learned."" Goram admitted he was looking forward to returning to his former club, and said he hoped it might lead to a new career. He said: ""It gives me the chance to put the the two keepers through their paces and help them out, and also keep myself fit. ""I have known Stevie Woods since we were together at Hibs and then we met up again at Fir Park a few years ago. ""I was hoping that something would come up playing wise but the phone hasn't rung, so this is a way of keeping myself active and putting something back into the game. Goram added: ""Ideally, I would love a full-time appointment at the club, but things have still to be sorted out at Motherwell so the part-time arrangement will have to do for the moment."" Despite the financial situation at Motherwell - 19 players were made redundant at the end of last season after the club was placed in the hands of the administrators - Butcher is hoping Goram won't be the only new arrival. The Fir Park boss is determined to add to his squad ahead of the new campaign and is confident he can attract a couple of new players to the club in the coming weeks. He added: ""We have one or two irons in the fire and there will definitely be one or two players arriving before the start of the new season."" Another former Rangers player, and team-mate of Goram, Ian Ferguson, trained with the Motherwell squad at Smithycroft on Thursday to keep his fitness level up, but said he won't be signing"
206,"Brisbane, favourites after winning the previous three titles, were leading by a single point at half-time.  But Port Adelaide, only admitted to the AFL in 1997, stormed back to win 17.11 (113) 10.13 (73).  Gavin Wanganeen kicked four goals while Norm Smith medallist Byron Pickett and Toby Thurstans scored three apiece.  ""They were as hard as hell to beat and it's as sweet as hell to beat them,"" said Port Adelaide coach Mark Williams.  The game was one of the most physical finals and featured several confrontations including a long punch-up between Lions full forward Alastair Lynch and Darryl Wakelin in the first quarter.  It was the first Grand Final appearance for Port Adelaide, who had crashed out in the play-offs in the last three seasons.  It was also the first time two teams from outside Melbourne, the birthplace of Australian rules football, had contested the final.  Brisbane were going for their fourth successive title, attempting to match Collingwood's feat from 1927-30."
207,"A report on the BBC TV programme Newsnight showed Israeli experts in northern Iraq, drilling Kurdish militias in shooting techniques.  Kurdish officials have refused to comment on the report and Israel has denied it knows of any involvement.  The revelation is set to cause enormous problems for the Kurds, not only in Iraq but also in the wider region.  Israel is seen as an enemy of Arabs and Muslims, both inside Iraq and elsewhere in Arab and Muslim countries.  Kurdish politicians will most likely come under pressure to explain what their semi-autonomous government has been up to.  Israeli security experts who spoke to the BBC said they could not have worked inside Kurdistan without the knowledge of the Kurdish authorities.  The news will most probably increase tension between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab population, both Sunnis and Shias, reinforcing fears that the Kurds are pursuing a secessionist agenda.  This would be a serious blow to efforts for national reconciliation at a time when hundreds of Iraqis are killed every month in inter-communal violence.  Iraq's neighbours, too, will be outraged.  Iran and Syria, which have long accused the Kurds of allowing the Israelis to operate on Iraqi territory, will most likely demand an explanation from the government in Baghdad.  The Israeli government says it is conducting an investigation into the BBC report because it is against Israeli law to export military know-how without prior permission.  The BBC report will be like the smoking gun the Arab media has spent years looking for.  Ever since the US-led invasion of Iraq began over three years ago, Arab journalists have been speaking of Israelis operating inside the autonomous region of Kurdistan.  They said this was evidence that toppling Saddam Hussein was only the first chapter in a wider American-Israeli conspiracy to eliminate threats to their strategic interests and re-draw the map of the Middle East.  Syria and Iran, which have common borders with Kurdish areas, are believed to be the primary target."
208,"The Periodic Table will be one element longer Discovered 13 years ago, and officially added to the periodic table just weeks ago, element 112 finally has a name. It will be called ""copernicium"", with the symbol Cn, in honour of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus deduced that the planets revolved around the Sun, and finally refuted the belief that the Earth was the centre of the Universe. The team of scientists who discovered the element chose the name to honour the man who ""changed our world view"". The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) will officially endorse the new element's name in six months' time in order to give the scientific community ""time to discuss the suggestion"". Scientists from the Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany, led by Professor Sigurd Hofmann, discovered copernicium in fusion experiments in 1996. ""After IUPAC officially recognised our discovery, we agreed on proposing the name (because) we would like to honour an outstanding scientist,"" said Professor Hofmann. Copernicus was born 1473 in Torun, Poland. His finding that the planets circle the sun underpins much of modern science. It was pivotal for the discovery of gravity, and led to the conclusion that the stars are incredibly far away and that the Universe is inconceivably large. Under IUPAC rules, the team were not allowed to name the element after a living person. But when asked if, rules aside, he would have liked to have ""hofmanium"" added to the periodic table, Professor Hofmann told BBC News: ""No, I think copernicium sounds much better.""     "
209,"The stainless steel bollard came loose from the Star Clipper on 2 May 2004 at St Katharine's Pier in London and hit a woman waiting to board.  It had been repaired on 9 April, according to a report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB).  The report said the repair work ""failed catastrophically"".  After working loose from the vessel the bollard catapulted over a 1.1 metre-high safety fence.  The woman was waiting with her husband and about 30 other people when she was hit.  She was given first aid by other passengers and by the crew of a harbour services launch but died later in hospital.  The investigation into the incident found that the mooring bollard fitted on the Star Clipper was not part of the original build specification.  The MAIB said the one that failed on 2 May ""had evolved empirically through a series of modifications in reaction to earlier, less catastrophic, failures"".  It said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency had not been informed of the failures and was not consulted on subsequent modifications.  The MAIB recommended that procedures were tightened to ensure that similar incidents did not occur."
210,"The managing director of Durham Tees Valley Airport says that the work on the A66 at Long Newton will boost the airport's own development plans.  The Highways Agency plan will improve a junction with a poor safety record and includes new link to the airport's main access road.  Work is due to start in spring and completed by autumn next year.  Hugh Lang, the airport's managing director, said: ""Obviously the most important benefit of this scheme is that it will make things a lot safer for local people and everyone who uses the A66, including people travelling to and from the airport.  ""From our point of view, high quality transport links are vital to all our plans for developing the full potential of our whole site."""
211,"Lindy Chamberlain has been found guilty of the murder of her nine-week-old daughter after a jury dismissed her claim that a dingo took the baby.  The court was told that she cut the baby's throat and disposing of the body whilst at a campsite near Ayers Rock.  Mrs Chamberlain, who is expecting her fourth child, will now start her mandatory life term with hard labour after being sentenced in Melbourne, Australia.  Her husband, Michael Chamberlain, was found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of baby Azaria, but has not yet been sentenced.  Azaria Chamberlain went missing from the campsite in 1980. Her body has never been recovered but her bloodstained clothes were found and formed the main part of the investigation.  In an earlier inquest the judge accepted the Chamberlains' claim that a dingo had taken their baby but further investigations by British pathologists showed the wounds, indicated by bloodstains on the baby's clothes, could not have been caused by a dingo and a second investigation was started.  Australian experts disagreed with the findings and claimed that assertions Azaria's throat had been cut were completely unfounded. During the seven-week trial the jurors were taken to the Ayers Rock site. Among questions raised was the possibility that a dingo's jaw would not be strong enough to carry off a baby. The case has taken the country by storm and become known as ""Australia's murder trial of the century"". It was expected to end with an acquittal and it is thought that there will now be an appeal. Barrister John Bryson said: ""An appeal is the most expected phenomenon""."
212,"Five NHS hospital trusts in the south of England have been designated as major trauma centres to treat the most severely injured patients.  The trusts, in Plymouth, north Bristol, Oxford, Southampton and Brighton will have consultants available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The new system is for patients with complex or multiple injuries.  Patients will be taken to one of the centres if it is in within a 45-minute ambulance drive.  If it is not possible to get to a major trauma centre in that time, or if a patient need to be stabilised quickly, they will be taken to the nearest hospital with a local trauma unit for immediate treatment.  The hospitals involved are Derriford in Plymouth, Frenchay and Southmead in Bristol, John Radcliffe in Oxford, Southampton General and the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.  The new major trauma centres are part of an England-wide network of 22 currently being set up.  The first four hospitals were designated in London two years ago.  Two of them, St George's in Tooting and King's College in Denmark Hill, are the major trauma centres for patients in Surrey, Kent and Medway.  A report by the National Audit Office in 2010 suggested the centres could save an extra 450 to 600 lives in England every year.  ""Trauma patients will have better access to highly-skilled and experienced trauma clinicians and the most advanced treatments in the world,"" said Dr James Mapstone, clinical director of acute care for NHS South of England.  ""A huge amount of work has gone into developing this new model of care.  ""All the ambulance services in the south have carried out enhanced training of their staff so they can take major trauma patients straight to the nearest major trauma centre.  ""I am confident that having the highest level of expertise, experience and equipment in one place will help us save more lives."""
213,"The money is being split into 16 grants for science teams across the world - with the aim that they work more collaboratively on new approaches.  All the recipients have had to agree to share their findings - even if they had been working on competing projects.  More than 40 million people are believed to be infected with HIV/Aids.  While dozens of different potential vaccines have been trialled in the 25 years since the HIV virus was first identified, scientists have struggled to develop an effective vaccine.  This is because of the virus's ability to mutate and attack the human immune system - the very thing that vaccines try and stimulate to ward off infections.  ""Unfortunately, developing an effective HIV vaccine has proven to be tremendously difficult, and despite the committed efforts of many researchers around the world, progress simply has not been fast enough,"" said Dr Nicholas Hellmann, of the Gates Foundation's HIV, TB and reproductive health programme.  He said the aim of the grant funding is to identify the most innovative approaches in vaccine research and then direct future efforts towards those ideas.  The 16 grants are being divided between 165 investigators in 19 countries - some of whom are well-known in the area of HIV/Aids research and some who are lesser known.  One of the projects being funded is research to isolate a large number of antibodies from humans and animals, including llamas, to see if they can neutralise HIV.  Another project will try to use viruses related to smallpox as potential vaccines.  The researchers will be expected to share their findings and compare their results with others to ensure a more coordinated approach to scientific research.  This is the foundation's largest-ever investment in HIV and Aids research, Dr Helmann said.  The foundation says it is also developing global access plans to ensure that any discoveries from the research are accessible and affordable in developing countries."
214,"The government has identified eight sites in England and Wales as suitable for future nuclear power stations while ruling out a further three.  Energy Secretary Chris Huhne said Dungeness in Kent and both Braystones and Kirksanton in Cumbria were not suitable for environmental reasons.  While nuclear had a key role to play, he hoped half of all new capacity by 2025 would come from renewables.  But he ruled out plans for a tidal energy scheme on the Severn estuary.  Funding a Severn barrage with public money would be ""very costly"", he said, and as finding private investment would be challenging, other options should be pursued.  The last Labour government approved eleven locations as suitable for new nuclear plants by 2025 - most on the site of existing plants - but this has been cut to eight as part of a revised draft policy statement presented to Parliament on Monday.  The possible locations are: Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex; Hartlepool; Heysham, Lancashire; Hinkley Point, Somerset; Oldbury, Gloucestershire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Sizewell, Suffolk and Wylfa on the Isle of Anglesey.  The BBC's Environmental Analyst Roger Harrabin said this did not mean the projects - which would be subject to planning permission - would go ahead as Mr Huhne has insisted there would be no public subsidies available for them.  Nuclear power is a potential flashpoint within the coalition government with many leading Lib Dems sceptical about the merits of a new generation of nuclear plants and the Conservatives more enthusiastic. Roger Harrabin said the definition of what constituted a subsidy was likely to be fought over in the coming months.  Critics say the UK is at risk of an energy crisis by the middle of the next decade when many of the existing nuclear plants will reach the end of their lives.  Mr Huhne said the country needed a diverse energy mix with contributions from all sectors but with more emphasis on renewables such as wind power.  ""I'm fed up with the stand-off between advocates of renewables and of nuclear which means we have neither,"" he said.  ""We urgently need investment in new and diverse energy sources to power the UK. We'll need renewables, new nuclear, fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage and the cables to hook them all up to the National Grid as a large slice of our current generating capacity shuts down.""  Many Lib Dem MPs have traditionally been opposed to further nuclear expansion but Mr Huhne told the BBC the issue was not a ""toxic"" one among his colleagues.  A majority of MPs in Parliament - including most Conservatives and Labour members - are in favour of building more nuclear plants and Mr Huhne said the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition agreement had made it ""very clear"" nuclear would be included in the country's future energy mix.  ""A deal is a deal. I am there to deliver it,"" he said.  The list of potential sites is confined to England and Wales as the Scottish government has said it is opposed to future nuclear expansion.  Environmental campaigners Greenpeace said the economics of nuclear power ""simply did not add up"".  ""Lib Dem voters backed a party that supported renewable energy, opposed taxpayer handouts to the nuclear industry and supported full democratic engagement in the planning process,"" said Jim Footner, head of its climate and energy campaign.  ""And local democracy is being kicked out of the door when it comes to nuclear sites. Lib Dem supporters must be furious that local communities will have little say about nuclear power stations in their area, other than choosing the colour of the gates.  ""The Liberal Democrats need to stay true to their supporters by dropping the costly distraction of nuclear power and start investing in the clean, renewable and efficient technologies that will tackle climate change and provide tens of thousands of new British jobs."""
215,"Much of the UK fell silent at the stroke of 1100 GMT, as people remembered those killed or injured in the two world wars and other conflicts.  The ceremony was even more poignant than usual, marking the last Remembrance Day of a century which saw millions of British and Commonwealth soldiers give up their lives in action.  The silence was observed at airports, railway stations, supermarkets and banks, with veterans' association the Royal British Legion estimating as many as 85% of the adult population - 50 million people - observed the silence this year.  The Duke of Kent accompanied the 99-year-old great-grandmother to the service outside Westminster Abbey.  She laid a cross in memory of Britain's war dead at the service, which she has missed only once since the Second World War.  Elsewhere in central London, on Horse Guards, the Last Post was sounded by Lance Corporal Steven Perry of the Welsh Guards.  Prime Minister Tony Blair left a Cabinet meeting in Downing Street to join veterans for the two minute silence at the Cenotaph, in nearby Whitehall.  Mr Blair will be unable to attend Sunday's official Cenotaph ceremony as he will be in South Africa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.  The Prince of Wales will lead other members of the Royal Family in Sunday's Cenotaph wreath-laying ceremony, as the Queen is also in South Africa.  The Queen and prime minister will attend a remembrance ceremony in Durban.  The Queen marked Remembrance Day on Thursday by observing a minute's silence in South Africa.  The Queen was in Alexandra, near Johannesburg, at 11am South African time - 0900 GMT.  This is the fifth year in which the legion has campaigned for the silence on 11 November and it has the backing of the three main political parties and organisations around the country.  Passengers travelling on BA flights were asked to join cabin crew in a two-minute silence to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.  Railtrack staff observed the silence at all main line railway stations, with passengers invited to join in.  London Transport staff and passengers marked the silence at Underground stations, though tubes could not stop for safety reasons. Many London buses pulled into the side of the road for the two minutes.  The start and finish of the silence was announced at supermarket and superstore outlets.  Among those observing the silence were Tesco, B&Q, Argos, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway, the Post Office, Body Shop, Boots and Next.  Many radio and television stations also fell silent, while admission to the Imperial War Museums in London and Duxford, Cambridgeshire, is free on Thursday.  Ian Townsend, the British Legion's secretary general, said: ""People in all walks of life all over the country have welcomed this simple form of remembrance. It introduces a poignant annual moment into their lives."""

Deputy Hilario has failed to keep a clean sheet in Cech's absence."
217,"   British computer hacker Gary McKinnon's fight against extradition to the US has drawn support from a large and diverse range of influential people. How did his case become such a cause celebre? It has to be one of the most unlikely partnerships in the history of popular music - one is a toned and tanned boy band singer, the other a brooding and balding lead guitarist from one of the rock giants of the 1970s. But it's not music that has brought Boyzone's Keith Duffy and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour together - it's the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon. Mr McKinnon has become Britain's best-known conspiracy theorist, or, as London Mayor Boris Johnson put it - he's a ""classic British nut job"" who believes in ""little green men"". The American authorities see it differently. The 43-year-old is a wanted man in the US, where he has been accused of ""the biggest military computer hack of all time"". For the past five years he has been fighting an extradition request from the American authorities which want to try him on US soil. If convicted there he faces up to 60 years in prison. Along the way he has amassed a legion of supporters, as diverse in their make up as they are distinguished in their own fields of achievement. They include novelist Nick Hornby, film critic Barry Norman, Emma Noble, the ex-glamour model and former daughter-in-law of John Major, Sting, his film producer wife Trudie Styler and actress Julie Christie. Politicians of all hues have also leapt on Mr McKinnon's case. And pop stars Chrissie Hynde and Sir Bob Geldof have teamed up with Gilmour to record a song of support. In the past six weeks his cause has been further bolstered by a high-profile campaign in the Daily Mail newspaper. But how did Mr McKinnon's fight become such a rallying cause for this disparate group of supporters? Mr McKinnon does not deny he hacked into Pentagon systems, but claims he was searching for evidence of a UFO cover-up. His story started back in 2002 and the media have, periodically, followed the twists and turns of his legal battles (see graph, below).    There was also a spike in coverage when he was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome - a form of autism - last year, but the campaign to stop his extradition has gathered pace, passion and people in the last six months. While a PR agency has taken on some of the work, Mr McKinnon's campaign has won support for a variety of reasons. Author Nick Hornby, Emma Noble and Keith Duffy are thought to have taken an interest because they have children with autism. For others, it raises serious questions about freedom and rights. Former Beirut hostage Terry Waite learned of the campaign from friends. ""[Mr McKinnon's] a young man who's vulnerable, who may well have breached the law but in this case, the law has to be exercised with common sense and compassion."" It changed from the geek in his bedroom to the great American military machine trying to remove this person from the bosom of his mother    He is one of many supporters concerned about what he called the ""inadequate and unfair"" extradition treaty between the UK and the US. As it stands, the UK requires the US to show only ""reasonable suspicion"" to secure the extradition of a British citizen. But the US asks for ""probable cause"" from the UK. Mark Kelly, keyboard player with British rock group Marillion, became interested in the story a couple of years ago. He shares, with Mr McKinnon, a love of computers. ""It was one of those stories that caught my eye. I have always had a fascination with computers and I can see how he got caught up in looking for evidence of UFOs and with his Asperger's, it probably became a bit of an obsession."" But when Kelly put a petition on the band's website it irritated many American fans - an indication of how opinion about the case is divided. While most of the celebrities seem to have come on board of their own accords, author Jilly Cooper admits to the BBC she supports the case ""in principle"" but knows little about it. She says she was contacted by a newspaper ""early in the morning"". There is no doubt the McKinnon camp received a major boost when the Daily Mail made the campaign its own about six weeks ago. The paper declared the case was an ""affront to British justice"" and ""in the name of both sanity and compassion"" urged Home Secretary Alan Johnson to ""think again"". Since then it has included updates almost every day. Public relations consultant Mark Borkowski believes the Mail's backing has been crucial, calling it the ""oxygen"" the campaign needed. And the timing was right, as the ""modern day soap opera"" reaches its finale. ""It changed from the geek in his bedroom to the great American military machine trying to remove this person from the bosom of his mother."" And while the story appeals to mothers in Middle England, the Mail's readership base, it also reaches out to the future online audience, he says. But for Max Clifford, a fellow PR expert, the paper's motivation has been chiefly political, another ""stick for the Daily Mail to beat the government"". And it's no surprise to discover there is some PR professionalism in the campaign. London-based PR agency Bell Yard is working ""pro bono"" (free) for the McKinnon campaign. It has experience in this field, having represented the ""NatWest 3"" - three British bankers who were eventually extradited to the US on fraud related charges. The agency was unavailable for comment for this story. But it is Mr McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, who is the key player. She says her son's case is another example of how the government is failing to protect its own. A musician and author, Ms Sharp is so well versed in the extradition laws she sounds like a lawyer. She has been plugging away for years - never turning down an interview, responding to all e-mails and now tweeting about her son's dilemma on Twitter. And she hasn't passed up on the benefits of old style networking - which helps explain how the pop star support got rolling. Ms Sharp is friends with David Gilmour's brother-in-law and she says the guitarist got involved because he has always supported mental health charities. She re-wrote the lyrics of folk classic Chicago, which Gilmour, Sir Bob Geldof and Chrissie Hynde put their voices to - it was the campaign's first plea to US President Barack Obama. Ms Sharp said the couple have been a huge support and she is constantly amazed by what people have done for the family. ""I am really shy and find it incredibly hard to deal with the media attention but I have to make sure Gary stays here. ""So many good things have happened but the worry is always there.""     "
218,"Geologists have discovered that a huge canyon in Iceland was created by just a few days of catastrophic flooding, separated by thousands of years.  The Jokulsargljufur canyon, 28km long and up to 100m deep, is home to Europe's most powerful waterfall.  By analysing the chemistry of rocks in the canyon's walls, the researchers constructed a timeline of how the canyon was shaped over time.  Most changes seem to have taken place during three brief but brutal periods.  Interestingly, these key flooding events occurred two, five and nine thousand years ago - separated by millennia of relative stability.  Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the scientists say their findings demonstrate the importance of brief but cataclysmic events in shaping landscapes.  ""We think of natural environments as being formed over thousands of years, but sometimes they are shaped very suddenly,"" said Edwin Baynes, a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh and the paper's first author.  ""This insight into one of Iceland's magnificent landscapes helps us better understand these processes, and illustrates their legacy.""  To build their erosion timeline, Mr Baynes and his colleagues used the fact that atoms on the earth's surface are bombarded by cosmic rays. The concentration of resulting ""cosmogenic isotopes"" found in a rock surface allows geologists to calculate how long that rock has been exposed to the atmosphere.  This dating process pointed to a series of tumultuous floods in the canyon's history, triggered by the volcanoes that lurk beneath Iceland's largest ice sheet. Eruptions from these volcanoes would have released vast amounts of water from glaciers.  If the resulting flow of water in Jokulsargljufur canyon was above a certain threshold, it would start to topple and transport huge columns of basalt rock - originally formed by cooling lava.  These columns are the structure underlying several large waterfalls in the canyon, including the mighty 54m Dettifoss.  In the rare, destructive floods described by the study, those basalt walls were eaten away so rapidly that the waterfalls were forced upstream by up to 2km - retreating at a startling rate of hundreds of metres within days.  The researchers say their findings underline the importance of considering such rapid change when studying not only landscapes on earth, but also those of other planets."
219,"Police said the grenade was thrown at the mayor, Badruddin Ahmed Karman, just after he inaugurated a local badminton tournament on Friday evening.  Mr Kamran, a senior figure in the opposition Awami League, was taken to a safe place.  He later told the BBC that it was an attempt to kill him.  Hundreds of protestors took to the streets, changing anti-government slogans.  In August 2004 Mr Kamran escaped a similar attack which killed one local opposition politician.  In May 2004, the British High Commissioner to Dhaka, Anwar Chowdhury was also the target of a grenade attack in Sylhet town.  He was injured, but later recovered."
220,"Craig Levein's departure from his post as Scotland coach comes as a surprise to no-one.  Indeed, with a record of only three wins from 12 competitive games, perhaps the only surprise is that it took the Scottish Football Association until now to decide that Levein's time was up.  His appointment almost three years ago was largely welcomed within the Scottish football world.  The same might be said of his exit.  Ultimately, Levein had run out of plausible defences for a growing list of failings on his watch.  Though he retained the public support of his players, vast swathes of the Tartan Army had grown weary of his inability to produce on-field performances to match his positive and optimistic pronouncements.  In fact, since the friendly victory over the Czech Republic in his opening game in charge, it is difficult to recall a moment that could be described as a genuine highlight of his tenure.  His second game was an unimpressive 3-0 defeat in Sweden, but it is on competitive results he has been judged and, in that regard, he has come up sadly short.  A humdrum goalless draw in Lithuania signalled the beginning of the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, followed four days later by an excruciating encounter with Liechtenstein, a nation ranked 100 places lower than Scotland.  That ended in a 2-1 victory, courtesy of a goal six minutes into injury time.  However, it was the subsequent match - away to the Czech Republic - that began to turn public opinion against Levein.  His decision to experiment with a 4-6-0 formation proved futile, with the Czechs winning 1-0 and the coach responding to criticism by refusing to accept that he might have got things wrong, a trait that was to re-emerge.  Strangely, as Scotland lost again - this time 3-2 at home to the world and European champions Spain - they came as close to achieving a creditable performance and result as they did throughout Levein's reign.  His side clawed back a two-goal deficit with a highly creditable second-half performance, only for Stephen McManus - the goalscorer against Liechtenstein - to gift a winner to the Spaniards.  There was then an 11-month hiatus between qualifiers, during which time there were hints of better things to come with friendly wins over the Faroe Islands, Northern Ireland, Wales and Denmark, interspersed with defeats by Brazil and the Republic of Ireland.  Also, crucially, striker Steven Fletcher let it be known that he did not wish to be considered for selection, having been overlooked for the matches against the Czech Republic and Spain.  That led to a lengthy stand-off, which only ended last month when the player and Levein put their differences behind them - too late, as it transpired, to save the manager.  Any hopes the Scots had of reaching the Euro 2012 play-offs were effectively ended when the campaign resumed in September 2011.  Needing a victory at home to the Czechs, the Scots led twice, but a late and controversial penalty decision went against them and they emerged with just a point.  Subsequent wins over Lithuania and Liechtenstein were effectively meaningless, as was the final defeat in Spain.  Despite the failure to reach the play-offs, Levein spoke of improvement and stated that Scotland were capable of winning all of their qualifying matches in a World Cup group that featured Belgium, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia and Wales.  Alas, that prophecy was to come back to haunt him as dour home draws were garnered against the Serbs and Macedonia, with accusations of overly cautious tactics again levelled at the manager.  So, when he brought back Fletcher and another cause celebre of the media and fans - Kris Commons - for the double-header away to Wales and Belgium, it looked like a last roll of the dice by a hitherto intransigent character.  Both players featured in both matches, but neither was able to prevent the team losing in Cardiff and then in Brussels, as the qualifying campaign stuttered further.  Chief executive Stewart Regan and the Scottish FA board refused to come to a knee-jerk decision but after days of discussions arrived at what results suggest was the only logical conclusion.  Levein has been closely involved in the SFA's attempt to overhaul Scottish football from top to bottom.  While this project may yet prove to be a fruitful one in the long term, Levein's primary task was to return success in the short term, something he was unable to do.

221,"They say it is a victory for the rights of ordinary Bangladeshis.  On Wednesday the government lifted restrictions on former Prime Ministers and bitter rivals, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina.  The restrictions were part of sweeping measures the government said were needed to fight corruption.  Sheikh Hasina, the leader of the Awami League was no longer banned from returning from abroad, a government statement said.  ""My gratitude to the people of Bangladesh, the world media, world leaders and the friends of Bangladesh. Everybody put pressure on the government, and because of that pressure they have withdrawn the ban,"" she told the BBC's World Today programme.  The government also said there were no restrictions on the movements of Khaleda Zia, head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who has been held under virtual house arrest in Dhaka.  She has reportedly been under pressure to go into exile in Saudi Arabia.  ""It's a people's victory,"" the BNP's Hannan Shah said, Reuters news agency reports.  The Awami League's general secretary, Abdul Jalil said: ""It has been reasserted that people's democratic and fundamental rights cannot be robbed.""  The interim government's U-turn has also been broadly welcomed in the press.  Wednesday's statement said that the government's efforts to stop Sheikh Hasina from returning to Bangladesh were being lifted ""in view of the views expressed in the media and different quarters"".  Sheikh Hasina was prevented from flying back to Dhaka on Sunday.  She still faces murder charges after Awami League members allegedly killed members of a rival political party during protests in Dhaka last year against the caretaker government prior to the imposition of a state of emergency.  The statement made no reference to comments by the US State Department earlier on Wednesday that democracy in Bangladesh was under threat.  ""If the caretaker government does not take right decisions, there is a real threat to Bangladesh democracy and nobody wants to see that,"" spokesman Sean McCormack said.  The government's statement went on to say that - contrary to media reports - there had never been any pressure on Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia to leave the country, and there were no restrictions on her freedom of movement.  It is not clear whether Wednesday's announcement means that the two women will be free to resume their political careers and take part in elections which the government says will be held as soon as corruption in the country has been eradicated.  Khaleda Zia's family said last week that they had been told to prepare for imminent exile in Saudi Arabia, but the Saudi Arabian government reportedly declined to allow her into the kingdom - apparently because it was reluctant to take in an unwilling guest.  Attempts by the government to find another country for her to be exiled seem to have failed.  Khaleda Zia's son, Tareque Rahman, is one of around 160 politicians, businessmen and civil servants who have been arrested by the military-backed caretaker government on corruption charges.  The drive against corruption seems to have been welcomed by many ordinary Bangladeshis tired of seeing politicians and their relatives siphoning off the country's wealth.  The BBC's John Sudworth in Dhaka says that after days of political manoeuvring with the intention of sending the country's two most powerful political leaders into exile, the emergency government has seemingly backed down.  He says that the government seems to have badly misjudged the mood of the people.  It has argued that reform of the political system would be impossible while the two former prime ministers are still on the scene.  Our correspondent says the two women seem to have won this particular battle with the government - which is perhaps a sign of just how much political clout they still wield."
222,"Knopfler was riding a Honda motorbike when he was involved in a collision with a Fiat Punto car on Monday.  The 53-year-old singer and guitarist suffered a broken collar bone and six broken ribs in the accident which happened in London's smart Belgravia district in mid-morning traffic.  A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: ""Police were called by a member of the public at 10.49am yesterday to reports of a road traffic collision in Grosvenor Road, London SW1, near the junction with Claverton Street.  ""It is believed a red Fiat Punto motor car was in collision with a Honda motorcycle.""  Knopfler was taken by ambulance to St Thomas' Hospital in central London where he was treated for his injuries.  A hospital spokesman said he was in a stable condition and had been discharged from the hospital by 6pm.  The car's female driver was unhurt in the crash, police said.  Knopfler enjoyed a string of hits with 1980s group Dire Straits including Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing.  The band is probably best known for its album Brothers in Arms, which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide.  Knopfler has also written the soundtrack to five films, including The Princess Bride and Local Hero.  He is due to begin a European concert tour in April.  Other celebrities who have suffered recent motorcycle crashes include Liam Neeson, who suffered a broken pelvis after crashing into a deer near his New York state home in July 2000.  Keanu Reeves nearly died after falling off his motorbike in 1997. He spent several weeks on crutches."
223,"The striker had hit out at Rijkaard after he claimed Eto'o had refused to play as a substitute against Racing Santander on Sunday.  But sporting director Txiki Begiristain said the situation has been resolved.  ""Rijkaard has asked us not to sanction him because he has confidence in the team's ability to manage itself,"" Begiristain told sports daily Marca.  ""He is happy that everything has been resolved so quickly. The problem has been one of dialogue from the moment last weekend's game with Racing ended.""  Eto'o had apparently slammed Rijkaard for saying he refused to play as a substitute.  ""Telling a news conference I didn't want to play is the behaviour of a bad person,"" Eto'o said.  ""I have always thought about the group first. That is what hurt me most.""  Eto'o, a three-time African Player of the Year, has only just returned from a four-month absence following a serious right knee injury.  He explained that he refused to play in the 2-0 win over Racing Santander even though he turned out the previous weekend in the 0-0 draw against Osasuna because he did not have time to warm up properly.  Ronaldinho was also critical of Eto'o after the game, suggesting the striker had been inconsiderate to his team-mates.  But Eto'o responded: ""If a team-mate says that you must think of the team, it's up to him to think of the team. Personally I always think first about the group and then money.""  However, on Wednesday Eto'o sought to quell tensions raised by his public criticism.  During a training session there appeared to be no hard feelings between Eto'o and Ronaldinho as the two players were photographed hugging.  Earlier, Eto'o denied calling Rijkaard ""a bad person"" saying: ""It's a lie to say I called Rijkaard a bad person. Those who love controversy want to say that,"" he said.  ""I didn't explode, I responded to what was being said about me,"" he added.  Reports had suggested a rift had developed at the Catalan club between supporters of president Joan Laporta and those of former vice-president Sandro Rosell, who left the club after a disagreement with Laporta."
224,"David Low is acclaimed as the 20th Century's greatest cartoonist, the man who scarred the appeasers with his pen, but the public is only now getting to see the originals of his work.  Low's most famous creation, that reactionary caricature Colonel Blimp, entered the dictionary as another lasting legacy of a master satirist.  Now Parliament's Westminster Hall - at the heart of what was once the office of many of Low's victims - is the stage for a major exhibition of his work and the history it depicts.  The exhibition, sponsored by the Political Cartoon Society and BBC History Magazine, opens on Thursday and runs until the end of October. Entry is free.  Tony Banks, chairman of the House of Commons Committee on Works of Art, said Low was a prime example of how cartoonists could be both true artists and significant political commentators.  ""He was exposing the evils of fascism and Nazism when people around this place - and in the newspapers - were ignorant of their menace,"" Mr Banks told BBC News Online.  The Labour MP is himself an avid collector of political cartoons and is bequeathing his collection to Parliament when he dies.  ""It is right we recognise the pivotal position of the cartoonist in politics,"" said Mr Banks.  Wonderful portraits of politicians often did not tell as much as cartoons about the personalities and the political history involved, he argued.  Parliament has contributed some of the cartoons for the exhibition but has hundreds more by other artists, such as James Gillray and John Doyle.  Mr Banks hopes Parliament in future can house that collection in a new museum of political cartoons inside the Palace of Westminster.  Whatever politicans said about being lampooned, they hated it much more when they were not drawn, he added.  Many of Low's most famous works are featured in the exhibition, which aims to portray 40 years of British history through his cartoons.  Among them All Behind You, Winston depicts Churchill's new wartime coalition government in 1940.  And there is the equally famous Very Well Alone - showing Britain fighting on against Germany after France's surrender.  That cartoon is also signed by Churchill, who sent it to the air chief marshal in charge of coastal defence during the Battle of Britain.  There is cutting commentary too of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement stance.  Greg Neale, editor of BBC History Magazine, stressed Low had also brought lesser known issues such as racial prejudice and calls for African independence to public attention.  He argued Low, and other cartoonists, had not only been able to encapsulate the mood of the nation at key periods, but also shape public opinion too.  Born in New Zealand and working in Australia before arriving in Britain in 1919, Low had an outsider's perspective on the UK.  Colonel Blimp was intended to portray all he disliked in British politics - extreme isolationism, impatience with common people and their concerns, and little enthusiasm of democracy.  The character emerged after Low overheard two military men sweating in a Turkish bath talking about how cavalry officers should be able to wear their spurs inside tanks.  Tim Benson, the exhibition's curator, said most of the original cartoons belonged to private collectors and were going on public show for the first time.  The history teacher added: ""Cartoons are a wonderful way of learning about the past."""
225,"The money will come out of BT's cash resources.  Cellnet is the UK's second largest mobile telephone operator with over five million customers. Vodafone is the market leader, with Orange and One-2-One the runner-ups.  BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield said: ""Following the success of our partnership with Securicor, BT is pleased to have the opportunity to increase its investment in the UK mobile telephony market at this exciting time.""  He said the acquisition would leave BT ""well-placed to capitalise on the opportunities presented by Second and Third Generation Mobile technology in the highly competitive UK mobile market.""  Securicor shareholders can now expect a direct payment, while the deal effectively creates a new Securicor group whose shares will be distributed to the company's existing shareholders.  BT has long wanted to fully own its mobile service, as it has watched rivals grab market share and launch innovative marketing schemes.  But it has previously been inhibited by the fear of regulatory disapproval. In April the government lifted the ban.  It is rebranding the service BT Cellnet, and will offer combined wire telephone and mobile service accounts.  Although Securicor was not able to gain as much as it might have from a sale on the open market, the sale gives the company a massive return on its original investment of just £4m in Cellnet in 1983.  The UK mobile phone industry is expanding rapidly, with the introduction of pay-as-you-talk schemes adding customers.  Over 1 million customers acquired mobile phones in the last three months alone, and 17m are now in use in the UK, representing one-quarter of the population.  But Cellnet has lagged behind its rival Vodafone in expanding internationally. Vodafone became the world's biggest mobile phone company when it acquired Airtouch earlier in the year.  The announcement of a new generation of mobile phone licences, which will allow data and Internet transmission, is a crucial stage in the future development of the sector.  The price of mobile calls has also fallen sharply, and continuing investigations by the regulator Oftel is likely to ensure that trend continues."
226,"Mismanagement of the scheme, designed to benefit working parents on low incomes, had ""caused hardship or distress"" to some, Mr Blair conceded.  One-third of claimants were overpaid and pushed into poverty when asked to repay, Citizens Advice reported.  And the Parliamentary Ombudsman accused Paymaster General Dawn Primarolo of not giving MPs a clear picture.  Both reports call for overpayments to be written off.  In an emergency statement to MPs, Ms Primarolo said the government was already writing off overpayments which are attributable to a department error.  She said that she had asked HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to suspend the recovery of overpayments where there is a dispute between the HMRC and the tax credit claimant.  CAB's damning report - based on 150,000 cases handled by the charity, which runs the Citizens Advice Bureaux - said that HMRC had ""failed to live up to its own standards of information, clarity and efficiency of service"" in the administration of tax credits.  One of the chief gripes reported to the CAB was overpayment, which topped £500 in more than half the cases.  The Office for National Statistics recently reported that of £13.5bn paid out last year, £1.9bn consisted of overpayments. CAB said the ""huge overpayments"" were due to HMRC system failings.  The charity called on the government to give an amnesty to people who had received tax credit overpayments, instead of trying to claim them back.  Meanwhile, in her report, Parliamentary Ombudsman Ann Abraham accused Ms Primarolo of failing to give accurate information when questioned about overpayments in the House of Commons in February.  Ms Abraham also said she was unable to say how many overpayments were due to government mistakes and how many were down to delays in claimants reporting a change in circumstances.  But her report echoed CAB's call for an amnesty on the recovery of overpayments, particularly those caused by official errors in the first two years of the scheme.  ""This would be a sensible and proportionate response to the situation and would give much-needed relief to people who, in many cases, have been caused considerable distress and hardship,"" she added.  Ms Primarolo said the system, which has benefited more than six million families and 10 million children, was not in ""complete collapse"".  She stressed she had been clear about the extent of the problems. ""Before that date and since that date I have continued to acknowledge that there were problems...I have made it clear in parliament that there are issues with the IT system and the administrative system,"" she said.  The Shadow Conservative Chancellor, George Osborne, called on Ms Primarolo to appear before the House of Commons to explain the handling of tax credit overpayments.  ""It is a scandalous that a system meant to help people is causing so much hardship and distress, to the point where people are having to borrow money from loan sharks to repay money sent to them in error,"" Mr Osborne said.  David Laws, the Liberal Democrat Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said that the reports showed that the design of the system was ""flawed.""  Mr Laws added that the call to write off overpayments was ""sensible and logical""."
227,"I grew up in Wiltshire all too aware of the Ministry of Defence's major presence in the county, especially on Salisbury Plain.  We all knew that there were top secret establishments, including one where spooks and boffins researched mysterious and deadly weapons of germ warfare. That was Porton Down.  But the thought of getting anywhere near, let alone inside, never crossed anyone's mind.  Porton Down has long since been split into two establishments; one Ministry of Defence, the other civilian.  The latter is now on the front line of the effort to detect and minimise the risk of Ebola appearing in the UK. I was given rare and exclusive access to the site, run by Public Health England.  Known as PHE Porton, the centre carries out research on infectious diseases, and works with the private sector and universities on new products such as vaccines.  Crucially, given international concern about Ebola, Porton has a key role in response to potential emergencies.  This is where tests on suspected Ebola cases are carried out. Diagnostic services are provided for clinicians across the UK.  Porton Down has known all about Ebola since it was identified in 1976.  A closely guarded sample of the virus was brought to the UK to be examined and to allow further research.  But a potentially fatal mistake was made by a Porton scientist who accidentally came into contact with the virus in a laboratory.  He developed severe fever symptoms but survived after being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in North London (which has the facilities to treat any patients developing Ebola from the current outbreak).  That Ebola sample has remained at Porton ever since - in tightly controlled conditions.  It is part of a deadly collection which includes anthrax and plague. They are stored at temperatures as low as minus 80C (176F).  I was assured that the freezer units which contained these killer samples were behind several secure doors, each requiring access codes.  The corridors of Porton seem anonymous and little changed since the 1950s.  Only the occasional sign saying ""novel and dangerous pathogens"" and ""emergency showers"" betrayed the nature of the work being carried out. There is a brisk and businesslike atmosphere with no sense of panic or crisis.  The message from Porton is that Ebola is just one of a number of threats which are being monitored.  Officials have long been used to dealing with several samples every week, particularly at this time of year with many long-distance travellers arriving in the UK.  Doctors contact the Imported Fever Service run by Public Health England with details of cases needing further examination. Samples are then dispatched to Porton.  Lassa fever, yellow fever and dengue are high on the list of diseases which Porton is looking out for.  A testing process lasting about seven hours will look for traces of these and other viruses as well as Ebola.  There has been a threefold increase in the number of cases referred to Porton since Ebola gained a national media profile as clinicians take an ultra cautious approach.  So far no Ebola case has been identified in the UK.  Dr Tim Brooks, who heads up Porton's work on rare and imported pathogens, told me that he and his colleagues were not unduly concerned about Ebola because dealing with dangerous diseases was part of day-to-day life.  He said they were well practised in testing routines and how to handle positive cases.  In July this year the Porton team dealt with a case of the infectious and potentially deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.  A British traveller was said to have responded well to treatment. A patient who arrived in the UK with the fever in 2012 subsequently died.  Here on the site surrounded by woodland in the Wiltshire countryside, nobody is taking anything for granted.  But there is a sense that they are ready for anything and that they are well prepared should Ebola arrive in the UK."
228,"Shots taken by amateurs could become part of Getty's stock archive Flickr's 40 million registered users are being given the chance to make money out of their snaps. For two years, Getty Images has tapped into more than 100,000 photos taken by professional and semi-pro photographers who post on the site. Now the doors are being opened to all Flickr users as Getty takes advantage of a library of four billion pictures. ""Flickr users are the eyes of the world,"" Douglas Alexander, Flickr's general manager, told BBC news. ""We have contributors from over 100 countries and images are coming in from every corner of the globe. This deal broadens the horizons and the global marketplace for commercial photography and gives our users the chance to make some money."" Neither Getty nor Flickr were forthcoming about actual rates saying they vary from job to job but are industry standard. It is generally thought the average rate for an image is between $150-$240 (£100-£160). The agreement extends one that has been in place for the last year with photo library Getty. Under that deal, Getty built up its stock or archive photography base with pictures taken by pros or semi-pros posting on Flickr. These were then sold on to the firm's commercial clients and photographers were paid the industry commission rate when their images were used. Getty's chief operating officer Nick Evans-Lombe said Flickr had been a great resource and inspiration. ""One of the great benefits of the Flickr collection is that it is truly eclectic and has this fantastic broad reach across the globe."" Hal Bergman has managed to turn a hobby into a job Mr Evans-Lombe said the strength and diversity of what Flickr could offer was apparent during one call for photographs portraying the concept of families. ""We got over 17,000 pictures back from around the world very quickly. That gave us a very broad and deep illustration of the concepts to do with family and will resonate in countries around the world. ""In the past, one of the criticisms of the stock photography market is that it has been a mostly North American and European aesthetically dominated industry."" Mr Evans-Lombe also said another great asset of the collection was that it was ""more gritty"" because the photographs are not shot for commercial services and therefore have more authenticity. ""The extension of this partnership is a testament to the talent of our Flickr community and we want to provide a platform for our members so they can get their work out there to the largest possible audience,"" said Mr Alexander. Hal Bergman dreamt for years of turning his passion from a side-line into a full-time career. He started posting his photos on Flickr in 2006 and said this partnership has been a fruitful one for him. ""I have been doing this for six years on the side and a year and a half ago I gave up my day job in website development."" And while staying mum about how much he actually earns, Mr Bergman told BBC News he makes a good living from photography. ""I am working as a freelance and getting a lot of commission work and I would say this deal brings in about a third of my income which is pretty good when you consider I have 200 images on the Getty site and a further 2,500 on another site."" This week he has been shooting photos at a frat house in Los Angeles and a Hollywood party. Mr Bergman said while he is managing to get himself established, he is concerned about how the opening up of this partnership will affect him. ""This deal helped me get my foot in the door with Getty, something I had been trying to do for years. And while I am concerned about opening up the floodgates, I am going to take it as a challenge. But I am really not worried because I like to think I am good at what I do,"" said Mr Bergman. Users wanting to take part in the project will be asked to opt-in to the scheme.     "
229,"He was speaking after military commanders were said to be worried that the prince might draw enemy fire and put other troops at risk.  Mr Reid, speaking in Afghanistan, said Harry should be allowed to carry out normal duties ""as far as is possible"".  The prince's unit, the Household Cavalry's Blues and Royals, is due to be sent to Iraq next year.  Prince Harry is adamant that, if his soldiers go, he wants to be there too.  Speaking last year, he said: ""If they said 'no, you can't go front line' then I wouldn't drag my sorry ass through Sandhurst and I wouldn't be where I am now.  ""The last thing I want to do is have my soldiers away to Iraq or wherever like that and for me to be held back home.""  But it is understood some military commanders feel a royal presence in this already volatile region could increase the dangers for British troops.  Mr Reid said the prince's profile must be taken into account but that he should be allowed to carry out his duties.  ""It would be my wish to do that as far as is possible, but obviously if there are aspects because of his prominence, that he has not sought, that would lead to a threat dimension that would be taken into account by commanding officers,"" he said.  ""That is for them to judge but my plea would be to let this young man... be treated as what he is and that's a potentially very good young officer.""  A Clarence House spokesman also admitted that, in some circumstances, Prince Harry's presence could pose an increased risk to his regiment but said a ""judgement call"" would have to be made by his commanding officer.  Defence analyst Amyas Godfrey, of the Royal United Services Institute, said he thought the dangers of the prince serving in a battle zone had been overstated.  ""It would be an enormous amount of resources to kidnap one British soldier or to specifically attack that one specific soldier, and in many ways that would be counter-productive for an insurgency,"" he said."
230,"The Scarborough Ward was shut at the start of the month to help East Lincolnshire Primary Care Trust reduce a £7m overspend.  Health managers have promised patient care will not suffer and the ward will re-open in April.  Eileen Verhoven, who joined the march on Saturday, said the campaign to reopen the ward is gathering momentum.  The East Lincolnshire PCT said it is looking again at whether it can legally accept money from East Lindsey District Council to keep the ward open.  The authority made the offer of cash but the trust turned it down.  All 26 staff on the ward will be redeployed as community nurses while it is shut."
231,"Rights group Human Rights Watch has urged India to hold an independent inquiry into the unmarked graves found in Indian-administered Kashmir.  Earlier, the state human right commission said it had evidence that 2,156 bodies had been buried in 40 graves over the last 20 years.  The commission is the first government body to confirm what others have previously alleged.  Its report is yet to be submitted but it has been widely leaked in the media.  The commission's investigation focused on four northern, mountainous districts and involved scrutinising police, mosque and graveyard records, interviewing police and local people and cross-referencing information.  ""For years, Kashmiris have been lamenting their lost loved ones, their pleas ignored or dismissed as the government and army claimed that they had gone to Pakistan to become militants,"" Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.  ""But these graves suggest the possibility of mass murder. The authorities should immediately investigate each and every death.""  Independent human rights groups have long insisted that thousands of people have mysteriously disappeared over the last two decades and never been accounted for.  Some have accused India's security forces of abducting local people, killing them and covering up the crime by describing the dead as unknown militants when they are given for burial.  The security forces say the unidentified dead are militants who may have originally come from outside India.  They also say that many of the missing people have crossed into Pakistan-administered Kashmir to engage in militancy."
232,"Sweden's royal family has rejected allegations of links between the German-born queen's late father and the Nazi regime in Germany.  Queen Silvia has published a report she commissioned in response to claims her father took over a factory from a Jewish businessman.  The report concluded that Walter Sommerlath had in fact helped the Jewish man escape from Germany.  But a Holocaust survivors' group said the findings were a ""whitewash"".  Last year, Swedish commercial broadcaster TV4 reported that Mr Sommerlath had taken advantage of the Nazi's ""Aryanisation"" programme to take over a factory belonging to Jewish businessman Efim Wechsler in 1939.  But the new, 34-page report, compiled by Swedish World War II expert Erik Norberg, indicated that Mr Sommerlath had allowed Mr Wechsler to escape from Germany by trading the factory for a coffee plantation in Brazil.  The report confirmed that Mr Sommerlath - who died in 1990 - had gone to Brazil in 1920, aged 20, where he met and married the queen's Brazilian mother Alice, whose family owned the large plantation.  The American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants reacted to the report by dismissing it as ""self-serving"" and lacking in credibility.  ""The report was not an independent inquiry - it was commissioned by the queen with the participation of her cousin, a Brazilian lawyer,"" the organisation said in a statement quoted by the Associated Press news agency.  ""Such a probe can only raise suspicions of a whitewash.""  Queen Silvia has faced criticism in Swedish media for a number of years for not doing more to address the rumours of her father's role in Germany during World War II."
233,"Thousands of dead fish have been found in the River Weaver in Cheshire.  The Environment Agency was notified of ""fish in distress"" near Winsford by anglers on Saturday.  Tests showed low oxygen levels in the water, so environmental officers have been pumping oxygen into the river.  Tom Thornett from the Environment Agency, which is investigating the matter, said: ""Potential causes could be naturally occurring algae that is known to starve water of oxygen.""  Mr Thornett added: ""Oxygen levels have been restored significantly and we are in the process of carrying out ongoing tests to identify what caused the oxygen levels in the water to drop.  ""Hydrogen peroxide is used to increase oxygen levels in the water and, in this case, may have created a build-up of foam because of reaction with small traces of detergent found in the water.  ""Although this might look unpleasant, it does not pose a risk to health or the environment.""  Six species of fish including bream, roach, silverfish, carp, tench and perch have been affected.  Steve Beech, of Winsford And District Angling Association, said: ""The impact long term will be many years, tens of thousands of fish we cannot replace overnight."
234,"An Israeli report says that 75% of them cannot write Hebrew, and nearly half cannot hold a simple conversation in the lauguage.  The report, commissioned by Israel's Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, says that the unemployment rate among the Ethiopian community in Israel is at least three times the national average.  More than 1,000 families are still living in the caravans in the reception centres where they were placed on arrival in Israel, and 45% of parents cannot pay for their children's schooling, the report said.  However, the military is one area of Israeli life where Ethiopian Jews are making a positive impact, with nearly all young Ethiopian males doing national service and more than 50 Ethiopians having been made officers, the report said.  Ethiopia's Jews first captured the attention of the world in the 1980s, when a series of airlifts transported almost an entire population from their famine-stricken birthplace - the majority of them in two vast operations:  And in 1991, Operation Solomon flew 20,000 Jews to Israel from Ethiopia itself.  A further airlift began in June this year, aimed at transporting the last 3,000 members of the Quara Jewish community from north-eastern Ethiopia to Israel.  Members of the 18,000-strong Felash Mura community are also seeking to emigrate, but are not recognised as Jewish by the Israeli authorities.  Unlike Russian immigrants, many of whom arrive with job skills, the Ethiopians came from a subsistence economy and were ill-prepared to work in an industrialised country.  And some immigrants who had spent years as refugees found it hard to adapt to life as independent citizens once again."
235,"After three days of speeches, the Cuban National Assembly has voted to amend the country's constitution, making its socialist system of government untouchable.  ""A return to the past is undesirable, unthinkable and impossible for our people. The revolution is invincible,"" Vice-President Carlos Lage told the assembly.  The vote came at the end of two weeks in which nine million Cubans took to the streets and 99% of voters signed a petition in support of the amendment.  It was called by President Fidel Castro in response to what he perceived to be attacks from George W Bush.  The US president made a speech last month in which he called on Cuba to make democratic reforms.  Over the course of the three days, more than 160 Cuban deputies, schoolchildren, leaders of social groups and soldiers addressed the National Assembly.  They all said much the same thing - that Cuba was a sovereign state that would not bow to pressure from the United States.  The speaker of the parliament, Ricardo Alarcon, accused Washington of trying to suffocate Cuban society with its 40-year trade embargo and travel ban against the island.  ""Cuba will never return to capitalism,"" he said.  The last words were spoken by Mr Castro, who in two long speeches laid out the achievements made during his 43 years in office - in health, education and sport.  Cubans would defend themselves with everything, including their lives, he said, but would never sacrifice their dignity or sovereignty.  ""The revolutionary process of socialism cannot be reversed,"" he said.  Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said the measure was also necessary to protect the current system after the Mr Castro and his brother and appointed successor die - a rare public reference to their mortality.  ""The key here is what we will do when the generation that carried out the Revolution and commands it today, the generation of Fidel and of Raul, is no longer with us.  ""The key is not to be disarmed of our ideas,"" said Mr Roque, who at 37 is among the youngest of the government officials.  No mention was made in any of the speeches about a petition that dissidents handed to the National Assembly last month calling for greater civil liberties.  Schools, factories and offices were closed during the three-day session so workers could watch the speeches on national television.  The figures, which no one disputes, seem to indicate overwhelming support for President Castro and his socialist system.  The BBC's Daniel Schweimler in Havana says opposition in Cuba has been stifled and many said they felt pressured into signing the petition.  Some experts said that by approving the amendment President Castro may have made the biggest mistake of his political career.  ""Paradoxically, by trying to mummify the Cuban constitution, the government may actually be declaring it irrelevant,"" Robert Pastor, a former official in the Carter administration, told the Miami Herald newspaper.  ""If it says this constitution is beyond reproach, you will have to start with another constitution.""  Our correspondent says only the most committed sincerely believe that 99% of Cubans support Mr Castro's government, but it is clear that 99% do not feel they can oppose him either."
236,"Police are investigating a ""network of corrupt officials"" as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption, a media inquiry has heard.  Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers told the Leveson Inquiry evidence suggested a ""culture of illegal payments"" at the Sun newspaper.  She said payments allegedly made by the Sun were authorised at a senior level.  This part of the inquiry is looking at the relationship between press and police in the light of the hacking row.  Ex-Scotland Yard senior officer Brian Paddick and former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott also gave evidence.  Earlier, the inquiry was told that the then Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was briefed by police about their investigation into phone hacking in 2006.  But counsel to the inquiry, Robert Jay QC, saidpolice told her it was not planning to extend its phone-hacking inquiry to include News of the World staffother than Clive Goodman, the reporter jailed with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2007 for illegally accessing royal aides' voicemails.  DAC Akers told the inquiry that evidence suggested that the Sun often made payments to relatives or friends of sources and that one of those arrested allegedly acted as such a conduit.  The payments being investigated were not ones that ""just involve the odd drink or meal,"" she said. They were ""regular, frequent and sometimes significant sums of money to public officials"".  Payments by journalists to public officials were identified in the ""police, military, health and government"", she said.  DAC Akers said there was some evidence of officials being put on retainers.  Over a number of years, £80,000 was paid to one individual, she said, while one journalist received £150,000 from the paper to pay sources.  ""Emails indicate that payments to sources were openly referred to at the Sun,"" DAC Akers said.  In herwritten statement, DAC Akers said there was recognition that this behaviour was illegal, with reference made to staff ""risking losing their pensions or job"", to the need for ""care"" and to the need for ""cash payments"".  DAC Akers said the vast majority of stories stemming from such payments appeared to have constituted ""salacious gossip"" rather than being in the public interest.  News Corporation chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch later issued a statement insisting the practices were ""ones of the past, and no longer exist at the Sun"".  Lord Prescott, who received a £40,000 settlement over phone hacking, was asked about the relationship between the press and News International, owner of the Sun.  He told the inquiry: ""I always thought it was wrong that politicians at the highest level were too close to Murdoch. There is always a price.  ""It's not exactly corruption and I'm not accusing them of that... I thought it gave a corrupting influence that they had too much influence and power.""  He told the inquiry of the reluctance by the Met Police to investigate phone hacking. He was told by police in 2009, after the Guardian newspaper reported the practice was widespread at the NoW, there was no evidence he had been targeted.  Detectives questioned Mulcaire about the hacking of his agent Joan Hammell in 2006, he said, but it was not until February 2011 that police told him 44 messages from him on her phone may have been intercepted, he said.  The Labour peer praised DAC Akers's inquiry, but said he was concerned police ""withheld the truth"" over the extent of phone hacking.  ""I think there is a conspiracy of silence to hide the facts and frankly I am stronger of that view in the last few months,"" he said.  Last year Lord Prescott and Mr Paddick successfully argued at a judicial review that the Metropolitan Police failed to notify them about potential hacking.  Mr Paddick, who retired from the force as Deputy Assistant Commissioner in 2007, told the inquiry that analysis of Mulcaire's computer revealed the private investigator had details about people in the police's witness protection programme, including the killers of toddler James Bulger.  ""For this information to be in the hands of Mulcaire, and by implication potentially in the hands of the News of the World, it's clearly worrying,"" he said.  He said it was difficult to see how people could have ""complete confidence"" in the phone-hacking investigation.  It might be ""better for the public perception if these matters were investigated by an outside force,"" he said.  He went on: ""There are thousands of honest decent police officers who like me are horrified by the sort of conduct that Sue Akers was talking about this morning.  ""A lot of junior officers feel very let down by their senior officers.""  Opening Monday's hearing, Lord Justice Leveson paid tribute to reporter Marie Colvin, who died during shelling in the Syrian city of Homs on 22 February.  Lord Justice Leveson said Ms Colvin's death had underlined ""the need to preserve free speech and free press"".  In his opening statement, Mr Jay said relations between News International and the Metropolitan Police were at best ""inappropriately close"".  The nature of their relationship, he said, might explain why police did not properly investigate phone hacking in 2006, or later in 2009 and 2010.  Neil Garnham QC, representing the Metropolitan Police Service, told the inquiry the decision not to put more resources into the original phone-hacking investigation had been reasonable ""because as serious as the interception of telephone calls is, it is not a matter of life and liberty"".  The Leveson Inquiry has two parts, the first of which is examining relations between the press, politicians and police, and the conduct of each.  The second part will look at the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International and other media organisations."
237,"Jonathan began his media career as a researcher on the Channel 4 chat show Loose Talk. Various other documentaries and shows followed before he began working on Soul Train. It was whilst working on the show that he met researcher Alan Marke and the pair came up with the idea of The Last Resort and their own production company.      In 1987 Channel X was born. Finding themselves short of a satisfactory host Jonathan stepped in, literally as 'the last resort', and made his television presenting debut in January 1987. The show was a hit and broke the mould of the traditional TV chat show in this country; as a result, Channel 4 commissioned a total of four series.     Jonathan's radio career began in 1987 when he filled in for Janice Long on Radio 1 for two weeks. He then went on to host a flagship show on Richard Branson's first radio station, Radio (the fore-runner to Virgin Radio) in 1988. Jonathan was also a regular contributor on Radio 4's Loose Ends from 1987 to 1989. In 1998 he teamed up with Chris Evans to host a flagship show for the new-look Virgin Radio, The Jonathan Ross Show.     Jonathan's prolific television career as a presenter has included: The Incredibly Strange Film Show (1988-1989); One Hour with Jonathan Ross (1990); For One Week Only (1991); Tonight With Jonathan Ross; Saturday Zoo; Gag Tag (with Frank Skinner); Mondo Rosso; The Late Jonathan Ross (1996); In Search Of... ; The Big Big Talent Show. In 1991 and subsequent years Jonathan has compered the British Comedy Awards.     In 1999 Jonathan became Barry Norman's successor to the BBC One flagship film show. He now hosts his own chat show on BBC1 and the game show It's Only TV... But I Like It.     In May 2003 Jonathan picked up two Sony Awards for his work in the radio industry. He won best entertainment presenter and the special 2002 award for achievements over the year.     In March 2005, and for the second year running, Jonathan was awarded the prestigious Television and Radio Industries Club awards for Best Radio/Digital Radio Personality of the Year. Even the likes of Nicky Campbell and Jeremy Vine were not enough to unperch him.     In June 2005, Jonathan became Jonathan Ross OBE and was voted the most powerful man in broadcasting. Something he denies so obviously we must all agree with him.      Jonathan lives in North London with his wife Jane Goldman, their three children and a menagerie of pets including a dog, cat, iguana, two salamanders, 2 chinchillas and a number of ferrets - he hopes to get a fruit bat soon.

When Wigan Casino first opened its doors in 1973 it was the original venue for those young things who didn't fit in with the mainstream.A generation who didn't relate to soft rock and pretty boy pop, whose desire to dance all night to obscure American soul music pushed them as far underground as the local miners. It enjoyed a brief fling with the media in the late seventies and then disappeared again,maintained by the faithful until its final demise in 1983 but the legend lives on and revived by the current advertising trend for nostalgia its 30th anniversary this weekend is being broadcast live on Radio 2 and courted by everyone from the tabloid press to international tv! So if you want to catch the real Northern Soul experience, ditch all those dodgy pretender nights and check out one of the celebration events. But not until you've listened to the man responsible for it all - Casino founder Russ Winstanley.Click here Russ remains a Northern Soul man and hosts a show on BBC GMR every Saturday lunchtime playing classic oldies and Motown.   But if that's not enough to satisfy your lust for all things soulful then here's our guide to Northern in a nutshell! Northern Soul was a phrase coined by journalist Dave Godin back in the early 70s to describe the phenomenon of young white soul enthusiasts who wanted to dance all night to obscure sixties soul music.   Its longevity is based on the passion of its fans and the obsession with finding that 'elusive' rare record!  Dancing plays a major part in the scene but if you can't shake your thang don't worry 'cos original and individual style is positively encouraged.  Clothes and appearance are important, scruffy gits won't feel at home nor will people who've had one too many shandys - the bar shuts early!   Most Northern Soul punters are wary of mainstream media interest but accept that to keep the scene alive they need to attract new blood. Things not to ask about Northern Soul -    ""Scuse me mr DJ do you play any of those tunes on the new Woolies compilation?   ""Is everybody over thirty five in here?""   ""Do you still go to Wigan?""

239,"The spinner, 35, bowled England's Paul Collingwood in the first Test in Kandy to claim his 709th Test victim.  Muralitharan reached the mark in his 116th Test - 29 fewer than Warne - and has conceded only 21.77 runs per wicket compared to the Australian's 25.41.  He was four behind Warne before the series began but took his fifth wicket of the match to claim the record.  England kept Muralitharan at bay during his first spell of the third morning but he struck immediately in his second, bowling Collingwood from around the wicket.  It was in front of his home crowd and they went wild as firecrackers were set off to mark the moment of history.  Muralitharan was hugged by his team-mates, with his proud wife and son watching from the stands.  It was a huge moment in cricket, and a vivid contrast from Sri Lanka's November Test tour of Australia, where Muralitharan took 4-400 in a 2-0 series defeat.  He said: ""It's my hometown, my parents are here, my wife is here... all the relatives are here and all my schoolfriends.  ""Everybody is here. It's a bigger moment than if I had taken it in Australia, it's the right time I think. It's not easy to take six wickets in an innings, I managed to let my pressure off now.""  And he admitted his record-taking ball had not spun as he had wanted it too.  ""I tried to spin the ball and it went the other way, but that's a special wicket,"" Muralitharan said.  He ended the first innings with 6-55 - 710 Test wickets.  The feat marked a new high in the 15-year career of one of the most celebrated bowlers of the modern game, whose controversial bent-arm action has been questioned in the past by umpires.  Muralitharan had held the record before when he surpassed West Indies' Courtney Walsh's 519 wickets in 2004.  But he suffered a shoulder injury later that year and was then overtaken by Warne.  Muralitharan holds several other records in Test cricket including the most five-wicket hauls (61) and 10-wicket hauls (20).  He said his 1998 performance at The Oval against England, when he took 16 wickets, was his career highlight.  ""Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn't look back from there.  ""I like to be a bowler because I can't bat properly. After 17 years of cricket I have got the opportunities and made the wickets fall."""
240,"He is currently the managing director of the Barbican in London, which he described as ""a unique and wonderful arts centre"" upon his appointment in February.  Sir Nicholas, born on 23 February 1951, worked for the English Bach Festival and the BBC's music department before establishing himself as a journalist at the end of the 1970s.  He was a music critic for US magazine The New Yorker and British newspapers The Times and The Observer.  And he worked as an adviser to London's South Bank Centre, earning a Royal Philaharmonic Society award for its Mozart Now festival in 1991.  He took charge of Radio 3 in 1992, a high-profile year for classical music radio in the UK owing to the launch of national commercial station Classic FM.  While Classic FM took a ""greatest hits"" approach to the genre, gaining a bigger audience than its more established rival, Radio 3 continued to offer a high-brow mixture of recorded and session material, concerts and culture.  His responsibilities widened when he became director of the BBC Proms, a job he held until his appointment to the Barbican this year.  He relinquished his role at Radio 3 in 1998 to play an integral part in the BBC's Millennium programming.  And by 2000, Sir Nicholas was the controller not just of the Proms, but also of live events and classical music on TV.  At the Barbican he replaced Sir John Tusa, who retired after 12 years overseeing a venue which has branded itself ""the largest multi-arts centre in Europe"".  Sir Nicholas, who is married with four children, was appointed a CBE in 2001 for his services to music and Millennium broadcasting."
241,"Horse racing has returned to Hereford after a near four-year absence from the National Hunt steeplechasing circuit.  The 245-year-old track was controversially closed by its owner, Arena Racing Company, in December 2012.  That followed a dispute with the local council over its lease, but a decision to reverse the closure was made in January 2016.  Herefordshire champion jump jockey Richard Johnson was due to have five rides on his home track.  But it was the Nicky Henderson-trained odds-on 1/2 favourite, Rather Be, who won the first race, ridden by Andrew Tinkler.  Johnson was fourth in the first race and then had to settle for second in the next, also won by the odds-on favourite, the Paul Nicholls-trained Coillte Lass, ridden by Sam Twiston-Davies.  In front of a crowd of 4,500, Twiston-Davies ended up riding a treble to take him to 68 winners for the season, 13 behind champion jockey Johnson.  In total, 64 horses were confirmed for the seven-race card, although 13 consequently proved to be non-runners.  The first recorded meeting at Hereford was in August 1771, after which there were 241 years of racing until it closed.  ""ARC Racing and course officials could hardly have hoped for better as Hereford Racecourse reopened for business.

He has been away from the series for some months, but the end will come - for good - in February.  He will leave Walford Square because he does not want his family to watch him die.  Mark's death, when it comes, will not be on-screen.  A spokeswoman for the show said: ""There is now nothing more he can do medically to stop the advancement of the infection.  ""Rather than see his family suffer from the deterioration of his health and eventual death, Mark decides to leave Walford to spend his remaining days seeing the world and coming to terms with his fate.""  Mark was diagnosed with HIV several years ago in the soap. He started taking combination therapy in 1997, and is currently on his third course of the treatment.  Carty said: ""Portraying someone with HIV has been very challenging at times but to learn Mark has been inspirational to real-life people with HIV is really humbling.""  He added that in performing the role he had had ""great fun, made some lovely friends and have been very lucky working with terrific scripts and storylines.""  Recently, Mark Fowler married long-suffering Lisa, the former partner of EastEnders' bad boy Phil Mitchell, but left the Square when she returned to Phil.  Todd Carty became a household name in the late 70s when he played 'Tucker' Jenkins in the school series Grange Hill.  Carty has spent most of the last 15 years working on the show. His only major show outside the role was as the narrator of the BBC docu-soap Paddington Green.  In 1983 he starred in the fantasy film Krull."
243,"John Lennon's widow Yoko Ono is marking the 28th anniversary of the musician's death by playing a special memorial concert in Tokyo. The anniversary of Lennon's death prompts quiet reflection in Japan Japan is one country where John Lennon's memory is kept very much alive. Beatlemania has never really died. Every night in Tokyo, bands dressed as John, Paul, George and Ringo faithfully reproduce their sound. Even though many of the musicians would struggle to hold a conversation in English, they know every word of the entire Beatles songbook. Fans of all ages sing along, but only the older generation can remember the momentous occasion when the Beatles performed in Japan. They played Tokyo's Budokan Arena for five nights in the summer of 1966, with each show lasting just thirty minutes. Thirty-five thousand policemen guarded the group from their fans and from nationalist protestors who threatened to disrupt the concerts. They believed a foreign pop group would ""desecrate"" a hall which had been built for judo and other ""noble"" martial arts. In the end, the concerts passed without incident, but Yoko Ono says that later, Lennon looked back on the experience with bemusement. ""The Beatles were a little bit concerned because the people were rather quiet, so they thought maybe the people didn't like it,"" she explains. ""But then the organiser explained that the Japanese are very polite and they do not want to scream and shout - they just want to applaud. ""In those days it was like that, but now, of course, the Japanese fans have learned to be expressive,"" says Ono. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The Beatles' 1966 Tokyo shows were part of a gruelling world tour to promote their records and, of course, to make money. However, they also became unofficial diplomats for Britain - a point noted by the then British ambassador to Tokyo, Michael Stewart. ""In sober truth, no recent event connected with the UK - apart from the sole exception of the British Exhibition of 1965 - has made a comparable impact on Tokyo,"" he wrote in a confidential memo. He also praised the Beatles' skill in handling the Japanese media at a press conference. ""Most commentators accepted them for what indeed they are - agreeable, talented and quick-witted young musicians,"" wrote the ambassador. Junichi Mizusawa, who runs the John Lennon museum in Saitama, says the Beatles received such a warm welcome because they represented the chance for a fresh start. ""We really felt that they were singing for us. They sounded completely different to Japanese music or jazz or American pop, so initially it was rather shocking,"" he explains. ""But young people in the 60s had no problems accepting them because they seemed to be giving voice to our feelings. It was a new sound that excited a generation which had nothing to do with the war."" After he married Ono in 1969, John became a frequent visitor to Japan and even tried to learn the language. He treasured the fact that the Japanese rarely intruded upon him and his family. Since his murder on 8 December 1980, Yoko has worked tirelessly to maintain Lennon's image as a music icon and peace campaigner. Now at the age of 75, she's back in Japan for an anniversary concert at the same venue where the Beatles played their legendary shows. ""Now I'm getting philosophical about it, I think that my ancestors, the spirit of my ancestors, is calling to me saying, 'Yoko, you should come back to Japan once in a while.' So I'm now saying okay."" Ono explains she has always been sensitive to spirits and feels her husband's presence keenly when she is in her home country. ""He loved Japan so much. I don't think it was to do with his wife - well maybe a little bit! It was a new sound that excited a generation which had nothing to do with the war    ""But he liked the sensitivity and the quietness that the Japanese have and the reason is because he was a shy person. ""I'm sure you don't think that he was a shy person but he was, and he related to that I think."" Ono's concert at the Budokan will raise money to build schools in Asia and Africa, and will also feature Japanese artists such as Tortoise Matsumoto and Bonnie Pink. Some fans of John Lennon, though, are choosing to commemorate the 28th anniversary of his death in a more intimate way. Outside the museum in Saitama, visitors place flowers at a memorial bearing the word Imagine. And most take a few moments of silence to remember the man they think of as their closest English friend.     "
244,"The Doctor, Sarah and Harry arrive on a desolate and apparently deserted Earth to discover that a group of shipwrecked astronauts from a human colony, GalSec, have been lured there by a fake distress call. One of their number, Roth, tells Sarah of an alien conducting gruesome experiments on him and his crewmates. The alien turns out to be a Sontaran, Field-Major Styre, who is compiling a report on human physical and mental capabilities as a prelude to an invasion of Earth.  The Doctor challenges Styre to unarmed combat. The Sontaran agrees but is quickly weakened in Earth's unfamiliar gravity. Harry meanwhile enters Styre's ship and uses the Doctor's sonic screwdriver to remove the vital terullian diode bypass transformer, so that when the alien returns there to revitalise himself he is drained of all his energy and destroyed.  The Doctor sends a message to the Sontaran fleet, warning them that without Styre's report they cannot invade.  The alien emerges from its ship and removes its helmet. It is a Sontaran.  The Doctor, Sarah and Harry leave Earth via the transmat with the intention of returning to Nerva.  The Doctor : ""Not me"" [He holds up a piece of metal.] ""Piece of the synestic locking mechanism from Nerva's rocket - popped it in my pocket.""  The Doctor : ""Foresight. You never know when these bits and pieces will come in handy. Never throw anything away, Harry."" [He throws it away.] ""Now, where's my five hundred year diary. I remember jotting some notes on the Sontarans... It's a mistake to clutter one's pockets, Harry.""  The Doctor : ""Horologist, actually, and chronometrist. I just love clocks: atomic clocks, quartz clocks, grandfather clocks... Cuckoo clocks...""  Sarah initially believes Field Major Styre of the Sontaran G3 Military Assessment Survey to be Linx (The Time Warrior). She says that they are identical, which they aren't (Styre's face is paler, squatter, and lacks bristles, and he has five rather than three digits). [As with the tall Sontarans of The Two Doctors, it seems clear that, although a cloned species, a degree of morphological diversity is present. That there is also mental divergence is obvious or else the military ranking system is meaningless.]  The main Sontaran military leadership group is known as the Grand Strategic Council. Styre uses a 'pistol' rather than the typical Sontaran wand. A terrulian diode bypass transformer is a vital part of the 'recharging' equipment used by Sontarans, allowing them to 'feed on pure energy'. Sabotage of this component proves fatal for Styre. The Sontaran robot is also powered by terrulian.  The Doctor thinks that his 500 Year Diary has notes on the Sontarans in it [made, despite partial memory loss, after the events of The Two Doctors?]. The sonic screwdriver is used to repair the transmat spheres and to disable the robot. Mention is made of the vast animal/botanic section on Nerva.  Earth, possibly 'London', in the same period as The Ark in Space.  By the time of The Ark in Space, Earth has been without any form of animal life for around 10,000 years. However, Earth has been habitable for several thousand years. [The solar flares are not those mentioned in 'The Trial of a Time Lord'.] Nerva, 'the lost colony', has never been found, and has become a legend [as it's in Earth orbit it presumably has some stealth capability].  Other Earth colonies, such as Galsec, have established large empires (such peoples are perhaps the regressive elements mentioned by Vira in The Ark in Space). With humans in control of around half of the galaxy, many of the empires have no time for 'Mother Earth' philosophies (cf. Planet of Evil). It is commonly believed that Earth is still uninhabitable.  This was the first story to be recorded with no interior scenes.  Kevin Lindsay makes his last Doctor Who appearances, playing Styre and the Sontaran Marshal. He died not long afterwards as a result of a long-standing heart condition.  The GalSec astronaut Krans is played by Glyn Jones, the writer of the season two story The Space Museum.  Tom Baker broke his collar bone during the making of this story, and he is consequently doubled by Terry Walsh in many of the scenes where the Doctor is required to move or engage in physical action.  Obvious use is made of stand-ins during the fight with Styre.  During the fight the Sontaran's head is knocked sideways.  Why only send one Sontaran? (Numbers are surely not at a premium in a cloned race?)  And why is Styre experimenting on humans prior to an invasion of Earth when the planet is depopulated anyway?  Sarah in her yellow mac and woolly hat? At least it's practical (cf. Jo Grant).  Title Music - Ron Grainer and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, arranged by Delia Derbyshire  'It's absolutely typical of Harry. How anyone in his right mind can fall down a whacking great subsidence like that...' The Sontaran Experiment succeeds despite its obvious limitations.  It has a virtual film look, although neither the robot nor the deflection of the Marshal's invasion plans are wholly convincing. The Sontaran Experiment exposes the padding in many Doctor Who stories by completing its narrative with great economy (cf The Awakening).  'The Sontaran Experiment is an experiment for the show as well as for Field-Major Styre,' reckoned Nick Pegg in DWB No. 93, dated September 1991. 'The first two-parter for over ten years and the first story shot entirely on OB videotape, it comes across in dramatic terms as a series of heavily stylised statements about where the show is headed under the new line-up. Conventions and expectations which had formed the bedrock of the Pertwee years are yanked from beneath the viewer's feet; the emphasis on such standard lines as ""characterisation"" and ""morality"" gives way to what looks like an experiment in pure atmosphere. Untrammelled by the need for complex exposition (because the actual plot is so delightfully nonexistent and silly), the story concentrates on generating a series of effects.'  The idea that a Sontaran battle fleet would hold back from invading a totally uninhabited Earth while a lone Field-Major conducts a lengthy assessment of the ability of humans to withstand an attack is indeed a rather silly one. The revelation that groups of human colonists have 'built an empire' since leaving their planet of origin also sits rather uneasily with the scenario presented in The Ark in Space, in which it was suggested that the sleepers aboard Nerva were the only ones to have survived the solar flares that had supposedly devastated the Earth. These awkwardnesses are neatly glossed over, however, and writers Bob Baker and Dave Martin present a highly entertaining story with just the right amount of plot to fill its unusual two episode length.  It is in terms of atmosphere and imagery that The Sontaran Experiment really triumphs. The tension builds nicely during the first episode with the GalSec crew's hints of an alien menace lurking in the rocks and the ominous sound and eventually sight of an imposing robot patrolling the area, all leading up to the cliffhanger introduction of Styre - initially mistaken by Sarah for The Time Warrior's Linx (although the Sontaran actually looks slightly different on this occasion, with a redesigned mask and five fingers instead of only three). Then in the second episode the story takes on a really horrific quality as the sadistic nature of Styre's tests on his human victims becomes fully apparent. The scene in which Harry finds one of the astronauts left chained up to die of thirst is truly shocking, and the subjection of Sarah to a series of terrifying hallucinations is also, as Pegg put it, 'genuinely sinister' - although perhaps the most gruesome test of all, involving an assessement of human resistance to 'immersion in fluid', is thankfully only heard about rather than seen. The climactic fight scene between the Doctor and Styre is also well done, and the simple but quite effective shot of the Sontaran 'deflating' as the energy drains out of him is another enduring image.  Rodney Bennett makes an excellent debut as a Doctor Who director (The Ark in Space, although the first of his stories to be screened, was actually the second to be made) and the astutely chosen and well used Dartmoor location adds much to the story's atmosphere and effectiveness. It is indeed refreshing to have, for once, a story recorded entirely in the open air.  The Sontaran Experiment is a pleasing interlude between the two more substantial stories either side of it, and is memorable in its own right as an exciting and well-crafted adventure."
245,"Miss Rayner, the chairman of the Patient's Association and a former nurse, will chair an advisory panel to improve standards at Holloway Prison.  The panel will also include prominent lawyer Helena Kennedy and leading medics from outside the prison system.  David Lancaster, the prison governor, is keen to improve the care and treatment of the 500 women prisoners held at the north London jail.  Some 75% of Holloway's inmates arrive with either psychiatric or drug-related problems, or both, putting intense pressure on detoxification facilities and psychiatric care.  Mr Boateng warned that failing to address health issues stored up problems for the women on release, and was a missed opportunity to tackle re-offending.  A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said the aim of the advisory board was to pool the expertise and experiences of people from outside and within the prison system in a bid to bring standards of healthcare up to the same level as those available in the community."
246,"Pictures of Michael Jackson in rehearsal two days before his death have been released    Michael Jackson fans who paid in advance for the singer's UK concerts have been offered their money back or a souvenir ticket as an alternative. Promoter AEG Live said the tickets feature graphics ""inspired and designed"" by the music legend, who died at the age of 50 on Thursday. An estimated 800,000 people paid £50-£75 to watch the star perform 50 concerts at London's 02 arena. The company will not be printing any further tickets as collectables. It adds that the originals will become collectors' items, and feature special images which give them a 3D moving effect. Fans have until 14 Aug to take up the offer of receiving the original tickets for the This Is It dates. AEG also released pictures of Jackson rehearsing in Los Angeles for the concerts just days before he died. Photographer Kevin Mazur, who captured his image several times in the 1980s, told the BBC: ""He was happy, he was energetic, he was full of life. ""I had such an adrenaline rush, it was like the first time I photographed him, when he moonwalked."" AEG president Randy Phillips said of Jackson: ""The world lost a kind soul who just happened to be the greatest entertainer the world has ever known. ""Since he loved his fans in life, it is incumbent upon us to treat them with the same reverence and respect after his death."" Ticket holders can get information about refunds or keeping the tickets at www.michaeljacksonlive.com from Wednesday. We asked you for your comments on this story. Please find a selection below. I'm going to keep my souvenir ticket, it may be the most expensive ticket for nothing I have ever brought but I will feel I still have a part of the night to myself. RIP Michael!  Richard Baker, Southampton Pay £75 for a souvenir ticket? They must think we're complete mugs! I had ordered 4 tickets, costing £300 PLUS an outrageous £30 for booking fees PLUS another £8 for secure postage. I think I'll have all my money back!  Simon in Leigh, Leigh on Sea, Essex, England We purchased tickets for the first and last nights of the tour. We parted with our money in exchange for 4 tickets and 2 Michael Jackson performances. What makes the promoter think I might now want to pay the same amount for just the tickets? I They would have made more money by offering all customers the chance for us to buy the tickets alone for £10 each.  Sarah, Milton Keynes What a con! £75 for a worthless piece of paper! Sounds like the promoters are desperately trying to keep some of the money they've made. Hope that this doesn't mean that they're going to struggle to pay back ticket holders...  Gemma, London I had paid £1,000 for two front row tickets..I've got an option of a refund and think I might take it as £1,000 is alot  William Nunes Dos Santos, London I bought a few tickets, I wonder if you can get a refund on some and take the ticket for one? If not then Ill be taking the refund as I paid to see the man not just for the glory of making a few quid.  Karen Lucas-Barrett, Camberley, UK I had tickets to the opening night, and I think it's awful that AEG are exploiting the fans by making them pay full concert price for the souvenir tickets. If they really wanted to treat us with 'reverence and respect' then they would offer the refund AND the tickets, and not make this blatant attempt to cover their financial losses.   Yva, Aberdeenshire, UK I have 4 tickets so I may ask for two refunds and 2 souvenir tickets. When Michael died I was not concerned about the money I'd paid for tickets I was just so sad. I even considered donating the money to his children or towards the funeral. But a souvenir ticket would be great.  Lisa Shone, London UK As much as I would love to keep the ticket £72 is a little to much to pay considering 800,000 people may get the tickets.  Ash, Chalfont St Peter Not sure if this a way AEG to recoup some of the money that they will lose. I will get my refund. I wanted to see Michael not hold on to a piece of paper. RIP MJ X  Doreen, Swindon, England Cheap trick by AEG to make money back that they have lost and probably are not insured to reimburse all 1 million ticket holders. What would have happened if they had sent out the tickets last week before MJ passed away? AEG are taking advantage of MJ fans who are some of the most loyal music fans and they know will take up the offer instead of a refund. Refund is our right and should be honoured, if AEG really care about the fans, why not give the tickets complimentary, or for any fan taking up AEG on their offer, why can't the money be donated to charity? Corporate Greed is being show in full motion. I for one will be applying for a refund.  Tan Araf, Stourbridge , UK I bought tickets to see Michael Jackson, but unfortunately cannot anymore. I think it is a great idea that souvenir tickets are available and shall definitely buy one. I am a great fan of his and have been extremely upset and I would love to see a tribute concert/gig by his sisters and brothers from Jackson 5 and family in the near future. R.I.P. Michael Jackson - King Of Pop.  Lorna, Swansea, South Wales While it would be nice to have a memento of the concert that could have been, it's just not worth to me the £150 I paid for two tickets. Sure they might go up in value over time, but with 800,000 tickets sold, they're very unlikely to become rare collectables. I'll go for the refund, ta.  David Tomlinson, Birmingham, UK I will be opting for a souvenir ticket...worth more in years to come!!!  Sameera, London As a huge Michael Jackson fan I would love to opt for the ticket, but it feels disrespectful to effectively 'buy a limited edition souvenir'. On a principle level it doesn't sit well with me for anyone to profit. I would feel a lot better about the idea if the ticket funds were donated to a charity/trust in Michael Jackson's name.  Tracey Davies, Monmouth, UK It doesn't seem to mention what happens to the people that bought the VIP thriller packages. I paid £795 each for my tickets including package. Will I get the difference back if I choose the souvenir tickets or will it cost me the full £795!  Tony Chadwick, Blackpool Why during all this pain do AEG continue to RIP off the fans? The £10.00 booking fee paid in addition to the cost of the ticket should cover the cost of printing the tickets, we should get a full refund on the face value and be given the ticket. Do they not realise that fans need the money back to go help pay for them to get to LA to say good bye to Michael?  Melanie, London I loved Michael, money has no value in front of him, so I will surely take the souvenir ticket,  Gaurav Agicha, India I can't justify spending £85 on a souvenir ticket so I will be asking for a refund. Would be nice if the fans could have both their money back and a ticket to remember Michael by.  Heulwen, Caerphilly Definitely will be asking for a refund. I am not surprised they are offering some kind of 'alternative' to actually having to give you your money back - I just wondered what tacky format it would take! Oh how AEG must have panicked at the thought of having to refund millions of £s to us poor fans!!  Silvercat, Birmingham, UK I see no value in accepting a souvenir ticket instead of a full refund. I find it quite perverse that the promoters are attempting to make money out of Michael Jackson's death, in effect reducing their exposure to the millions that will have to be paid back to ticket holders. I will certainly be asking for my money back.  Mike B, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire I cant believe they are going to try and charge us £75 for a piece of 3d card! I'm sure people would love to have these tickets, I know I would but I can't justify that price. Surely if they just charged us the admin fee this would be enough to cover costs. This is nothing but daylight robbery making money out of a dead man !   Julie Baker, Wimborne I did pay for my ticket at the O2 arena and I intend to get my money back. I understand that these tickets were supposed to be my ticket on the night. I feel that O2 are just trying to make some money and are using the ""souvenir ticket"" as an excuse. I am devastated at the news of Michael and I have been a fan all my life, but that does not mean O2 has to treat us as stupid. No holographic picture could ever replace what has been lost. Shame on you!  Kate, Bristol The money I am not bothered about, I will never get to see him play now, so I would rather have a treasured ticket as a memento of what could have been!  Lee, Alton, UK I did purchase tickets. I would like a souvenir, however, the cost is a little extensive for a concert that did not take place. Perhaps, a smaller amount would have been better. I have not decided at this time what to do. Its difficult as there must be a warehouse full of This is It concert merchandise which should also be offered perhaps. Or maybe the concerts should have continued in some form. That way we would get our souvenir ticket and a chance to say goodbye maybe! Pictures being released today look amazing. It is a shame especially for those who have not seen MJ live previously. Its not just him its the set and the special effects that make it a great show.  Heidi, Yate, South Glos Thoroughly disappointed that AEG think that they can keep hold of their money by selling us a ticket, which in essence is worthless, by playing on the emotions of fans. I'd like my money back thank you very much.  Rani, London, UK The ""offer"" of a refund or the chance to own a souvenir ticket is flawed and could set an undesirable precedent. The shows have been cancelled due the unavailability of the billed performer. The actual ticket would be only worth the paper it is printed on. The promoters and their appointed ticket agencies will have records of who bought the tickets so they should simply refund all their customers.   Russell O'Brien, Nottingham, UK Are they kidding? The tickets have no doubt already been printed and would have been sent to us anyway. The fact they are now trying to charge £80 for them in lieu of a refund is disgraceful. They should provide a refund and send the tickets. The booking fee will cover the ticket printing and shipping costs. Shame on AEG!  Darrell, Lytham St Annes, Lancs I'm going to get the money back and donate it to a charity for children to help heal this world.   Richard Alleyne, Birmingham England I ordered 4 tickets on Tuesday before he died. I'll keep one ticket but get a refund on the others.  Martyn, Feltham, United Kingdom I bought 4 tickets and would be more than happy to make a donation to one of MJ's charities to keep the tickets. However I do feel like this is AEG trying to recoup some of the millions it could be liable for. If AEG wants to give this option the money should really go to a well worth cause. Keep the MJ spirit going.  Aitch, Yorkshire I bought two tickets to the This Is It tour. I might get one refunded and the other I'll get the souvenir. It'll be a nice collectable for the tour that never was. I still have my ticket from his 'Last' tour, HIStory (which was brilliant!), so the two together would be quite nice  Rich, United Kingdom After numerous attempts, I actually did not manage to get a ticket for the concert. But this is really sick: the idea that fans can keep tickets as a souvenir is just another attempt to make money (one last time) out of MJ's death. Promoters should not be doing this, it is irresponsible, and capitalising on the grief of fans. If I had managed to purchase a ticket, I'd certainly be asking for a refund, not compensating promoters who are ticked off because their money-making plans didn't come into fruition.   Portia     "
247,"A puffin festival is to be hosted by a Northumberland town to encourage tourism thanks to a £10,000 grant awarded to help regeneration.  Amble's Development Trust and Business Club has been awarded the cash from the government for a campaign to encourage residents to shop locally.  The first Puffin Festival will take place in May to coincide with the best time to see the birds on Coquet Island.  It will feature community exhibitions, children's events and live music.  Amble Action Group member Ann Burke said: ""I'm thrilled the Puffin Festival can go ahead. So many people are so enthusiastic about it already, so many organisations want to take part. It's going to be a great community event.  ""We hope this will encourage tourism. Amble is unique in having an island so close where the puffins breed.  ""It will be an excellent opportunity to see the puffins and pufflings and we want to celebrate that.""  Colin Harris, chairman of Amble Business Club, said: ""We'll be consulting with local businesses for ideas to encourage local people to spend money in Amble first, before going out of the area.  ""It's not just about retail, we want people to use local service providers, tradesmen and professional services as well.""  The money has been awarded by the Department for Communities and Local Government through its Town Team Partners scheme.  Each year in spring and summer Coquet Island, which is a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) managed nature reserve, becomes home to 35,000 nesting sea birds, some coming from as far away as Africa."
248,"The mother of one of the Moors murder victims has died after a long battle against liver cancer.  Ann West's daughter Lesley Ann Downey was killed by Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, after abducting her on Boxing Day 1964.  Mrs West, 69, died at her home in Fallowfield, Manchester, on Tuesday.  She was at the centre of the campaign to ensure Hindley remained behind bars, and fellow relatives of her victims have described her as an inspiration.  Danny Kilbride, younger brother of victim John Kilbride, said: ""I have known her really well over the years; we fought for the same thing.  ""When I last saw Ann she told me she hadn't long left, and we all knew that, and she asked to carry on the fight.  ""This has only made me more determined than ever to carry it on, to ensure their memories live on and that Myra Hindley is never released.""  Winnie Johnson, whose 12-year-old son Keith Bennett was also killed, described Mrs West as an incredible woman.  Meanwhile, Lyn Costello and Dee Warner from Mothers Against Murder and Aggression said they were ""privileged"" to have known her.  ""She was an incredible and brave woman,"" they said.  ""We will remember Ann with love and pride and send our deepest sympathy to her husband Alan, her children and grandchildren.""  Lesley Ann Downey was 10 years old when she was kidnapped by Hindley and Brady from a fairground in Manchester.  She was stripped, gagged, sexually assaulted and strangled before being buried in a shallow grave on Lancashire's bleak Saddleworth Moor.  Mrs West saw photographs taken by her daughter's killers showing Lesley Ann tied up and helpless in the hours leading up to her death.  She also had to listen to Brady and Hindley's tape recording of her daughter's cries for mercy.  Mrs West was adamant that it was Hindley's hands which squeezed out her daughter's final breath and had threatened to kill her on many occasions.  She also vowed to haunt Hindley from beyond the grave, saying: ""I will still be a thorn in her side after I pass on, I will haunt that woman for the rest of her life.""  Over the years Mrs West had used psychic Doris Stokes to contact her daughter who she believed had visited her many times.  For years she had taken valium and high-dose sleeping pills to cope with nightmares.  Her doctors said that the years of stress had contributed to the cancer which affected her ovaries, breast, bowel and liver.  But the illness did not stop her campaigning and in 1997 she visited a High Court hearing on Hindley's future in a wheelchair.  At the time she told BBC News she was determined that Hindley should end her life behind bars.  She said she would rest in peace if the court ensured that Hindley remains in prison.  That wish was granted last year when the court agreed with successive home secretaries who had prevented the killer's release."
249,"The Ugandan leader, Idi Amin, has set a deadline for the expulsion of most of the country's Asians.  General Amin said all Asians who are not Ugandan citizens - around 60,000 - must leave Uganda within 90 days.  The military ruler's latest statement amended his original expulsion order two days ago when he said all the country's 80,000 Asians had to go.  Asians, who are the backbone of the Ugandan economy, have been living in the country for more than a century.  But resentment against them has been building up within Uganda's black majority.  General Amin has called the Asians ""bloodsuckers"" and accused them of milking the economy of its wealth.  Up to 50,000 Asians in the former UK colony are British passport holders.  In a broadcast, General Amin said he would be summoning the British High Commissioner in Kampala to ask him to arrange for their removal.  The expulsion order has taken Britain by surprise.  General Amin overthrew Uganda's elected leader in a military-backed coup last year but the British authorities had regarded him as a man they could work with.  Currently around 1,000 Asians from Uganda settle in the UK each year under an enlarged quota allocation introduced last year.  But a growing number have been attempting to circumvent the system and enter Britain illegally.  Right-wing MPs have warned that letting more Ugandan Asians into the UK could raise racial tensions.  They are urging the government not to take them in.  Conservative MP Ronald Bell said Uganda's Asians had no real links to Britain.  Speaking on behalf of the Monday Club's Immigration Committee, Mr Bell said: ""They were either born in India or have retained close connection with India.  ""They have no connection with Britain either by blood or residence."""
250,"Johnny Ball and Fern Britton are among the 14 celebrities who will take part in this year's Strictly Come Dancing.  Also competing are Olympic stars Louis Smith and Victoria Pendleton, model Jerry Hall, Kimberley Walsh of Girls Aloud and cricketer Michael Vaughan.  Denise Van Outen and actor Colin Salmon will take part alongside EastEnders' Sid Owen and Westlife's Nicky Byrne.  Actress Dani Harmer, Daybreak's Richard Arnold and ex-Emmerdale star Lisa Riley will also line up in Saturday's show.  In the first episode the stars will be matched with their professional dance partners.  At 74, former children's TV host Johnny Ball is the oldest competitor to participate in this year's show.  His daughter Zoe hosts Strictly's spin-off show It Takes Two, and Ball revealed it had been a challenge keeping his involvement under wraps.  ""I kept it secret from Zoe for over six weeks, which I hated doing as we tell each other everything,"" he said. ""She is over the moon with excitement.  ""I know that on It Takes Two she will be as impartial as it is possible to be for a girl who loves her dad. For me, the great worry is causing her embarrassment.""  Ball and his fellow contestants will hope to follow in the footsteps of McFly drummer Harry Judd, winner of last year's competition.  Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly will return as hosts, while returning judges Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman will be joined by ballet star Darcey Bussell.  Bussell previously appeared as a guest judge on the show and will now become a full-time member of the panel.  Previous panellist Alesha Dixon left at the end of the last series to join ITV1 show Britain's Got Talent.  Saturday's show will feature a red carpet event and a dance number around BBC Television Centre featuring the professional dancers, judges and hosts.  British cyclist Pendleton, who retired from her sport after winning gold and silver medals at the London 2012 Games, had previously spoken of her desire to take part in the show.  She said the show gives her something to ""focus on"" after the Olympics but admitted she was intimidated by fellow Team GB star Louis Smith.  The gymnast, she said, ""can probably dance loads better than I can - and he can do tricks as well. He's going to be flipping onto the dance floor, that's what I imagine.  ""I have no dance experience which is slightly concerning,"" the 31-year-old continued. ""People might feel sorry for me - I hope so.""  Smith, 23, won a silver medal in the pommel horse event and previously displayed his singing talents as a contestant on The X Factor.  Harmer, best known for playing Tracy Beaker on CBBC, was the first celebrity to be unveiled ahead of the latest Strictly series.  Walsh, whose involvement was confirmed over the weekend, has since tweeted a photo of herself practising with dancer Anton du Beke.  Salmon has appeared in the James Bond and Resident Evil film series, while Riley is known to millions of soap fans as Emmerdale's Mandy Dingle.  Strictly Comes Dancing begins on 15 September on BBC One at 18:30 BST.  Full details of all this year's participants can be found on the show's official website."
251,"Labour MP Tom Watson has compared News International chairman James Murdoch to a 'mafia boss,' during a parliamentary session about phone hacking at the News of the World newspaper.  Mr Watson has been a leading figure in the investigation into the extent of phone hacking and the degree to which senior company figures, including Mr Murdoch knew what was going on."
252,"With coal a nationalised industry, and some British mines unprofitable, coal mining was ripe for repositioning - and even privatisation - by Margaret Thatcher's right wing Conservative government of the 1980s. In the early 1980s, the National Union of Miners (NUM) was very strong, with high membership and strong links to the Labour Party. It was also defiantly left wing and militant, with no compunction against threatening industrial action. In 1981, there was the threat of strike when pit closures were mooted, and the government backed down, not feeling its position was strong enough. In 1983, Thatcher appointed Ian MacGregor head of the National Coal Board, which oversaw the industry. He had a reputation for swingeing cutbacks and closures from his previous role at British Steel. The coal industry was ripe for further confrontation between the NUM and the government, and resolutions were passed by various NUM regions to strike if pits were closed for reasons other than geological or resource exhaustion. By the end of 1983, with the Falklands War won and a mandate from that year's general election, Thatcher felt far more secure in her position and was willing to tackle the unions. The struggle over the mining industry would largely come to define her premiership.  In 1984, the announcement came that 20 pits were to close, with 20,000 jobs to go. It was later disclosed that the government, in preparation for the much-anticipated industrial action, had been stockpiling coal to take Britain through the winter. Initial locally-organised strikes across the UK became a national NUM strike in March 1984. But NUM leader Arthur Scargill decreed that NUM regions could decide whether or not to strike on an independent basis. Margaret Thatcher ratcheted up the pressure by referring to striking miners as ""the enemy within"". She continually referred to the action as ""the rule of the mob"". Scargill, in turn, compared the government's techniques in crowd control to those of a ""Latin American state"". The dispute had little chance of ending amicably or quickly. As the strike continued, strains and stresses began to be felt. The workers earned no money and were ineligible for benefits as the strike was deemed illegal; they had to rely on scrimping, saving and handouts. Personal relationships strained and sometimes broke as some decided to work through the strike, becoming 'scabs' in the lexicon of industrial relations. On the picket lines, buses carrying 'scabs' were attacked, and other disturbances took place. Miners clashed with massed ranks of police repeatedly and fiercely all over the country. Some industrial unions supported the miners and some disagreed, to the extent that the government gathered information from them. Observance of the strike within Wales differed from north to south. In the north, only 35% of the 1,000 men employed went on strike, and this had dwindled to 10% by the strike's end in 1985. By contrast, the south Wales coalfield contained the staunchest supporters of industrial action. At the start of the strike, 99.6% of the 21,500 workers joined the action. This reduced to 93% by the end. No other area retained such a level. With so many men not working in an area which was almost single-industry, South Wales suffered hugely with deprivation and community breakdown. Some areas broke down irretrievably, with the effects visible for years afterwards in ghost villages in the Valleys.  One incident in south Wales accelerated the ending the strike and turned some otherwise sympathetic members of the public against the miners. The killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver, was a tragedy and a public relations disaster for the NUM. Wilkie was driving David Williams, a working miner, to the Merthyr Vale mine with a police escort on 30 November 1984. Two striking miners dropped a 21kg concrete block from a bridge onto the car, killing Wilkie instantly. This coincided with a gradual slide in public and media support for the action, amid scandals and accusations. Families found it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves and the NUM funds were running too low to pay for pickets' transport. The official end of the strike came on 3 March 1985, when a vote was passed to return to work even without a new agreement with management. The pits closed rapidly over the next few years, and in 1994 the industry was finally privatised. In 1995 miners famously bought the Tower Colliery in the Cynon Valley, which opened in 1805, to keep it as a going concern. It became Wales' only working coal mine, and the oldest continuously worked deep-coal mine in the UK. That too, is closing due to dwindling coal seams, bringing to an end an industry which once employed almost 200,000 men."
253,"He had been arrested on Thursday at Belmarsh Prison, south-east London, where he is already fighting extradition to the US.  Police had been granted a warrant to question him until 2 September.  He was held on suspicion of commissioning, preparing or instigating terrorist acts in the UK.  British police had earlier said his arrest on Thursday was not related to the accusations in the US.  He was banned from preaching at Finsbury Park, north London, last year but he continued to address his supporters from the pavement.  The US authorities want Mr Abu Hamza to face 11 charges, include giving advice to those involved in a Yemen kidnapping in which three Britons died in 1989.  Other allegations include attempting to set up a terrorist training camp in the north-western state of Oregon and sending someone to Afghanistan to fight for the Taleban.  But Mr Abu Hamza's legal team say he will not get a fair hearing if he is extradited to the US."
254,"Radiation from Japan's quake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant has reached harmful levels, the government says.  The warning comes after the plant was rocked by a third blast, which appears to have damaged one of the reactors' containment systems for the first time.  If it is breached, there are fears of more serious radioactive leaks.  Officials have extended the danger zone, warning residents within 30km (18 miles) to evacuate or stay indoors.  It appears that for the first time, the containment system around one of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors has been breached. Officials have referred to a possible crack in the suppression chamber of reactor 2 - a large doughnut-shaped structure below the reactor housing. That would allow steam, containing radioactive substances, to escape continuously. This is the most likely source of the high radioactivity readings seen near the site. Another possible source is the fire in reactor 4 building - believed to have started when a pool storing old fuel rods dried up. The readings at the site rose beyond safe limits - 400 millisieverts per hour (mSv/hr), when the average person's exposure is 3mSv in a year. A key question is whether this is just a transient spike, which might be expected if number 2 is the source, or whether the high levels are sustained. In the meantime, the key task for workers at the plant remains to get enough water into the reactors - and, now, into the spent fuel pools - with the poor resources at their disposal.  The government later said that radiation levels at the plant's main gate had fallen sharply.  The crisis has been prompted by last Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan.  On Tuesday morning, reactor 2 became the third to explode in four days at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.  A fire also briefly broke out at reactor 4, and is believed to have caused radioactive leaks.  Reactor 4 had been shut down before the quake for maintenance, but its spent nuclear fuel rods are still stored on the site.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said they were closely watching the remaining two reactors at the plant, 5 and 6, as they had begun overheating slightly.  He said cooling seawater was being pumped into reactors 1 and 3 - which were returning to normal - and into reactor 2, which remained unstable.  There was a hydrogen blast in reactor 3 on Monday, following another in reactor 1 on Saturday.  Radiation levels in the Japanese capital - 250km (155 miles) away - were reported to be higher than normal, but officials said there were no health dangers.  Tokyo residents have been stocking up on supplies, with some stores selling out of items such as food, water, face masks and candles.  Housewife Mariko Kawase, 34, told AFP news agency: ""I am shopping now because we may not be able to go out due to the radiation.""  Radiation levels in Chiba prefecture, next to Tokyo, were 10 times above normal levels, Kyodo News reports.  In a televised address, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said: ""There is still a very high risk of more radiation coming out.""  He said that 140,000 people living within between 20km (12 mile) and 30km of the plant were at risk and should not leave their homes.  Some 70,000 residents within 20km have already been evacuated, and the premier urged anyone left in that exclusion zone to leave.  ""Now we are talking about levels that can impact human health,"" said the chief cabinet secretary.  He told residents: ""Please do not go outside. Please stay indoors. Please close windows and make your homes airtight.  ""Don't turn on ventilators. Please hang your laundry indoors.""  The government also announced a 30-km no-fly zone above the plant to prevent planes spreading the radiation further afield.  After Tuesday's blast, radiation dosages of up to 400 millisieverts per hour were recorded at the site.  A single dose of 1,000 millisieverts causes temporary radiation sickness such as nausea and vomiting.  Rolling blackouts would affect five million households on Tuesday, said Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), which runs the 40-year-old plant.  Japan's nuclear safety agency said earlier it suspected the latest blast may have damaged reactor 2's suppression chamber.  The BBC's Chris Hogg in Tokyo says that would make it a more serious incident than the previous explosions, which were thought just to have damaged the buildings housing the reactors.

255,"Nottingham Panthers secured a dream treble with a gripping overtime Elite League play-off final win over Belfast Giants at the National Ice Centre.  A freak Rob Lachowicz goal and Jonathan Weaver's rasping strike put Panthers 2-0 up at the end of the second period.  Belfast fought back to level at 2-2, through Robby Sandrock's sweet strike and Kevin Saurette's rebound.  But Jordan Fox grabbed the decider on the rebound in an extra period powerplay to break Belfast hearts.  Ultimately, it was the Panthers' powerplay prowess that proved the difference between the top two sides in the Elite League in a feisty and pulsating final.  Giants, who eased past Coventry in Saturday's semi-final, were smarting from having lost the League crown to Nottingham in their own backyard last month and desperate for revenge.  But, despite their sensational fightback when the trophy had already looked lost, they could not prevent Panthers completing a treble of Elite League, Challenge Cup and play-offs in front of a sell-out crowd at the sport's end-of-season showpiece.  Both goalies played a key role in a frantic but scoreless opening period.  Belfast were first to show, Panthers' Craig Kowalski - voted the best keeper in the Elite League - showing his quality with a trio of decent early stops.  But Kowalski's opposite number Stephen Murphy was then by far the busier for a 10-minute spell, making a series of top saves.  Nottingham's strength in depth began to show as the Giants struggled to cope with their pace and class whatever line was on the ice.  David Ling and Bruce Graham, a hat-trick hero in Saturday's semi-final win over Cardiff Devils, both hit the post in an almighty scramble and Lachowicz and Matt Francis were both foiled by the excellent Murphy.  But Giants ended the first period the stronger, Kowalski making two incredible saves on the powerplay to deny Noah Clarke and Saurette.  The intensity stepped up in the middle session as the game became increasingly fractious.  Panthers survived their third penalty with relative ease, showing just why they have the best penalty kill record in the league. And, having done so, they began to dominate again.  Steve Lee hit the frame of the goal for a third time for Nottingham and Murphy pulled off a staggering save to keep out David Clarke's vicious angled shot.  But the Panthers pressure was relentless and it finally told, albeit with a bizarre goal, when their opponents were short-handed.  Lachowicz was the man credited with the goal but his tip from a Patrick Galivan shot at goal went over and only ended up in the net when it bounced on the top of the net and rebounded in off the unfortunate Murphy.  Gregory Stewart should have levelled but could not react quickly enough to turn the puck in at the far post as it flashed across goal.  Panthers soon made them pay and again it arrived on the powerplay, and was beautifully and patiently created for Weaver who crashed the puck home.  Eventually Giants did find the net on the powerplay when Sandrock hammered the puck past Kowalski to bring a one-goal game early in the final period.  Another powerplay immediately followed and Jeff Mason almost levelled but Giants did not have to wait long to make it 2-2.  Kowalski saved Craig Peacock's initial shot but could keep hold of the puck and Saurette finished coolly from out in front of the net.  Giants expertly killed off six minutes of powerplay in the closing stages to force overtime.  But Fox won it, on another powerplay, to earn Nottingham a third successive play-off success."
256,"Ghana has inaugurated a presidential palace costing tens of millions of dollars in the capital, Accra.  The Golden Jubilee House, unveiled weeks before presidential elections, will house the president's offices and serve as a residence.  The main opposition party, the NDC, has raised objections to the cost of the luxurious palace.  But its leader, John Atta-Mills, has said he will not boycott the building if elected as president in December.  The original budget was $30m (£19m), financed by a loan from the Indian government.  The palace was built by an Indian contractor using Ghanaian sub-contractors.  The final cost has not yet been confirmed, but it is expected to be $45-50m, the BBC's David Amanor reports from Accra.  The main office complex resembles a traditional seat, important in Ghana's folklore, and the Kwame Nkrumah mausoleum built for the country's first president and representing a tree cut off in its prime.  The opposition has said the government has got its priorities wrong at a time when Ghana should be investing in infrastructure, health and education.  But at a ceremony attended by hundreds of guests and dignitaries on Monday, President John Kufuor said people look to the seat of government for ""national cohesion, aspirations, and inspiration"".  ""Even in a hamlet everybody knows the chief's house, which is the first port of call for all visitors,"" he said.  The information minister has said Ghanaians should not worry about the cost, but rather think of the value the new palace brings.     "

258,"The giving and receiving of gifts is a diplomatic tool    It's a story you think you know through and through. But how often does it turn out that in the retelling, a crucial detail has been misremembered? Once again a listener has set me off on a productive train of thought. A small correction has prompted me to reflect on the way that we historians, in the very act of reaching out to recover the forgotten connections between ourselves and our forebears, run the risk of overlooking what is right under our noses. But I begin with a little known story retrieved from the archives, that sheds some intriguing light on a piece of long-buried Elizabethan history. In the Beyazit Devlet Library in Istanbul is a document in Turkish, which contains an account of an exchange of gifts between the rulers of England and the Ottoman Empire in the 1590s: ""During the sultanate of Murad [it runs], the ruler of [England] was, it is said, a woman, Queen of a sizeable kingdom. This person, in order to approach the Abode of Majesty and the shadow of its protection, sent [Sultan Murad] as a gift a masterpiece of craftsmanship, a clock."" Being one of those who can recover glimpses of the past from the glorious relics among the records carries with it responsibilities    The so-called clock was in fact a highly ornate clockwork organ, ""a work of art, studded with jewels"" on which, according to the manuscript, the skilled technicians who accompanied the gift ""laboured for many years, toiling to complete and perfect it"". And although Elizabeth I intended it for Murad III, by the time the organ had completed the long sea voyage from London in 1599, it was his son Mehmed III who received it enthusiastically, and had it assembled and tuned in the seraglio for the entertainment of his harem. Mehmed responded with lavish gifts in the Turkish style. Their glamorous gifts to one another were part of a deliberate policy of cementing cordial relations between the countries. England and the Ottoman Empire had signed an agreement in 1581, granting English merchants preferential trading rights in the region, superior to any currently in existence with other European nations. Now, it was hoped that an Anglo-Turkish alliance might play a key role in creating an effective East-West force, to divide the military focus of the dominant and aggressively expansionist European power, Catholic Spain. There are to be found in your kingdom rare distilled waters of every kind for the face and odiferous oils for the hands    A generation later, however, the more austerely Islamic sultan Ahmed I had the clockwork organ destroyed. Nothing remains to tell us of its existence, except the documents in Turkish, Italian and English filed away in archives in London and Istanbul. While this story is remarkable as a cordial 16th Century exchange between the Protestant West and Islamic East, it has a yet more unexpected sequel. The musical mechanical marvel was not the only gift delivered to the court of Mehmed III. There was also a fine ceremonial coach, which was presented, with an accompanying personal letter from Queen Elizabeth herself, to the Sultan's mother, the Albanian-born Walide Safiye, who had enormous influence over the Sultan. The Sultana was delighted. She wrote an effusive thank you letter to Elizabeth in Turkish, in which she promised to use her best endeavours to ensure that her son stood by the treaty of cooperation he had signed with England: ""May you, too, always be firm in friendship! God willing, it will never fail."" Accompanying the letter was her own gift - a robe, a girdle, a sleeve, two gold-embroidered handkerchiefs, three towels, and a crown studded with pearls and rubies. These were the formal communication and gifts to go through official channels. But delightfully, Walide Safiye sent a second, less formal letter, written in Italian on her behalf by her entrepreneurial ""Kira"" - or intermediary - between the harem and the outside world, Esperanza Malchi, an Italian Jew (a woman one of the English delegation described as ""a short, fat trubkin""). ""On account of Your Majesty's being a woman,"" she wrote, the Sultana could without embarrassment ask a personal favour. Would the English Queen send her some English cosmetics, the renown of which had reached Istanbul. ""There are to be found in your kingdom rare distilled waters of every kind for the face and odiferous oils for the hands. Your Majesty would favour me by sending some of them by my hand for this most serene Queen; by my hand as, being articles for ladies, she does not wish them to pass through other hands."" This long-distance relationship between an English Queen and a Turkish Sultana was short-lived. In 1600 there was a coup in Istanbul in the course of which Esperanza Malchi was murdered. Three years later, England was ruled by a Scotsman, King James I. Nevertheless, this extraordinary sequence of documents - all to be found in the original and in contemporary Italian translations in the British Library in London - is evidence of contact and understanding between Eastern Islam and Western Protestantism long before most people would expect. Archival jewels like these Turkish letters have lain undiscovered for centuries in national and local libraries across Britain. No wonder the National Council on Archives - which campaigns for ""archives awareness"" - maintains that the nation's collections of historical documents ultimately contain everything we could possibly want to know about ourselves. In themselves, however, documents are effectively lost, unless they are reawakened by the attention and skill of an historian. It was only in the 1960s that the distinguished Ottomanist scholar Susan Skilliter brought the Turkish letters in the British library to more general historical attention. And being one of those who can recover glimpses of the past from the glorious relics among the records carries with it responsibilities. It was while I was working on this story that a courteous e-mail arrived from Dr Rozina Visram, pointing out a piece of misremembering on my part in my last Point of View column. It made me rush off to the library of the Warburg Institute in London, to check that I had remembered the Ottoman Kira, Esperanza Malchi's letter correctly, and to retranscribe its detail. Others may already have noticed the slip I made in the course of telling the story of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. I remarked in an aside that Ramanujan was the first Indian national to have been made a Fellow of the Royal Society. And I wrote that sentence while sitting at my desk within the Royal Society's Library, with the entire resources of its almost 350 years of archives and records at my disposal. Had I thought to check what I had, I believe, always been told, I would have found in a matter of minutes that Ramanujan was not the first but the second Indian national to become a Royal Society Fellow. The Parsi engineer Ardaseer Cursetjee from Bombay had been elected to a Fellowship almost 80 years earlier on 27 May 1841. His nomination paper (lodged in the society's archive) describes him as a ""gentleman well versed in the theory and practice of Naval Architecture and devoted to scientific pursuits"", and it credits him with having ""built a [sea-going] Vessel of 60 tons to which he adapted a Steam Engine"" and introducing gas street lighting in Bombay. The incident reminded me of the fragility of the jigsaw of human history we reassemble from its scattered documentary pieces. The 16th Century Ottoman Sultan's presents and letters belong to distant times and places. Recovering them requires all of our endeavours. Yet while we historians extend our efforts to try to give the past the depth and global reach needed to explain Britain's rich diversity today, our history closer to home may get forgotten. Dr Visram assured me in her e-mail that my error was ""not of much consequence, and does not in any way detract from what you were saying"". Perhaps so. But it is a timely reminder to those of us toiling in the archives that while we labour to recover the overlooked from the disparagement of history, we must also always take care not to be forgetful ourselves.

A character has survived a shipwreck. One of the great passenger liners. She remarks that the officer in each lifeboat had a knife or cleaver which they would use to cut off the hands or fingers of anyone trying to climb aboard the already overladen lifeboats as too many people would sink the boats. This is a tiny piece of history we have conveniently forgotten. You won't see it in films about the Titannic. There is so much like that, and the sort of thing that I love, and so few historians.   Pete, Leeds Insightful and intriguing article. I suspect that the majority would say history has no relevance. You may have begun the argument that it certainly does, and that it therefore merits greater study by a greater number, starting with our own history in these Isles.  Dr C. James Bacon, Abingdon, Oxfordshire Being a historical linguist, I am well aware of the difficulties involved in having little details of a story wrong. Sometimes, however, it is quite the other way to: Many years ago I used to stay at a small hotel in Ebury Street, London. Years later I came back to Ebury Street just to see it again. I remembered the hotel being on one side of the street, and a wine bar being on the other, a little further along at a corner. To my surprise, the hotel was no longer there - or rather, there was a hotel there, but with a different name. I enquired, and found that this had been 'my' hotel; it had removed to the other side of the street, and the current hotel had moved in. My memory was correct after all, which was a relief!  D. Fear, Heidelberg, Germany The mistake is fully understandable. But, it does give one pause to consider the vastly greater and more numerous opportunities to err in the historical records from times much earlier when the facts of history were transferred in the oral tradition, there being no scripts for encoding the phonemes, words, phrases, sentences, and grammatical structures of languages. And so, today, we are living with the fallout -- great tales of dubious prophets wrapped in cohesive but illogical and conflicting packages known as religion.   Scott MacKenzie     "
259,"Attempts by Biggs to be freed early have been turned down Jailed great train robber Ronnie Biggs has contracted hospital superbug MRSA and should be freed on compassionate grounds, his solicitors have said. Biggs, 76, who has suffered strokes and minor heart attacks and cannot speak, is in London's Belmarsh prison. His lawyers said medical reports showed he was in ""terminal decline"" and the case for release was ""overwhelming"". The Home Office confirmed an inmate was infected with MRSA during routine treatment at a local hospital. Biggs was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for involvement in the robbing of a Glasgow-to-London mail train in 1963. But he had only served 15 months of the term when he escaped from Wandsworth Prison. He has been held at Belmarsh since returning to the UK from Brazil in 2001. The Home Office said a Belmarsh prisoner developed a local infection after treatment and ""subsequent tests showed this to be MRSA"". Our client is a man who is extremely ill and can effectively die at any moment    A spokeswoman added: ""He has completed his treatment and further tests will be undertaken later this week to ensure the problem has been resolved."" Previous attempts to get Biggs freed on compassionate grounds have been rejected. Another failed appeal centred on the disparity between his sentence and the jail terms served by his co-defendants. The train robber's solicitors, Paul Martin & Co, said they have written to the prison authorities urging his release. ""The two consultant physicians clearly state the position as it is, namely that our client is a man who is extremely ill and can effectively die at any moment, to put it bluntly,"" the letter states. ""The Probation Service have already confirmed that there would be no problems whatsoever with regard to aftercare, and it is crystal clear that Mr Biggs is in absolutely no position whatsoever to even contemplate any criminal enterprise.""

261,"Bangladesh are on the worst losing run in the history of one-day cricket, hardly the perfect preparation for the World Cup.  It is almost four years since their last win - the shock victory over Pakistan at the 1999 World Cup.  They have suffered 25 defeats over four years, a world record that surpasses the one they established in losing their first 22 matches between 1986 and 1998.  In that period they have lost to each of the nine other sides that compete in Test cricket.  It is a sorry state of affairs and Bangladesh's place as the 10th Test-playing nation at cricket's top table has been seriously questioned.  For as well as their woeful one-day record, Bangladesh have yet to win a Test match in 17 outings.  Their present run of eight successive losses is also a record for the longer version of the game.  ""We still have a long way to go and need to work hard and concentrate harder to reach that kind of level.  ""But otherwise the morale in the side is fine and the discipline is excellent, which is very important.""  He is the third coach to occupy the post since Gordon Greenidge was sacked on the morning of that famous victory over Pakistan.  The West Indian was replaced by South African Eddie Barlow, a man held in high esteem in his adopted country before he left the post after suffering a brain haemorrhage.  Australian Trevor Chappell subsequently oversaw a relative downturn in the team's fortunes before he was, in turn, replaced by Kamal.  Never once in the run of defeats he has watched over has Kamal's team looked like winning.  A highest score of 226 was easily surpassed by Sri Lanka and would not have been enough in any of the 13 matches they have played over the last year.  And Bangladesh's bowlers are seemingly incapable of exerting any kind of authority over opponents.  However, a new losing streak is sure to start in the very next match and it remains to be seen how long it will last."

Founded on the strong but often tumultuous relationship between friends Carl Barât and Pete Doherty, The Libertines have enjoyed fame and infamy since they came together in 1997. The success of their 2002 debut album Up the Bracket, produced by Mick Jones of The Clash, followed on from a wave of interest in new indie guitar bands like The Strokes and The Vines.  The Libertines were championed heavily by the NME, but as their notoriety grew, so did Doherty's problems with drug addiction. This led to the breakdown of his friendship with Barât. Doherty even spent time in prison for breaking into Barât's home. Finding it difficult to play together, the two protagonists concentrated on their respective side projects, Barât with Dirty Pretty Things and Doherty with Babyshambles. The Libertines officially split at the end of 2004 with Doherty noticeably absent for much of that year.  Attempts to reunite the band have since followed, with Barât and Doherty patching their differences to temporarily play odd one-off shows, most notably their 2007 turn at the Hackney Empire in London.  Earlier this year they officially announced that they would be reforming to play Reading and Leeds festivals much to the delight of their avid fans. An impromptu teaser show at the Boogaloo in North London saw them play many favourites, alluding to what should be a greatest hits show on the Main stage. Expect emotions to be running high when Doherty and Barât join forces once more."
265,"A victorious Mrs Thatcher gave a speech from the steps of No 10...  Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan was forced to go to the country after his government lost a vote of confidence. Callaghan had had the option of calling an election in the Autumn of 1978, but decided to carry on and face the country after the economy had improved. Unfortunately the ""winter of discontent"" that followed severely damaged the government's economic policy and its standing in the polls. Although the government picked up slightly in the polls during the campaign, on 3 May 1979 Margaret Thatcher became Britain's first woman prime minister.  Callaghan had been Chancellor and Home Secretary in the 1964-70 adminstration and served as Foreign Secretary from 1974. He remains the only Prime Minister to have served in all three 'great offices of state' before entering Number 10.  Callaghan's parliamentary position became increasingly precarious. By April 1976 the government had lost its formal majority. The immediate reasons were a by-election defeat, the defection of two of Callaghan's backbenchers to form a new 'Scottish Labour Party' and the defection of the maverick John Stonehouse.  However, Callaghan managed to survive, mainly because the other opposition parties did not seem ready to unite to defeat him. By March 1977, after further by-election losses, he agreed to a parliamentary arrangement with David Steel and the Liberal Party which became known as the 'Lib-Lab Pact'.  The Lib-Lab pact ended in August 1978. The pact had been unpopular with some activists in both Parties, and in any case, an election was expected soon.  Callaghan could have gone to the country in the Autumn of 1978. The economy was improving and the Government had recovered some of its popularity. There was considerable speculation and controversy in the Cabinet about when the best time to go would be. Callaghan sought to end the speculation by singing an old Marie Lloyd song 'Waiting at the Church' to the TUC Congress. This was misunderstood in some quarters and he put the country's mind at rest in a broadcast in which he confirmed that he would not call an election until 1979. He was expecting that another round of pay policy would demonstrate to the electorate the success of his economic policy.  In the event, the pay policy did not hold and the scenes of industrial unrest were to be remembered as the 'winter of discontent'. Callaghan hoped to keep public sector pay claims under 5%. When tanker drivers forced the Government to give them a 14% raise, the flood gates opened. By the end of January, water workers, ambulance drivers, sewerage staff and dustmen were involved in industrial action, heralding the 'Winter of Discontent'.  When the devolution referenda were held, Wales voted 'no' and while Scotland voted 'yes' the majority was insufficient to make the decision binding. On the same day, 1 March 1979, the Government lost two by-election seats to the Conservatives. The SNP now withdrew its support from the Government and a vote of no confidence (on an SNP motion on devolution) was passed on 28 March. Callaghan called the general election for 3 May.  The Prime Minister pours scorn on the opposition as they prepare a vote of confidence . . .  One of the few surprises of the campaign was Thatcher's refusal to appear on the television programme Weekend World alongside Callaghan and Steel. Despite this, television coverage dominated the campaign as never before. All three major parties held morning press conferences co-ordinated for the cameras. Thatcher worked particularly hard to provide the media with photo-opportunities, whether it was by swinging her shopping basket, drinking tea in a factory or cuddling a new-born calf. David Steel was also camera friendly, although the media accused him of manipulating pictures by making sure he was filmed in narrow streets, giving the impression that he was surrounded by crowds of supporters.  The Government's manifesto, The Labour Way is the Better Way advocated an increase in pensions and tax cuts. However, opinion polls suggested the public believed the Conservatives were the party more likely to bring taxes down, spelling trouble for Labour. The Tory manifesto, The Conservative Manifesto 1979, promised to control inflation and keep the unions in check.  The one 'gaffe' of the campaign came from Sir Harold Wilson - the former Labour Prime Minister - who conceded in an interview with the Daily Mail that his wife might vote for the Conservatives, because their leader was a woman.  As the nation prepared to vote the Conservatives looked certain to win. They had put Callaghan through the wringer for Labour's handling of the economy. Their message was skillfully backed up by their advertising campaign directed by Saatchi and Saatchi, which claimed 'Labour isn't working'.  Shirley Williams lost her seat, as did Jeremy Thorpe, Emlyn Hooson, John Pardoe and Teddy Taylor, in what Margaret Thatcher called a 'watershed election'. John Major was among the new members returned at this election, as were Chris Patten, William Waldegrave, David Mellor, Ian Lang, Stephen Dorrell, John Gummer, and Frank Dobson. With a majority of 43, Mrs Thatcher had the opportunity to govern for a full term."

""People will say the father-son relationship is the heartbeat of his decision - it's not!

The Killie boss admits his personal relationship with Dean has changed since he became a player at the Rugby Park club.  ""The thing I've found the strangest is that I spoke more to him when he wasn't my player. I was always asking him how he was getting on.  ""But now that he's here, the relationship gets a bit more detached where your conscious he's a player and he's conscious I'm his manager. It sort of swings more towards that relationship.""  However, the signing of Shiels does not mean the Killie manager will drop his interest in trying to secure the signature of former Celtic and Hibs striker Derek Riordan.  And he predicts an understanding from their time together at Easter Road could be beneficial to Killie.  ""I'm still very interested in Derek because you could see the telepathic way they played when they were at Hibs,"" explained Shiels.  ""Both players make co-ordinated movement off each other and certainly they are good for each other.  ""They are intelligent players and that can only benefit our team.""

The Oxfordshire-based company was transporting part of a piece of cancer treatment equipment, which had been decommissioned at Cookridge Hospital in Leeds, to the Sellafield complex on 11 March, 2002.  But a ""plug"" was left off a specially built 2.5 tonne container to carry the contaminated material on a lorry.  Mark Harris, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive, said: ""Through pure good fortune no-one involved in the removal, containment and transfer of the source may have been directly exposed to the radiation beam.  ""The risk of such exposure was undoubtedly present - at Cookridge, during the journey and at Sellafield.""  He said detected radiation at Sellafield was between 100 to 1,000 times above what would normally be considered a very high dose rate.  Mr Harris said it was beyond the capabilities of normal hand-held monitoring equipment.  He said the radiation leak took the form of a narrow ""beam"", which was fortunately directed vertically into the ground.  Mr Harris said the result would have been much worse if the beam had escaped horizontally.  AEA Technology - which is a privatised arm of the UK Atomic Energy Authority - admitted a series of breaches of Health and Safety regulations.  The HSE has already asked for costs of £151,323."
268,"The first antibody which can fight all types of the influenza A virus has been discovered, researchers claim.  Experiments on flu-infected mice, published in Science Express, showed the antibody could be used as an ""emergency treatment"".  It is hoped the development will lead to a ""universal vaccine"" - currently a new jab has to be made for each winter as viruses change.  Virologists described the finding as a ""good step forward"".  Many research groups around the world are trying to develop a universal vaccine. They need to attack something common to all influenza which does not change or mutate.  It has already been suggested that some people who had swine flu may develop 'super immunity' to other infections.  Scientists from the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill and colleagues in Switzerland looked at more than 100,000 samples of immune cells from patients who had flu or a flu vaccine.  They isolated an antibody - called FI6 - which targeted a protein found on the surface of all influenza A viruses called haemagglutinin.  Sir John Skehel, MRC scientist at Mill Hill, said: ""We've tried every subtype of influenza A and it interacts with them all.  ""We eventually hope it can be used as a therapy by injecting the antibody to stop the infection.""  Professor Antonio Lanzavecchia, director of the Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Switzerland, said: ""As the first and only antibody which targets all known subtypes of the influenza A virus, FI6 represents an important new treatment option.""  When mice were given FI6, the antibody was ""fully protective"" against a later lethal doses of H1N1 virus.  Mice injected with the antibody up to two days after being given a lethal dose of the virus recovered and survived.  This is only the antibody, however, not the vaccine.  A vaccine would need to trigger the human body's immune system to produce the antibody itself.  Sir John said the structure of the antibody and how it interacted with haemagglutinin had been worked out, which would help in the search for a vaccine, but that was ""definitely years away"".  Professor John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary, University of London, said: ""It's pretty good if you've got one against the whole shebang, that's a good step forward."""
269,"The building of large hangars and arrival of foreign servicemen would normally make the Guernsey newspapers.  However, voluntary censorship meant the work of the submarine-hunting French seaplane base was kept secret throughout World War One.  Established in August 1917, the base was credited with the destruction of 25 German submarines and discovering three minefields and received the Croix de Guerre.  Just a year after it had appeared though the base was closed, and six months on all the buildings had been removed and life in the harbour returned to normal.  Historian Liz Walton said: ""They brought it over in kit form in big boxes... most of the planes certainly came in in kit form, they brought them on barges from Cherbourg.  ""[After the armistice] they just packed them all up and took them away again apart from some of the sheds and packing cases, which were auctioned off and brought by farmers who used them to house their animals.""  But, the 12 months of its existence proved crucial in combating an attempted blockade by the Germany navy, which had been in place for more than two years.  It had left all British merchant shipping in the waters around Great Britain and Ireland, including the English Channel, under threat of destruction.  The navy had also warned all neutral ships the area was ""a war region"" and they could be sunk without warning due to accidents of war and the alleged misuse of neutral flags by the British.  As would happen similarly in World War Two, it had resulted in starvation through a lack of imported food, becoming one of the biggest threats to Great Britain.  The country relied heavily on its imperial colonies and the US for its supplies of meat and grain.  Blocking this and the steady stream of men and materials being sent across the English Channel to the front lines was behind the move.  The task to enforce it fell to the German submarine fleet, which by the end of 1916 was taking a serious toll on merchant shipping.  In the English Channel, the job of stopping them already involved British and French airships, planes and naval patrol boats.  The introduction of a convoy system for shipping had helped reduce losses - ships heading for French ports in the English Channel joined up at Ushant, an island to the west of Brittany, and travelled along the French coastline.  Seaplanes based along the French coast were already covering the convoys but for one area, that between Treguier and Guernsey, prompting the site of a new island base to be investigated.  By August 1917, it was up and running with 100 French servicemen in the island and 12 seaplanes in action, although both of these numbers would grow.  The biplanes had a single float, their British counterparts had two, could carry a crew of two or three and two bombs on four-hour patrols.  Weather could be a real problem as when fully loaded with bombs and fuel the planes needed a longer run to take off than was available within the harbour and had to brave the swell at the harbour mouth.  Obviously the normal operation of the Guernsey harbour had to continue and the two did not always mix well.  The harbourmaster wrote to some boat owners asking them to move their boats, which have been left ""in the way of the seaplanes operating in the harbour"".  But, during the whole of the base's existence, there was only one casualty recorded.  ""Monsieur Drouet"", as he was described in a Guernsey Evening Press photograph of him relaxing at the island's Hotel de France, was named only as one of a number of ""well-known aviators"" popular in the island, shortly before his crash death.  The report of his ""unfortunate death"" did not reveal his military background as a pilot with the rank of petty officer or that he had been flying a French military seaplane to Guernsey.  His visit and those of others led to the building of four large hangars on the Castle Emplacement, including one in the drained Model Yacht Pond.  Among those to be awarded medals was Quartier Maitre (quarter master) Emile Chapin, who received the Medaille Militaire and Croix de Guerre for sinking a submarine in January 1918.  He is reported to have worn them with pride on the day of his wedding to Leah Badaire - the only daughter of the owner of the island's Hotel de France.  Pilot Officer Victor Lambert, who won the Croix de Guerre, later returned to the island as the French Consular agent in the 1960s.  A succession of seaplane companies trying to operate a passenger service to and from the UK and Jersey through the 1920s and 1930s, but most were relatively short lived as the route was not commercially viable.  An airport was built in 1939, but regular commercial services did not start until October 1946 because of the German occupation during World War Two, which ran from 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945."
270,"Pop star Marc Bolan has been killed in a car crash in south-west London.  The 29-year-old former T-Rex singer was killed instantly when the car being driven by his girlfriend, Gloria Jones, left the road and hit a tree in Barnes.  Miss Jones - an American singer who had just returned from the US - broke her jaw and is suffering from shock.  The couple's 20-month-old son was not in the car when they crashed at 0400 BST on the way to Mr Bolan's home in Richmond after a night out at a Mayfair restaurant.  Miss Jones' brother - who was following their purple mini - told police the car was travelling at 30 mph (48.3 km/h) when it crashed at a notorious accident blackspot.  Phillip Evans-Lowe was driving to work at a local dairy when he witnessed the smash.  ""When I arrived a girl was lying on the bonnet and a man with long dark curly hair was stretched out in the road - there was a hell of a mess, I rushed to get the police,"" he said.  According to the dead star's manager who was with them during the evening, Miss Jones had been drinking moderately at the restaurant.  ""They did not have a lot to drink - just a bottle of wine with the meal and a few after,"" he said.  Mr Bolan had just completed a television series and was said to be poised to make a comeback after spending the last three years abroad as a tax exile.  His former manager, Tony Secunda, said the son of a Hackney porter whose real name was Mark Feld had always feared he would die in a car crash.  ""He would never drive a car, he was always scared - Marc never had a driving licence, he refused to learn,"" he said."
271,"Former Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn says his dog could have negotiated better than venue bosses after details of West Ham's Olympic Stadium contract were published.  The Hammers will pay £2.5m rent annually but will not have to fund police, stewarding, heating, pitch maintenance, or even corner flags.  ""My dog could have negotiated a better deal for the taxpayer,"" said Hearn.  West Ham said it was ""a great deal"" for the club and the public.  The Premier League club move to the 60,000-seater stadium from the Boleyn Ground, which has a 35,000 capacity, at the end of this season.  Olympic Stadium bosses, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), fought a ruling that the deal should be published, but the appeal was rejected this week.  On Thursday, full details of the 207-page contract were published for the first time, including that:  West Ham have paid £15m towards the £272m costs of transforming the stadium into a football venue.  Hearn, who unsuccessfully tried to get the Hammers to groundshare with Orient at the Olympic Stadium, told BBC Sport: ""It's a hugely beneficial deal to West Ham and good luck to them.  ""They've negotiated a good deal. I can't say the same for the LLDC who should go back to negotiation school.  ""Frankly it was a hot potato that [London mayor] Boris Johnson and the LLDC wanted to get rid of. They wanted to close a deal at any price and they will say 'quite rightly because we didn't have anyone else'.""  The LLDC fought publication on the grounds of commercial sensitivity and fear the decision to publish will cost it million of pounds in lost revenue.  ""The stadium needs to be a profitable and successful commercial operation, otherwise it will rely on public subsidy,"" said a spokesperson.  West Ham insist the club have nothing to hide and believe their position as anchor tenant helps ensure the stadium does not become a ""white elephant"".  ""We were unanimously chosen as the anchor tenant, above others, including football clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient, as we offered the best deal and the only option for a true and lasting legacy,"" said a Hammers statement.  The deal was published after a lengthy legal battle following an initial freedom of information request from an alliance of 14 supporters' groups.  ""This is a victory for the power of football supporters - organised, focused and willing to work together to achieve a collective goal,"" said a coalition statement.  Aside from West Ham, who will rent the venue for 25 days a year, the venue will host concerts and other sporting events, including the IAAF and IPC Athletics World Championships next year."
272,"Old wounds were reopened this week when the failing health of the former Ugandan military leader Idi Amin became a hot topic for media outlets across Africa.  When reports that Mr Amin, who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, was in hospital in a coma first surfaced last Saturday, attention focused initially in Uganda on Mr Amin's state of health.  Radio Uganda, Monitor FM, and the Kampala-based, Muslim Voice of Africa radio ran the news near the top of every bulletin.  The paper quoted Mr Amin's ""favourite wife"", Nalongo Madina Amin, saying she had asked for Amin to be allowed to return to Uganda.  ""She said [Ugandan President] Museveni told her that Amin had abused Ugandans' human rights and so had to answer for his sins the moment he is brought back,"" the paper said.  ""Surely he should be allowed back home, so that if he is to die, he dies here,"" it reported her saying.  This question came to dominate Ugandan comment during the week: Should a very sick Mr Amin be permitted to come back to Uganda without facing trial for up to 400,000 deaths and disappearances during his rule?  The New Vision daily, which supports the government, headlined its editorial ""Amin's decision"".  ""Amin's case is complicated"", it said. ""He has a lot to answer for in the minds of millions... [But] Amin has a right to return home. At the same time, all Ugandans are subject to the law.""  The independent Monitor was unequivocal: ""Amin has a right to live in Uganda.""  ""Although his regime is associated with gross human rights abuses, Amin has not been convicted of any crime since he was toppled in 1979,"" the paper argued.  ""None of the governments that came after him has tried to extradite Amin to answer for his crimes... In the eyes of the law, the former dictator is still innocent until proven guilty!""  A commentary by Opiyo Oloya in New Vision speculated on where Mr Amin should be buried: ""His death can neither be accorded the resources of the state nor the sympathy of the public.""  ""The most the family should expect is to be allowed, at its own expenses, to bring the body for burial in Uganda. Many Ugandans killed by Amin never even got that much.""  Some Ugandan papers also tried to test public opinion.  The Monitor ran a survey, which concluded that ""Ugandans want former President Idi Amin back home.""  ""Ugandans also want the government to give him all the benefits of a former president. In case he dies, Ugandans said Amin should be accorded a state burial at the Heroes Ground at Kololo.""  But the lively and often bitter tone of the discussion board on the New Vision web site paints a more complex picture.  There are several dozen replies to the question, ""Should Amin return?"", with many contributors claiming first-hand experience of Mr Amin's brutality.  Another is convinced his father was killed by Mr Amin, but says proving it is difficult: ""I still have not seen the solid evidence that would sway an unbiased court.""  One contribution - ""No-one in this forum will convince me that I should forgive and forget about Amin's atrocities to my family"" - harvests several critical replies.  ""Anger and vengefulness... are NEGATIVE emotions, sapping up your nervous energy"", writes one.  Whilst another is sceptical about politicians in general: ""Show me one Ugandan president who has not killed massive amounts.""  ""Let's not get stuck in history, let's try to move on.""  BBC Monitoring, based in Caversham in southern England, selects and translates information from radio, television, press, news agencies and the Internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages."
273,"McLaren have ""serious concerns"" over whether they can win the world championship with engine partner Honda, says executive director Zak Brown.  The former world champions are facing their worst ever season after failing to register a single point so far in 2017 after a series of engine failures.  Brown said engine upgrades promised for Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix were not ready and the team is ""near our limit"".  ""Honda's working very hard but they seem a bit lost,"" he told Reuters.  ""We were eagerly awaiting this upgrade as were our drivers and it's a big disappointment that it's not coming.  ""It's not lack of effort, but they are struggling to get it to come together.""  Brown, who replaced Ron Dennis at the McLaren helm last year, added: ""Our preference is to win the world championship with Honda.  ""But at some point you need to make a decision as to whether that's achievable. And we have serious concerns.  ""Missing upgrades, and upgrades not delivering to the level we were told they were going to, you can only take that so long. And we're near our limit.  ""We're not going to go into another year like this, in hope.  ""There's lots of things that go into the decision and we're entering that window now of 'which way do you go when you come to the fork in the road'.""  McLaren's renewed partnership with Honda in 2015 was billed as a return to the glory days of their collaboration in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna dominated.  Yet McLaren remain without a race win since 2012 and their best finish this season was when Fernando Alonso, who started seventh on the grid, came 12th in last month's Spanish Grand Prix.  In March it was revealed McLaren had made an exploratory approach to Mercedes about engine supply in the wake of problems with Honda.  And Brown again raised the prospect of McLaren paying for engines in future.  ""Do I think you can win with a customer engine? I think you can,"" he said."
274,"A BBC investigation has raised concerns that a cycling event may have bought its way into the Olympic Games. Documents given to the BBC suggest that $3m (£1.5m) was paid by organisers of a Japanese cycling event to the UCI - the world cycling body. The payments were allegedly made in the 1990s. The event, called the keirin, was supported for inclusion into the Games by the UCI, and admitted in 1996. The UCI and its president at the time, Hein Verbruggen, deny any wrongdoing. The keirin is a rapid and exciting track cycling event where riders are initially paced around a track by a motorcycle before sprinting for the line. One of Great Britain's best Beijing medal hopes, Chris Hoy, is the current world champion in the discipline. The keirin is big business in its country of origin, Japan, commanding tens of millions of dollars in gambling revenue every year. But despite its financial clout, the one thing the event has always lacked is an international profile. 'We should really stop it' Back in the 1980s the Japanese successfully lobbied to put their race into the world track championships organised by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. It was a move that, according to Mr Koramasu of the Keirin Association, was initially greeted with some scepticism by the incoming UCI President Hein Verbruggen. ""In 1992, the world championship was considering dropping the keirin and it was a shocking thing for us. ""It started when Mr Verbruggen of UCI proposed dropping keirin from the world championships and we thought we should really stop it."" But four years later the tables had turned completely. Not only was the keirin a fixture in the world championship, it was - by 1996 - preparing to receive the ultimate prize for any sport, a place in its own right on the roster of the Olympic Games. The keirin was formally accepted by the International Olympic Committee in December of that year and entered competition in Sydney in 2000. Everybody knew the Japanese were supporting the world cup series and were supporting everything and I think everybody realised that they weren't doing it for nothing    So how did such a remarkable turnaround occur? For years there have been rumours in cycling that the Japanese gave money to the UCI in return for its promotion of keirin as an Olympic event. According to one member of the UCI at the time, the Japanese donated a ""big envelope"" in return for access. Denmark's Henrik Elmgreen was also a member cycling's governing body at the time. ""We must admit that when they came it was because the Japanese were very influential in the UCI and they offered a lot of money in order to promote this discipline. ""You can to a certain extent say they bought their way in but on the other hand it is a spectacular discipline. ""Everybody knew the Japanese were supporting the world cup series and were supporting everything and I think everybody realised that they weren't doing it for nothing. ""They wanted something in return and everybody knew what they got in return."" Mr Elmgreen says that everyone knew, but we have found no formal declaration of such a deal's existence. ... critics say that the system by which events go in and go out of the Olympics is seriously flawed, with little or no oversight    In fact, when we asked Mr Karamasu of Japan's Keirin Association, he categorically denied the deal had ever taken place. ""No transfer of money took place. ""What we did is that we supported establishing the cycling training centres in Japan and also we paid the set amount that all the National Federations pay for membership sort of a membership fee - I have to say I do not know about it at all. ""I have been in this position up until 1998 however I've never heard of any direct payment of money or cash"" But documents given to the BBC suggest a different story. They reveal a series of substantial payments to the UCI, which began just two months after the keirin was accepted into the Olympics in December 1996. Written on UCI letterhead one of the contracts states that the Japanese agree to support UCI projects in ""material terms"", in consideration of ""the excellent relationship the UCI has with representatives of the Olympic movement"". The payments total some $3m - that is about a fifth of the UCI's annual budget - paid as reimbursements for things like the routine travel expenses of top UCI officials including Mr Verbruggen, the man who is now in charge of the organising committee for the Beijing Olympic Games. In one six-month period in 1999, for instance, the Keirin Association paid for no fewer than five separate return flights on UCI business taken by Mr Verbruggen to the Netherlands, his home country. A source who was within the UCI at the time has told the BBC that the payments were explicitly a payback for getting the keirin into the Games. We took these revelations to Mr Verbruggen himself who denied that anything improper had taken place. ""It's been done in total transparency"", he said. ""This was done for the development of track cycling around the world."" However he did not directly explain how come routine air fares and other UCI expenses were being covered by the Japanese. We contacted the UCI to try and get some clarity on these allegations. They ignored our request. We then tried to get some clarity from the International Olympic Committee. Britain's Sir Craig Reedie is a member of the IOC's ethics commission which oversees such allegations. However he said it was not directly a matter for his organisation. ""The International Federations have their own set of rules. We would trust our International Federations to get this correct. It is a matter of trust."" The organisation's critics say that the system by which events go in and go out of the Olympics is seriously flawed, with little or no oversight. Their argument is that if you are careful enough and clever enough and you really want the golden Olympic ticket for your sport, there is every reason to believe that you can get your event onto the podium."

Mrs Adams told how around 100 heavily-armed rebels attacked her campsite in Bwindi National Park at 0645 (0345 GMT) on Monday after sweeping down from the surrounding hills.  She said they quickly separated Americans and Britons from the group and released most of the others.  Mrs Adams told the Evening Standard newspaper in London that the rebels had tortured the British.  ""The group holding the British people treated them quite badly,"" she said. ""A British guy was sitting next to me. I could see he had purple toenails from being beaten.""  After seizing their hostages the rebels marched them up a mountain path.  ""I told them I had asthma and they let me go. Did they think I might hinder them climbing? They could have shot me but they didn't shoot me. I didn't have my shoes and they gave me my shoes to walk.''  Mrs Adams, a businesswoman, was shocked when told some of her fellow hostages had been killed.  ""The sound in the valley, the vibration, was quite a shock,"" she said. ""I heard the gunshots and some noises. I got out of my tent and I walked around the corner to the front and I got caught.  ""I saw gentlemen running with guns and four of them came over and grabbed me, all the money that I had, and told me to sit down,"" she said.  ""After a while they brought some of the other captives ... from the other camps, marched them up and asked them what nationality they were. If they were British or American, they were sent to my group.''  The tourists had travelled to the game park in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest to track rare mountain gorillas.  Mrs Adams said her father had warned her not to go on the trip but she ignored him. ""It wasn't going to happen to me,"" she added."
276,"The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) were calling for the Queen and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to end the ""massacre of black bears"".  The 70 protesters, most of whom wore nothing but bear masks, claim the bears are slaughtered in Canada to make the famous headgear.  The protest was at St Peters Hill, near St Paul's Cathedral, in central London.  Some of the protesters held signs stating Bears Slaughtered for the Queen's Guards - Indefensible .  The demonstration lasted about 20 minutes and was meant to symbolise a pile of dead bears.  People from as far away as Australia, Poland, Spain, Hungary and Sweden were among those taking part.  Peta's Anita Singh claimed said at the protest: ""People wanted to show how passionate they are about this cause. Sometimes drastic things call for drastic measures.  ""Showing their vulnerable side depicts exactly what these bears go through. They are naked, they are vulnerable, and we are killing them.  ""It is indefensible cruelty. If you walk up and down the British high street you would be hard-pressed to find a reputable retailer selling fur because there is such a social stigma attached to it.""  The MoD said attempts to find an alternative had so far proved unsuccessful, but it was continuing to search for something to replace the bearskin.  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Dick-Peter said fake fur did not have the same qualities as the real thing.  ""It looks like a 60s Beatle wig. It just doesn't look right and if the wind blows it sticks up.  ""The rain soaks into the fibre and it ends up an extremely heavy piece of sodden material on somebody's head.""  The towering black hats date back almost 200 years and are a familiar sight outside Buckingham Palace and in ceremonies such as Trooping the Colour.

278,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Commuters will have their journey times slashed between major stations in the north west of England as part of a £200m rail electrification scheme. Plans to electrify three routes have been unveiled, following last week's pre-budget hint from Alistair Darling. It means faster electric trains will be able to run from Blackpool North to both Liverpool and Manchester. In July, the government revealed plans to electrify the intercity line between Liverpool and Manchester. The latest announcement is in addition to that project, which is already under way. Under the new scheme, lines to be electrified are: The 15-mile line between Huyton and Wigan, allowing electric trains between Liverpool and Wigan via St Helens The 25-mile route between Manchester and Euxton junction, allowing electric trains between Manchester and Preston, via Bolton The 17-mile route between Blackpool North and Preston, allowing electric trains between the resort and Liverpool and Manchester The government said the programme meant two-thirds of all passenger rail routes would be electric by 2017. Transport Secretary Lord Adonis said: ""Electric trains are not only quicker, but quieter, smoother and more reliable than diesels. This investment in rail infrastructure is good news but what isn't clear at this stage is how this will address the capacity issues passengers face    ""Electrification creates the opportunity to carry more passengers thanks to longer trains on these busy routes and to allow some 30-year-old Pacer diesel trains to be retired. ""It also allows existing diesels to be re-deployed to provide longer trains on busy routes elsewhere. ""This is a further step in the biggest electrification programme in a generation and it's a vital part of our rail investment and carbon reduction strategies."" Transport boss in Greater Manchester welcomed the announcement, but said more still needed to be done to tackle overcrowding. Councillor Keith Whitmore, chair of Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority (GMITA), said: ""This investment in rail infrastructure is good news but what isn't clear at this stage is how this will address the capacity issues passengers face. ""As regular users of the network will know all too well, peak-time services are already overcrowded and the demand for local rail services looks set to continue to grow."" Chief executive Anthony Smith said: ""Passengers in the North West will benefit from an electrified network as it will improve reliability and potentially speed up services which could reduce passengers' journey times. ""Passengers tell us that more trains, punctual services and getting a seat should be the industry's top priority and electrification will help address these.""     "

Bronson, 54, from Luton, was first jailed for armed robbery in 1974.  Since then he has held fellow prisoners and staff hostage on three occasions and carried out several assaults.  It is unclear what happened in the incident which led to Bronson's glasses being broken, but a HM Prison Service statement described it as a ""control and restraint incident"".  The statement said: ""A prisoner has been offered compensation of under £200 after a control and restraint incident.""  Bronson - who changed his name by deed poll from Michael Peterson in the 1980s - staged a 47-hour rooftop protest at Broadmoor in 1983, causing £750,000 of damage.  In 1994, while he was holding a guard hostage at Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes, he demanded an inflatable doll, a helicopter and a cup of tea as ransom.  Two months later, he held deputy governor Adrian Wallace hostage for five hours at Hull Prison, injuring him so badly he was off work for five weeks.  In total, Bronson has been held at all three of Britain's security hospitals and at least 28 conventional prisons.

Mr Lewis later said such language sent a ""terrible message to young people"".  But Mr Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, accused the minister of being ""cowardly"" for not letting him speak.  During the debate, Mr Lewis criticised Mr Mulholland and his Lib Dem colleague Mark Hunter for turning hospice funding into a ""party political issue"", adding that this was ""absolutely opportunistic and disgraceful"".  Mr Mulholland, who spoke for about 10 minutes during the course of the debate, asked Mr Lewis to give way three times as the minister was giving his response.  After the third refusal, Mr Mulholland is quoted in Hansard - the record of parliamentary debates - as saying: ""He's an a*******.""  Mr Lewis then commented: ""That was not very parliamentary language.""  A spokeswoman for the Speaker of the House of Commons said she could not comment on whether a complaint had been received or an investigation was under way.  Mr Mulholland later told the BBC: ""The minister's extraordinary rant was completely out of place in this debate, in which MPs from all sides contributed sensibly and sensitively to this important subject.  ""It is sad that instead of listening to the very real concerns of the hospice movement and the problems of funding they face, he instead launched a nasty and misleading party political attack, then wouldn't let me respond to correct the record which was downright cowardly.  ""He should be less interested in trying to score points and actually listen to issues of real concern in his area of responsibility.  ""It is unfortunate that the official recorder picked up me expressing my anger about this performance to colleagues as I left the chamber, but I am certainly not the only one who thought that the minister's behaviour was disgraceful and uncalled for.""  Mr Lewis responded: ""It is sad that a debate on such a sensitive and important issue such as hospice funding was spoilt by Mr Mulholland's extraordinary behaviour.  ""The two Liberal Democrat MPs were the only speakers who sought to make cheap and misleading party political points.  ""The fact that I rebutted their attacks prompted an outburst unbecoming of a parliamentarian.""  Mr Lewis added: ""I hope Mr Mulholland will reflect on the fact that the use of such language is not only inappropriate but sends out a terrible message to young people about the importance of decency and civility.  ""This is now a matter for the Liberal Democratic leadership.""  Last month, Hansard had to be changed after Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth was recorded to have muttered ""absolute bollocks"" during a Commons debate on troops' kit shortages.  Unparliamentary language - which includes that which is insulting, coarse, or abusive - is banned, as are accusations of lying, being drunk and misrepresenting the words of another MP.  Among the words to which Speakers have objected over the years are ""blackguard"", ""coward"", ""git"", ""guttersnipe"", ""hooligan"", ""rat"", ""swine"", ""stoolpigeon"" and ""traitor"".  The Speaker has the power to direct an MP who has used an unparliamentary word or phrase to withdraw it.  An MP who refuses to retract an offending expression may be ""named"", after which the Commons can vote on whether to suspend them."
282,"   , the biggest integrated multimedia broadcast and production group of its kind in the world, launched today with a mission to create great programmes for audiences in the rapidly changing digital world. Setting out the new Vision structure to staff today, Director of Vision Jana Bennett told them that, in future, more BBC programmes would need to work on many different platforms such as the web, mobile phones and interactive technologies. She said: ""Our creative purpose is to deliver great programmes and great content to all our audiences. ""The future will still be a place where audiences value great storytelling, elegant structure, high production values - all the traditional strengths of BBC programme makers. ""But at the same time we need to develop fresh ways of thinking and using technology. ""There are incredible opportunities in this new world if we can only organise ourselves to seize those opportunities and make them work for our audiences."" BBC Vision - so called because it makes BBC content that people watch - brings together several former BBC divisions: Drama, Entertainment and Children's (DEC); Factual and Learning; Television; and Network Production in the Nations. This follows a restructure plan announced by BBC Director-General Mark Thompson earlier this year. Other BBC Groups coming together today are Audio and Music, Journalism and Future Media and Technology. Jana Bennettsaid there were two big ideas behind the creation of Vision: A ""one-stop shop"" for multi-platform commissioning where creative ideas - whether in-house or independent - could be looked at in the round and assessed for their full creative potential across all appropriate platforms; A content powerhouse, Vision Studios, the biggest multi-platform production house of its kind in the world, bringing together about 4,000 programme makers in 17 ""studios"". Jana Bennett has appointed Peter Salmon as Chief Creative Officer to run Vision Studios. Jana and Peter unveiled a series of announcements and initiatives to set the ball rolling as Vision opened for business. Four senior appointments to complete the top team - see separate release; New senior roles to bring multi-media expertise to the heart of BBC Vision; Opportunities for thousands of programme makers to gain new multi-media skills and experience of different areas of programming. Vision commissioning would be a ""meritocracy,"" Jana said, ""to make sure that BBC audiences get the best content, wherever the ideas originate - inside or outside the BBC."" The BBC draws at least 25% of its programming from independent production companies by statutory quota, and another 25% makes up the Window of Creative Competition open to competition between independents and in-house producers. The remaining 50% goes to the BBC's in-house programme makers under the In-House Guarantee. Jana said: ""The In-House Guarantee will mean that for the first time there will be a guarantee to source 50% of programming from in-house production. That means that half the money Vision invests in content will go to Vision Studios."" Peter Salmon hailed the In-House Guarantee as one of Vision Studios' ""reasons to be cheerful"". He said: ""There's no other programme-maker in the world whose business has that kind of rock-solid financial underpinning. And that's before we start competing for what's on offer under the WOCC, which I want us to target hard."" In addition to today's appointments, Jana announced new senior multi-media roles, to be funded from re-prioritisation. A Head of Multi-Media Studio to oversee the centre of excellence for multi-media production in Vision Studios; A Future Media and Technology Controller for Vision, who will report to Director of FM&T Ashley Highfield, but be part of the Vision senior team, will be appointed shortly. Part of the existing Think Big fund, set up to expand television projects, will be steered into multi-platform content, starting with £10m in the coming financial year, Jana announced. Peter Salmon said he wanted to make Vision Studios ""a great place to work"". Multi-platform programming would require new skills and offer new opportunities, and so would the scale of Vision Studios. He said: ""We are doing extraordinary things; with a bit more leadership, more support and a clear direction we can do even more."" unveiled a range of training initiatives to encourage in-house programme makers to build up multi-media skills and experience of other studios. ""Hot Shoes"" attachments for people to experience two weeks' working in a completely different area. 250 opportunities in the next year; Encouragement for programme makers to work in different parts of Vision Studios. ""Over the next five years I want to see two fifths of our 4,000 plus people working in more than one studio. That's more than 1,500 people."""
283,"The note featuring Boulton and Watt will be introduced in 18 months    Two giants of the industrial age are to appear on a redesigned Bank of England £50 note. Scottish engineer James Watt and his business partner Matthew Boulton, from Birmingham, developed the steam engine. Bank of England governor Mervyn King said their 18th Century innovations were essential in driving Britain's Industrial Revolution. It is the first time two portraits have appeared together on the note. An image of the Queen appears on the other side. Inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt was born in Greenock in 1736 and carried out some of his first experiments with steam power in Glasgow. His partnership with Matthew Boulton, who owned the Soho Foundry in Birmingham, gave him access to the latest metal working techniques. Many of the advantages society now enjoys are due in large part to the vital role of engineering and the brilliance and foresight of people such as Boulton and Watt,    The resulting Boulton and Watt engine proved far more efficient than previous designs, and was soon being used in coal mines and cotton factories. The new banknote, to be launched in 18 months, includes an image of a steam engine and the Soho factory. Mervyn King said: ""So many of the advantages society now enjoys are due in large part to the vital role of engineering and the brilliance and foresight of people such as Boulton and Watt, whose development and refinement of steam engines gave an incredible boost to the efficiency of industry."" He added: ""The unique and rare opportunity that the bank has through its banknotes to acknowledge and promote awareness of our nation's heritage of artistic, social and scientific endeavour is an honour for us. ""The bank's choice of Boulton and Watt, a reminder of the invaluable contribution from engineering and the entrepreneurial spirit to the advancement of society, I think, well reflects this."" The new note will circulate initially in tandem with the existing £50 note featuring the first Bank of England governor Sir John Houblon, but the older note will gradually be withdrawn.     "
284,"Northern Ireland Secretary Paul Murphy wants parliamentary allowances for the four Sinn Fein MPs to be removed.  He has given the party until next Tuesday to defend itself before a final vote is taken on the sanctions.  Sinn Fein's Alex Maskey said his party had no links to crime and called the move ""a distortion of democracy"".  Mr Murphy also confirmed a ban on Sinn Fein's £120,000 Stormont assembly grant for earlier IRA crime, is to be extended for another 12 months.  Michael McDowell, the Irish justice minister, had named Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris - a Sinn Fein MP in the Dail - as being among the IRA's Army Council.  Mr Murphy said he would not name individuals, but ""agreed entirely"" about links between Sinn Fein and the paramilitary group.  A report by the Independent Monitoring Commission, which monitors paramilitary activity, last month recommended imposing financial penalties on Sinn Fein.  It backed the police assertion the IRA was behind the £26.5m raid at the Belfast headquarters of Northern Bank on 20 December - a claim the IRA denies.  Mr Murphy told the Commons the report had concluded the Provisional IRA had ""planned and undertaken"" the bank raid as well as three other major robberies last year.  Mr Murphy said he understood why some believed sanctions were not tough enough, but he rejected calls to exclude Sinn Fein from the political process, saying the move would not deliver ""long-term stability"".  But he said the decision would have been ""very different"" had the assembly not been suspended.  Addressing calls for the assembly to be reconvened and then action taken to exclude Sinn Fein, he said: ""I have not ruled anything in or out.""  The £120,000 sanction would come into effect on 29 April, the day after an existing sanction expires.  Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said he agreed with the British government's decision not to leave Sinn Fein out of the political process.  ""I welcome what Paul Murphy said today,"" he said.  ""The British clearly believe that inclusive means is the only way and isolationism is not the way.""  Criticising the sanctions, former Belfast Lord Mayor Alex Maskey said Mr Murphy ""has no right to discriminate against democratically elected Irish politicians"".  ""We will continue to fight this discrimination politically, legally and through an ongoing campaign of democratic resistance.""  But the move was backed by DUP leader Ian Paisley.  ""The time has come for this government and this House to set its own affairs in order and say there is no place in a democracy for armed terrorists and for their campaign of crime and their campaign against the decent citizens of Northern Ireland.""  UUP leader David Trimble said he wanted more stringent sanctions.  However, the SDLP's Seamus Mallon said: ""The IRA and Sinn Fein thrive on victimhood and grievances. This House should not facilitate them by handing them any more.""  Shadow Northern Ireland secretary David Liddington backed the sanctions and called for Sinn Fein to be excluded.  Lembit Opik, for the Liberal Democrats, said his party would support the move if the IRA was proved responsible for the Northern Bank robbery and other recent crimes."
285,"Pairs of this northern European species meet up in exactly the same place each year having spent many months and many kilometres apart. And the synchrony of the reunion has astonished researchers.  ""The intriguing thing about these birds is that when they arrive back in Iceland to begin breeding each year, marked pairs of birds - male and female that have previously paired - get back to their territory almost at exactly the same time,"" Jennifer Gill, of the University of East Anglia, UK, told BBC World Service's Science In Action programme.  ""There's only, on average, three days between the male arriving and the female - even though the whole population of godwits takes about a month to get back to Iceland.""  Godwits (Limosa limosa islandica), which are wading birds, usually mate for life and can live for up to 25 years.  Males and females live in separate areas of northern Europe, in places as far apart as Britain, Portugal, Ireland and France.  In the spring, they fly up to Iceland, where almost the entire population breeds in the lowland areas.  But what makes the godwits exceptional is that the same pair finds each other year after year - and on time.  ""If you think about how on Earth these birds manage to achieve that synchrony, the simplest solution would be for the birds to stay together throughout the year - to leave the breeding ground, travel south together, stay together through the winter and come back together,"" she said.  ""What we found with godwits, because we have these marked rings on them and can follow them throughout the year, that's not actually the case - male and female godwits winter in completely different areas.""  Knowledge of exactly when the pair are meant to meet is clearly essential to the relationship lasting - as shown by the occasions godwit males are observed to turn up late by mistake.  ""In the two cases where we've recorded that so far, both have ended up in divorce,"" Dr Gill said.  However, the researchers still do not know exactly how the birds achieve such precise timing and navigation.  ""Migrant birds are known to be phenomenally good at selecting a route back to exactly the same location that they've been in previous years, and they use all sorts of cues to do that,"" she explained.  ""But how they sort out the timing to such a degree of accuracy, we're really not sure.""  It is suspected that the birds' abilities are related to the quality of wintering grounds - a good wintering site may encourage them to leave early.  ""They could winter in areas of similar quality so they are ready to breed at the same time; there could be a genetic or psychological similarity between the paired birds; or they may time their arrival to coincide with the best conditions, exploiting peaks in food availability, for example,"" speculated Dr Gill.  ""We suspect that this situation may be common to many other species of migratory bird as well - for which we unfortunately don't have the data.""  The godwits' remarkable synchrony was recently reported in the journal Nature. The lead author on the paper was Tomas Gunnarsson."
286,"Wales' record international try-scorer Shane Williams has completed a U-turn on his rugby retirement and will play for a Japanese side next season.  The 35-year-old wing has signed for the Mitsubishi Dynaboars in Division Two of the Japanese League on a one-year deal.  Williams scored twice in his final competitive game as Ospreys .  ""It was a last-minute offer that I had to give great thought to in a short space of time,"" Williams told Twitter.  ""Really looking forward to this exciting venture.""  Williams announced his in February after he turned down Ospreys' offer to extend his playing career with the Welsh region to a 10th season.

Williams signed off from the international stage in typical fashion, scoring a last-gasp try in the in Cardiff on 3 December.  The double-Grand Slam winner was also Ospreys' record try-scorer, with 57 touchdowns in 141 matches, and scored late on in his last game for both club and country.  But Williams' final appearance in Europe was for the Barbarians in their in Cardiff on 2 June.  He was expected to continue his association with the Ospreys next season by with the Liberty Stadium club but the Welsh region have released him for this ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity.  An Ospreys statement said: ""Taking into account his fantastic service to the Ospreys, we understand that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Shane and his family to experience a new culture and life in a new country and will not stand in his way.  ""We wish them the best of luck in Japan and look forward to welcoming Shane back to Ospreylia upon completion of his playing commitments, when he will continue to represent the region with distinction off the field.""  Williams is second in international rugby's all-time try-scoring list behind Australian wing David Campese.  And the legendary wing follows former Ospreys team-mates Jerry Collins and Filo Tiatia, who joined Yamaha Jubilo and Toyota Verblitz respectively in 2011, to Japan."
287,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The UK's former chief drugs adviser has accused Gordon Brown of reclassifying cannabis for political reasons. Prof David Nutt also predicted there would be further resignations from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs after he was made to quit as its head. The professor said Mr Brown had ""made up his mind"" to make cannabis a Class B drug, despite evidence to the contrary. The home secretary said he had ""lost confidence"" in Prof Nutt, accusing him of ""lobbying for a change in policy"". Earlier this week, Prof Nutt used a lecture at King's College, London, to say that smoking cannabis created only a ""relatively small risk"" of psychotic illness and it was actually less harmful than nicotine or alcohol. But on Friday he was forced to quit after receiving a letter from Home Secretary Alan Johnson who said his comments had undermined the scientific independence of the council. Prof Nutt told the BBC the government had ignored advice on cannabis ""on the whim of the prime minister"". ""Until Gordon Brown took office there has never been a recommendation about drug classification from the council that has been rejected by government,"" he said. I think it's a lack of courage from government that is a big issue here    ""Gordon Brown comes into office and soon after that he starts saying absurd things like cannabis is lethal... it has to be a Class B drug. He has made his mind up. ""We went back, we looked at the evidence, we said, 'No, no, there is no extra evidence of harm, it's still a Class C drug.' ""He said, 'Tough, it's going to be Class B.'"" Prof Nutt said drug laws should not be influenced ""petty party politics"" and compared them to interest rates, which are set by the Bank of England not the government. In the same way, he said, an independent committee should be set up to rule on drug classifications. ""There's no point in having drug laws that are meaningless and arbitrary just because politicians find it useful and expedient occasionally to come down hard on drugs. ""That's undermining the whole purpose of the drugs laws."" Prof Nutt said his council was ""very, very upset by the attitude the prime minister took over cannabis"" and one had already told him he would resign. ""I wouldn't be surprised if some of the them step down - maybe all of them will,"" he added. Former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King said Prof Nutt had ""stepped over the line"" in criticising politicians, but it was ""absolutely wrong"" of Mr Johnson to try to stop him making his opinions about cannabis public. We are witnessing a collision between science and politics - there may be significant fall-out    Read Mark's thoughts in full and the correspondence between Alan Johnson and Prof Nutt ""I think that the government has lacked courage in backing David's committee's advice,"" Sir David said. ""I think it's a lack of courage from government that is a big issue here."" The BBC's Danny Shaw said Prof Nutt had accused the government of using the classification system as a tool to send out an anti-drugs message, rather than to rate drugs in terms of actual risk. Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said the sacking had been ""an inevitable decision"" after Prof Nutt's ""latest ill-judged contribution to the debate"". But Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the decision to sack the adviser had been ""disgraceful"". Harry Shapiro, director of communications at DrugScope, said: ""It would be naive not to expect those tasked with giving advice on drug policy to generate some controversy and debate. ""The home secretary's decision to force the resignation of the chair of an independent advisory body is an extremely serious and concerning development and raises serious questions about the means by which drug policy is informed and kept under review."" Meanwhile, the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee has asked Mr Johnson to clarify why Prof Nutt was removed at a time when independent scientific advice was essential. Phil Willis MP, Chairman of the committee, said: ""It is disturbing if an independent scientist should be removed for reporting sound scientific advice."" But Prof Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, said ministers had rejected advice in the past and would continue to do so. He said: ""Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view... When that happens, then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice and I think that's generally accepted as the principle.""     "
288,"Guinness Four fail in fight for acquittal   By BBC News Online's Mike Verdin They were convicted in what was dubbed the trial of the 20th century. But the Guinness Four have failed to win acquittal in what could have been the legal appeal of the 21st. While the famous black beverage itself may promise rewards to those who wait, Jack Lyons, Anthony Parnes, Gerald Ronson and Ernest Saunders have failed to clear their names after 15 years of legal battles in the UK and on the Continent. Convictions - achieved thanks to an insider trader who inspired a Hollywood blockbuster, as well as a man once tipped as a Conservative Party leader - have withstood challenges based in part on the evidence of a supergrass who helped sink a £132m drug ring. Friday's decision will come as a particular disappointment to Mr Lyons whose campaigning to ""lift a cloud of injustice"" prompted the latest hearings. Ernest Saunders: Former Guinness chief executive. Jailed for 5 years, halved on appeal, for false accounting, conspiracy, and theft. Jack Lyons: Consultant. Fined £3m for theft and false accounting. Stripped of knighthood Anthony Parnes: Trader. Jailed for 30 months, reduced on appeal to 21 months, for false accounting and theft. Gerald Ronson: Businessman. Jailed for a year, and fined £5m, for false accounting and theft. He was in 1986, when asked to advise Guinness on an ambitious takeover proposal, Sir Jack Lyons, a management consultant renowned for his philanthropy, whose acquaintances included former prime minister Sir Edward Heath. Guinness, with Mr Saunders as chief executive, had hatched plans to buy Distillers, a larger drinks firm which owned whisky brands including Dewars and Johnnie Walker. The move would consolidate Guinness's transformation, under Mr Saunders' leadership, from a stout brewer into a drinks business of international standing. And he earned widespread plaudits for pulling off the £2.6bn deal, trumping a bid from foods group Argyll. But, having been the toast of the City, Mr Saunders was within months being grilled by official inspectors. 1990: All four convicted over illegal support for Guinness shares 2001: Cases of all four referred back to Court of Appeal His downfall was prompted by the arrest for insider dealing of Ivan Boesky, the US arbitrageur who coined the phrase ""greed is good"", echoed in the film Wall Street. In a plea bargain, Mr Boesky told US authorities of a share dealing arrangement organised to underpin Guinness's stock price when it was pursuing Distillers, boosting the attractiveness of the bid. In December 1986, the UK Department of Trade and Industry opened investigations into the takeover, and a month later charged Ernest Saunders with an array of financial offences. Mr Lyons was charged in October 1997, as a DTI inquiry overseen by promising Conservative minister Michael Howard dug deeper into the mechanics of the deal. Gerald Ronson, the Heron boss credited with bringing self-service petrol stations to Britain, was charged days later, with the last of the Guinness Four - stock trader Anthony Parnes - charged the following March. By 1990, fraud investigators had amassed sufficient evidence to bring all four to court. The DTI said that Mr Saunders, while not the author of the share support operation, had been fully aware of its progress. He had agreed that Guinness should pay Mr Parnes, known as ""The Animal"" in the City, £3.35m for intelligence gathering and share support activities, the court heard. Companies in Mr Ronson's Heron group were to receive a £5m ""success fee"" for their support, should the deal come off, the DTI found. And Mr Lyons received a £3m payment, despite not undertaking ""a tithe of the work done by Mr Parnes, proper or improper"", investigators claimed. The ending of the six-month Crown Court trial, however, marked only the beginning of a series of further ructions surrounding the case. Mr Saunders had his five-year sentence halved on appeal, and was released from prison after only 10 months when a medical report said he was suffering from the irreversible brain disease Alzheimer's. Mr Saunders was unable to recall three numbers backwards, or to remember the name of the US president, a psychiatrist said. Since his release, Mr Saunders has worked as a marketing consultant for the likes of Carphone Warehouse, and is said to consider the Alzheimer's diagnosis an error. Mr Saunders was also, with the rest of the Guinness Four, able to continue a campaign for full acquittal. While the four suffered rejection in an appeal bought on the basis of evidence relating to City takeover guidelines, Mr Lyons had a conspiracy for conviction quashed in 1995. And a year later came the landmark ruling which paved the way for the latest appeal. It was based not on questions of guilt or innocence, but on the way the information presented to the Crown Court had been obtained. For the DTI investigators had, backed by UK law, forced the four men to answer questions under threat of a fine, or two-year jail sentence, if they failed to respond. Yet international human rights guidelines, enshrined into UK law last year in the Human Rights Act, guarantee the accuseds' right to silence should they fear incriminating themselves by talking. Mr Saunders' conviction was in 1996 ruled ""unsafe"" by the European Court of Human Rights, which last year issued the same verdict in cases bought by the rest of the Guinness Four. Further pressure from Mr Lyons saw the convictions of all four men referred to the UK Court of Appeals for this month's hearings. But while the four said the Human Right Act should apply retrospectively, appeal court judges on Friday cited a precedent rendering the point unarguable. In any case, ""there was and is substantial evidence against the appellants, quite apart from their compelled answers"", Lord Justice Rose said. The judges also rejected claims that the jury in the original trial may have been ""nobbled"", despite evidence from police informer Michael Michael, who helped earlier this month in the jailing of 34 people. So the Four who masterminded a remarkable takeover have proved less successful in achieving a legal coup. Not that financial regulators will mourn Friday's ruling. A decision in favour of the Four would have meant that after the two most significant UK fraud investigations of recent years - the Maxwell and Guinness affairs - not a single conviction would have stood."
289,"Revathi Massosai, the name by which she wants to be known, says she was forced to eat beef despite being a Hindu.  Miss Massosai was seized by the Islamic authorities in January when she went to court to ask that she be registered as a Hindu rather than a Muslim.  The case is one of a number that have raised religious tensions in Malaysia.  Miss Massosai was born to Muslim converts and given a Muslim name, but she was raised as a Hindu by her grandmother and has always practised that faith.  However, under Malaysia's Islamic law, having Muslim parents makes one a Muslim and, as such, one is not allowed to change one's faith or marry a non-Muslim.  But Miss Massosai married a Hindu man in 2004 and the couple have a young daughter.  When in January she asked a court to officially designate her a Hindu she was detained and taken to an Islamic rehabilitation centre.  Her detention was twice extended to six months, during which time she says religious officials tried to make her pray as a Muslim and wear a headscarf.  However, the claim that will particularly shock Hindus is that the camp authorities tried to force her to eat beef.  A lawyer representing the Malacca state Islamic department responsible for Miss Revathi's arrest, rejected her allegations and said officials believe that she can still be persuaded to embrace Islam.  She is adamant that she will remain a Hindu. In the meantime, Miss Revathi and her daughter have been placed in the custody of her Muslim parents."
290,"The zooplankton study has been launched by Cardiff University, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and Cardiff Harbour Authority (CHA).  David Lowe, of CHA said: ""Zooplankton are vital to sustaining the ecological balance in our freshwaters"".  They provide food to birds and fish in the bay's artificial lake.  Cardiff University PhD student Faye Merrix, who is involved in the research, said the work could prove to be significant.  ''This three-year project could point the way forward to controlling the algae in Cardiff's freshwater lake,"" she said.  Previous studies have looked at the environmental implications of changing from salt water to freshwater, following the creation of Cardiff Bay's £197m barrage in 1999.  It includes the impact on birds, flora and insect populations.  The CHA hopes to increase understanding of the relationship between zooplankton, the growth of algae and the impact on oxygen levels.  Mr Lowe added: ""Monitoring of zooplankton over time will not only assist our understanding in this area of Wales, but may provide useful data for future studies"".  Plankton is made up of tiny plants called phytoplankton and tiny animals called zooplankton.  One aspect researchers will look for is an increase in species such as Daphnia - water fleas which eat algal cells and could improve water clarity.  These creatures, which can grow up to 5mm, could also encourage plant growth.  Professor Steve Ormerod, of Cardiff University's school of biosciences said: ""Cardiff Bay is a unique water body of a type that we still know remarkably little about - for example how its species assemble and interact.  ""This project therefore represents a real opportunity to contribute internationally to new knowledge in aquatic ecology and conservation biology.""  Dr Steve Thackeray, from the CEH, added that it was an ""exciting project"" and was part of an attempt to ""generate solutions to today's pressing environmental issues""."
291,"Nearly five decades have passed since the UK's first out-of-town superstore opened its doors. It differed starkly from the outlets used by millions today, but it helped change British shopping forever.  They circle the nation's suburbs, giant caverns of consumerism piled high with bulk-bought perishables.  Plenty of people loathe them, but millions rely on them. Out-of-town superstores - bigger, uglier brothers of standard-sized supermarkets - are an inescapable part of the modern British landscape.  Ubiquitous as they may be today, however, it's less than half-a-century since the first such outlet in the UK was launched.  When the country's first large-scale edge-of-city superstore was launched in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, the British public had never seen anything like it.  This vast new building boasted 110,000 sq ft (10,200 sq m) of floor space. It sold a spectacular array of groceries, hardware, furniture and clothes all under one roof, and there were parking spaces for 1,000 cars.  It boasted some 50 departments, including a pharmacy, sports goods, records, a restaurant, toys, a hairdresser, shoe repairs and carpets. Its stock and shop fittings were reportedly worth £700,000 - a huge figure at the time.  Developments like this would later be blamed for crushing independent traders, emptying out High Streets and imposing a stultifying homogeneity on the nation's retail habits.  But at a time when most Britons did their shopping in the local grocer, and memories of wartime rationing were fresh, this huge vision of consumer abundance symbolised a new era of modern affluence to many.  On its opening weekend in November 1964, an estimated 30,000 people and 5,000 cars visited the store, causing traffic jams for miles around.  Carole Foote, who was 21 years old in 1964 when she first travelled across Nottingham to visit the newly opened West Bridgford retailer, recalls her father gazing upon the store with wonderment.  ""I can remember dad standing, looking, his face absolutely amazed. And he said, 'I think we're going to have a good time here.'""  It was operated by Gem International Supercentres Incorporated, a US-owned firm which hoped to bring American shopping habits to Britain.  Today a branch of Asda is located on its Nottinghamshire site, and few people are aware of the pivotal role it played in British retail history.  At the time, the progenitors of today's supermarkets had already made forays into the British shopping landscape.  Sainsbury's opened its first self-service store - where customers collected their own groceries in baskets, rather than queuing to order items from assistants standing behind counters - in Croydon, Surrey, in 1950, and the format spread to High Streets across the country.  But these were far from the vast warehouse-like retail units that dominate the modern landscape. The West Bridgford outlet was the first edge-of-town outlet, aimed at motorists and their families, on the kind of scale with which 21st Century customers would be familiar.  So novel was the concept that local newspapers didn't quite know what to call it.  ""A new American-style supercentre,"" one reporter described it. Another termed the edifice a ""shopping plaza"".  In its own publicity, however, Gem called it a ""one-stop one-level department store"".  The arrival of this American-style development was national news.  ""THE WINDOWLESS STORE MAKES ITS DEBUT,"" ran the headline in The Times.  The lack of plate glass required explanation to the consumers of 1964.  ""We need the wall space for our merchandise, and windows in general are out for the car shopper - he drives in, he stops at our parking lot, and he walks right out,"" Herman FE Trost, Gem's general manager of development, told the paper.  According to Phil Lyon, a retail historian at Queen Margaret University Edinburgh, this was perhaps the store's most enduring legacy.  ""Since the 1930s you had these impressive window displays - the shops had to create them to get people in the shop,"" he says.  Now in West Bridgford, however, there was no attempt to attract passing trade. Instead they would be invited to make a trip in their cars with a promise of bulk-bought produce and the cheapest petrol in the area.  ""Pretty soon, you never saw anything in supermarket windows apart from the odd poster,"" Lyon adds.  Today an outlet on this scale would take months, if not years, to gain approval from a local authority.  But although there had been objections from local traders fearful of the impact on trade, a public inquiry into the planning application had taken just three days.  It took nine months and £500,000 to build the supermarket and its car park.  However, at first the development was not a success. It would take Asda, a British firm, to make this most American of concepts work.  By November 1965, Gem was complaining of ""the innate conservative outlook, the ingrained prejudices of the trading community in this country"".  Barely two years after it opened, sales stood at a disappointing £6,000 a week. Gem sold its stake in the unit to a new partnership, the Leeds-based Asda.  In some ways the UK was not yet ready for the American-style retail experience. As late as 1967, just 47% of households owned refrigerators, compared with 90% in the US.  But ultimately Gem's British venture failed because the West Bridgford site was not yet a true supermarket as we would understand the concept today, says Paul Whysall, professor of retailing at Nottingham Business School.  ""It advertised itself as a department store and within that there were a number of franchises,"" he says.  Each of these franchises ran a different department within the store, he says. Shoppers were supposed to stay within colour-coded floor markings before paying for goods but were frequently confused by the system.  ""There was a problem with shoplifting,"" says Whysall. ""People didn't realise that they'd wandered from one department to another.""  Asda's owners wanted to create a large-scale, low-cost supermarket. It was also keen to take advantage of a recent law banning retail price maintenance, whereby shops were required by manufacturers to sell their products at a minimum price or above.  In came a superstore on the scale never before seen in the UK.  The emphasis was on low prices. Bigger volumes meant customers could be charged less. Some food lines were 17% cheaper than those offered by competitors.  In its first week of operating the store, Asda made £30,000. Six months later, sales had doubled.  Chris Stockdale, son of Asda co-founder Noel Stockdale, says that what happened at West Bridgford transformed the retail industry.  ""It provided our customers with the opportunity to buy most of their household needs at very competitive prices,"" he says. ""It really was part of a shopping revolution.""  This new system reflected the pace of social change.  With women increasingly going out to work, families could not depend on housewives traipsing round High Streets every day to buy that evening's meal. Thanks to the increasing presence of the refrigerator in their homes, many were now doing a weekly rather than a daily shop.  The modern superstore - on the edge of town, surrounded by parking spaces, selling a huge range of low-cost produce in bulk - was born.  It was not a development that was universally popular. Asda was accused of damaging trade in the centre of Nottingham, and other chains that followed suit across the country have faced similar accusations ever since.  According to Whysall, the small town of West Bridgford itself was not too badly affected, however. The 10 stores on its main parade have remained more or less continuously occupied since Gem's arrival, he says, although their businesses have changed over time - the grocer, hardware shop and draper disappearing to make way for a Thai restaurant, a betting shop and a laundrette.  If Gem did not dramatically change West Bridgford itself, the superstore undoubtedly helped shape modern Britain.

292,"The Netherlands' bid to qualify for Euro 2016 ended in failure as Robin van Persie scored an own goal in a home defeat by the 10-man Czech Republic.  The Dutch needed to win and for Iceland to beat Turkey to earn a play-off spot, but Van Persie's error saw them go 3-0 down despite Mark Suchy seeing red.  Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Van Persie replied to goals from Pavel Kaderabek and Josef Sural but instead it was Turkey who secured third place.  Turkey had Gokhan Tore dismissed in the 78th minute as their match appeared to be heading for a draw, but Selcuk Inan's last-minute goal saw them claim a dramatic victory.  That result means Turkey qualify for next summer's tournament in France as the highest ranked third-placed team out of all nine qualifying groups.  Ukraine and Norway both finished third in their respective groups and had more points than Turkey.  But results against the sides finishing bottom in their respective groups do not count - leaving Turkey with the most points.  ""As a country we really needed this win to feel happy, even for a few hours maybe,"" said Terim.  ""We are so happy to have offered some happiness to our people.""  Netherlands coach Danny Blind took over at the start of July after Guus Hiddink left after 10 months in the position.  He has lost three of his four matches in charge but says he has ""no intention"" of stepping down.  ""I'm going to carry on with my work because I'm under contract until 2018 and I believe in this team,"" Blind added.  ""I haven't achieved my goal. The aim was to qualify automatically or via the play-offs and I haven't done that.  ""Am I the one to blame? I now have to analyse that. The results weren't good.""  Against the Czechs, Van Persie's cushioned header past his own goalkeeper was the low point - and seemed to spark a reaction from the home side as they scored twice in quick succession afterwards.  But they still failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage, with Suchy having been dismissed for a last-man tackle on Manchester United forward Memphis Depay late in the first half.  The Netherlands, who finished third at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, were crowned European champions in 1988 and were third in 1992, 2000 and 2004.  The last time they failed to qualify for a major tournament was the 2002 World Cup. Before that, they were absent from the 1982 and 1986 tournaments and from the 1984 European Championship."
293,"Helsinki airport had 188cm (6ft) of snow last winter but the last time it was forced to close because of the weather was in 2003.  That closure lasted for half an hour.  This winter planes have been taking off and landing as normal despite an unusually heavy snowfall in December - 65cm (more than two feet).  It looks as though there will be another snowy winter, like last year's, says Annika Kala, a spokesperson for the airport. But she says she's relaxed because the airport is ""well prepared"".  The preparation consists of good equipment, extra winter staff, and a choice of three runways.  While one runway is being cleared of snow or ice, the other two are open for business.  In exceptional circumstances, two runways may be closed. It takes a rare combination of heavy snow and high wind to close all three - as happened, briefly, seven years ago.  What about the equipment?  ""We have 250 vehicles of different kinds,"" says Ms Kala.  ""We have sweepers, snow ploughs, vehicles that blow snow from the runways, and friction testers that check the surface is fit for use.""  The snow is removed to a special storage area within the airport perimeter. When that fills up, it is taken to other facilities outside.  Last winter 7,000 truckloads were carted off the runways, apron and taxi-ing areas.  Temperatures in Helsinki can drop to -25C (-13F) - but Ms Kala explains that a good hard frost is much easier to deal with than a temperature of zero or -1C.  ""When it's zero degrees, it's moist and there will be ice,"" she says.  ""We have to take the ice away. We first use metal brushes, then, if necessary, we use chemicals.""  The extra seasonal staff, about 50 of them, operate this equipment.  But there is also a dedicated ""snow desk"" that keeps in contact with the airlines, the ground handling team and air traffic control.  ""They plan how much staff we need, how many vehicles - and they follow weather forecasts hour by hour,"" Ms Kala says.  She acknowledges that there is a big difference between Helsinki, which has a total of 600 landings and take-offs per day on its three runways, and Heathrow which has twice as many - on two runways - and five times as many passengers to deal with.  Running a big airport like Heathrow - which is privately owned by BAA - would be a bigger operation than running state-owned Helsinki airport.  But the principles for dealing with snow and ice, Ms Kala suggests, are probably the same."
294,"Kewell, 27, limped out after 23 minutes but has now told the Daily Mirror: ""Everybody thought I had thrown it in.  ""I could not believe the reaction from some people. I did not realise there were so many qualified doctors watching the match. My groin just snapped.  ""Some were saying my heart wasn't in it or I just wanted to go off.""  Kewell was replaced by Vladimir Smicer and did not play again until he turned out for Liverpool's reserves on 27 September.  But the Australia international, who has a long history of injury problems, was unhappy with the way people jumped to conclusions.  ""Even before the story was out properly they had diagnosed me and decided I had quit,"" he added.  ""Do people know I was the number one penalty taker on the pitch that night in Istanbul?  ""So why would I want to walk off in a game when I had a real chance of getting on the scoresheet?"""
295,"The teams, all supplied by Michelin, had been found guilty of two charges.  But a statement from Formula One's governing body the FIA said its World Motor Sport Council had voted ""overwhelmingly"" to clear all seven.  The decision appears to be the result of evidence that they could have faced criminal proceedings if they had raced.  The FIA statement said: ""Having examined new evidence, the FIA World Motor Sport Council has voted overwhelmingly to accept the recommendation of the FIA Senate regarding events at the 2005 United States Grand Prix.  The teams involved were Renault, McLaren, Toyota, Williams, Red Bull, Sauber and BAR.  They were found guilty of failing to ensure they had suitable tyres and wrongfully refusing to start the race at last month's US Grand Prix.  The Michelin-equipped teams withdrew after the formation lap at Indianapolis because the French company said it could not guarantee the safety of the tyres through the final high-speed banked corner.  Following the guilty verdict, McLaren team boss Ron Dennis and Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner met president Max Mosley and the FIA senate.  ""Nobody came out of Indianapolis with anything positive and perpetuating the negatives was clearly not constructive to Formula One,"" said Dennis.  ""I am delighted that the senate and the world council have held that way too.""  Minardi boss Paul Stoddart, whose Bridgestone-equipped team did take part in the race, said the verdict was good for everyone.  ""The most important thing out of all of this is that Formula One is a sport and we need to get on with the sport,"" he said.  ""It was the right decision and I am glad it was made now. Hopefully we can put that chapter of Formula One behind us and move on."""
296,"The fire started in the living room of the Buckinghamshire home late at night.  Black Sabbath star Ozzy and X-Factor judge Sharon were roused by a fire alarm and ran to safety in the garden, rescuing their pets as they escaped.  The couple were not injured in the fire, which happened on Good Friday, but were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation.  Two fire engines turned up at the home and four firefighters wearing breathing apparatus went inside to douse the flames.  Fire chiefs believe the cause may have been electrical. The extent of the fire was not immediately clear but it is believed to have caused damage running into thousands of pounds.  On Wednesday fire officers visited the couple to give them safety advice.  The blaze is the latest in a series of blows for the MTV reality show stars.  Last November the couple were burgled at the Chalfont St Peter mansion, with an estimated £2m-worth of jewellery stolen.  Eleven months before the burglary Ozzy had suffered a near-fatal crash on a quad bike."
297,"Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which controls much of Somalia, has released a joint video with al-Qaeda, announcing the two groups have merged.  Al-Shabab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, known as Mukhtar Abu Zubair, said he ""pledged obedience"" to al-Qaeda head Ayman al-Zawahiri.  The two groups have long worked together and foreigners are known to fight alongside Somali militants.  The announcement comes as al-Shabab is under pressure on several fronts.  Africa Union troops supporting the forces of the UN-backed government have taken control of the capital, Mogadishu, while both Kenya and Ethiopia have sent forces into Somalia to push back the Islamists.  Al-Shabab, however, still controls many southern and central areas of the country.  However, correspondents say al-Shabab's policy of banning many foreign aid agencies from areas it controls during the region's worst drought in 60 years has lost the group some of its popular support.  The United Nations says that although the famine in Somalia is officially over, a third of the population still needs urgent feeding.  BBC Somali editor Yusuf Garaad Omar says the merger of al-Shabab and al-Qaeda has the potential to change the dynamics of the conflict in Somalia.  During the 15-minute Arabic-language video posted on jihadist websites, Zawahiri said the move was ""good news"" for al-Qaeda.  Analysts say the announcement helps boost al-Qaeda after its leader Osama Bin Laden was killed last year.  ""Al-Qaeda needs to project power and influence, particularly given its own operational impotence,"" Australian analyst Leah Farrall told Reuters news agency.  ""Al-Shabab's acceptance under the al-Qaeda umbrella probably came with permission from Zawahiri for the group to launch external operations against the West.""  This week, the London-based Royal United Services Institute think-tank warned that about 50 Britons were training with al-Shabab and could return to attack the UK.  Last week, William Hague was also in Mogadishu, the first visit by a British foreign secretary in 20 years.  The UK government is holding a conference in London on 23 February to try to find a political solution to Somalia's problems, and tackle piracy and extremism.  Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991 and since then, has been convulsed by conflict."
298,"The Cheadle MP had presided over the most marginal seat in the UK until she was returned to Parliament on 5 May with a greatly increased majority.  She was last seen at Westminster on Tuesday when she arrived in a wheelchair to take her oath.  Party leader Charles Kennedy described Ms Calton as a ""spirited and courageous"" politician.  He said: ""I wish to extend my most profound sympathies and condolences to the family and friends of the late Patsy Calton following her death.  ""In particular all our thoughts are with her husband Clive and their children.  ""Patsy was a spirited and courageous MP, and nowhere was that spirit and commitment more evident than in the way she continued to represent Cheadle throughout the recurrence of her illness during the general election campaign, and most movingly when only last week she took her oath in the House of Commons.  ""Despite her desperate illness, her determination shone through.  ""Cheadle has lost a wonderful constituency MP and the Liberal Democrats have lost a fine representative of our cause.""  Ms Calton won her seat with a majority of about 4,000 despite defeated Conservative MP Stephen Day trying to win it back.  She was unable to attend the count at Stockport Town Hall due to cancer treatment.  Liberal Democrats president Simon Hughes said: ""This is a real tragedy, Patsy I've known for many years.  ""I was born in the seat she came to represent, she had lived there for many years with her family.  ""She became not just the MP for Cheadle... but she became a true community MP.  ""In her last days, fighting against cancer, she refused to give in, she said 'other people have to fight, I'm not going to give in just because I'm a politician'.""  He said there was ""no greater recent model of political courage"" than Ms Calton.  Francis Maude, Conservative Party chairman, also paid tribute to Ms Calton, who he said was ""highly regarded by people from every party"".  ""Despite her illness she campaigned tirelessly for cancer charities,"" he said.  ""Everyone will have been moved and inspired by the courage with which she fought her long illness, and everyone who saw it will remember her appearance in the House of Commons recently. Our sympathies are with her family at this very difficult time."""
299,"It was conceived as a vision of the future for Northern Ireland, but the reality has been described as ""fundamentally flawed"".  The new town of Craigavon was created in County Armagh in the 1960s to realise all the aspirations of Modernist architecture and town planning.  The dream quickly turned sour and the reality was a ""soulless"" urban space notorious for its many roundabouts.  The story of Craigavon has now come full circle and a new exhibition has opened to detail its history.  Curator of the exhibition, Rebekah McCabe, said: ""In terms of vision, Craigavon during the 1960s embodied every value of British Modernism.  ""Its innovative and risky housing design drew inspiration from around the world, rejecting indigenous housing styles and embracing modern European aesthetics.  ""This exhibition reveals the bright ambitions of the project and how its origins were part of Prime Minister Terence O'Neill's vision of a modern Northern Ireland in the 1960s, where town planning concepts included recreation zones, mixed housing, cycle paths and roundabouts.""  Named after Northern Ireland's first prime minister, Lord Craigavon, many felt the town was created for the Protestant community.  Dr Stephen McKay, director of education at the School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering at Queen's University in Belfast, said: ""The Craigavon brand was fundamentally and fatally flawed from the outset. Naming it after the first unionist prime minister was perhaps an unwise opening move in terms of achieving cross-community buy-in.""  Grants were offered to encourage people to relocate to Craigavon from Belfast.  Dr McKay said: ""Belfast had been expanding at a fearful rate to the detriment of the rest of the country and, consequently, constraining its expansion and developing new growth centres should have been a good idea. However, many believe that the selection of Craigavon was perverse, and the inevitable impact was to divert resources away from other needy locations in the west, particularly Derry.""  The exhibition also recalls the displacement of farming families who had to move out of the area between Lurgan and Portadown when construction began.  Dr McKay said: ""In terms of the built environment many problems emerged in the big housing estates as a result of using untested methods and materials.  ""Closure of the infamous Goodyear Tyre plant, which provided a huge amount of employment, hit the emerging community like a torpedo.  ""The cycle ways, mixed housing and recreational zones were really never going to work in light of the circumstances. The manifestation of Craigavon to many was effectively a series of roundabouts.""  Ms McCabe said: ""Today it feels like Craigavon has come full circle, with new developments springing up everywhere and people not just from Northern Ireland but from all over the world moving there. It's a very progressive place to live.""  Dr McKay agreed: ""Things may be far from perfect, but in my opinion, the planning service deserves tremendous credit for turning things around as well as it has.""  The exhibition, Craigavon New Town: 50 Years of Modernity, is on at the Golden Thread Gallery, Belfast from 24 October until Saturday, 1 November.  The Ulster Museum was screening the film, The Lost City of Craigavon, on Saturday, 25 October.  A bus tour of Craigavon guided by Rebekah McCabe will take a journey through the city's history on Saturday, 1 November."

301,"The rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army have thought long and hard about whether they should attend peace talks in Paris at the weekend.  For now, though, the killing goes on and it has taken a new turn with a spate of terrorist attacks on bars and cafes in the capital, Pristina.  ""Not many Serbs can you now find after three pm or four pm. Nobody travels during the night because people are scared. The KLA is again on the roads.""  At lunchtime in an Albanian bar I visited it is busy but, at night, it is a different story. Like the Serbs, many Albanians dare not venture out after dark.  One Albanian resident, Linda Gusia told me: ""It's terrifying because it's different when you go and fight with a gun and it's different when you die drinking coffee. It's really stupid when you die drinking coffee. It's terrifying. You don't feel safe anywhere. You have this feeling of insecurity wherever you go.""  Until recently, most of this conflict has been confined to the countryside but in the capital Pristina there is a palpable sense of fear that it, too, could be engulfed in the fighting if the peace talks fail.  For the residents of the city, the ultimate nightmare is that their hometown could become another Sarajevo."
302,"Hundreds of protesters have attacked a bus station in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, setting fire to a bus and destroying cash and ticket machines.  Riot police responded with tear gas and at least six people were arrested.  Protesters were demanding free public transport. High transport costs triggered protests in Sao Paulo in June that later spread across Brazil.  The clashes came as President Dilma Rousseff announced a plan to improve public transport in the city.  Friday's protests began with a march through the city that lasted about three hours.  Violence erupted when a section of the crowd broke off and attacked a bus terminal in the city centre, police said.  Masked protesters, said to include members of the so-called Black Bloc anarchist group, set light to a bus and vandalised cash machines and ticket turnstiles.  At one point a police colonel was struck by a rock and had to be rescued by fellow officers, Brazil's O Globo newspaper reported.  As police moved in, protesters fled, setting up barricades in some parts of the city centre.  On Friday, President Rousseff announced a $2.4bn (£1.5bn) plan to improve public transport in Sao Paulo.  The money will be invested in urban train lines and subway expansion including a new line to link the city's airport to Sao Paulo's eastern zone.  ""The republic and the state government have a common co-ordinated action to attack the most serious problems that we have in our largest cities, one of which is urban mobility,"" said Ms Rousseff.  Although June's protests were triggered by transport costs, wider unrest has been targeted at Brazil's rising cost of living, poor public services, corruption and the misuse of government money.  Earlier this month, a march by thousands of teachers in Rio de Janeiro demanding a pay rise was hijacked by anarchists who set fire to banks and other buildings.  Continuing street protests are causing concern ahead of the 2014 World Cup that Brazil will host in a few months time."
303,"The NHS faces unrelenting pressure despite funding rising. Why?  The sheer scale of the NHS can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world.  Last year £140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago.  And that's after you adjust it for inflation.  Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every £1 spent on services goes on health.  Even during the years of deep austerity, extra money has been found for the health service - £8bn more this Parliament in England alone.  Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams.  The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack.  Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital.  Which local services are under threat?  When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours.  But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year.  The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering around the 90% mark in recent weeks.  The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now.  This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more.  But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two.  The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much.  As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at £20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this.  Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly.  All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy.  This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending.  Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse.  But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give.  Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was closer to 7%.  As you can see the period since 2010 has seen the tightest financial settlements. What is more, the spending squeeze is continuing during this Parliament at almost exactly the same rate, even with England's extra £8bn going in.  Ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got.  Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population.  But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy.  The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders.  But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC this week is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up.  Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do.  But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts.  Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all.  There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare.  The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s.  But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community.  The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult.  The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by a third in 12 years.  Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition.  There are attempts to change this. To place more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less.  But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital.  In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state.  However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves.  The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at £60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes.  But none of them has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done?  Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils? Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other?  Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention?  But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do."
304,"Out of the wreckage of the old Yugoslavia a new union is currently being formed between Serbia and Montenegro. This act of creation is a sign that a great experiment in the 'land of the south Slavs' (which is what Yugoslavia means) is finally over. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. This decision in Belgrade's federal parliament to create a new loose union between the two republics, called simply Serbia and Montenegro, and to finally consign the name of Yugoslavia to history, shows how the legislators have bowed to reality. The real Yugoslavia perished in the 1990s, during the wars that consumed it. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. Its proponents thought that south Slavs, that is to say people with much in common, especially their languages, who lived in a great arc of territory from the borders of Austria almost to the gates of Constantinople (now Istanbul), should unite and form one great strong south Slav state. Ideas for a union of the southern Slavs had begun circulating at least as early as the 1840s. In the regions that were to become part of modern Croatia, thinkers dreamed of a new Illyria - a name harking back to the days of the Roman Empire. Amongst Serbs, however, such notions were less prevalent. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. Dreams of a union, state or empire came easily to the lands of the south Slavs because all of the people who lived in what was to become Yugoslavia were then the subjects of others. And the fault-lines of empire divided the south Slavs from one another. By 1912, however, the first of the wars that were to convulse this region periodically throughout the 20th century was about to begin. Two small Serbian and Montenegrin states had already emerged and become independent - having shaken off the Ottoman Turkish yoke - but the rest of what was to become Yugoslavia was still part of either the Ottoman or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. With the first Balkan war of 1912 all that began to change. The new small states of Serbia and Montenegro, fighting alongside Greece and Bulgaria, managed to push the Turks back to Constantinople. Serbia and Montenegro conquered Kosovo, and Serbia took a large share of Macedonia. For many Serbs and other Slavs living within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Serbia was their champion. Inspired, and also helped, by Serbia's secret services, one of these young radicals took a pot-shot at the heir to throne of Austro-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand, who was visiting Bosnia on 28 June 1914.  Within months the old order was gone. The assassination in Sarajevo sparked off World War One, which in its wake destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Empire. What was to replace it? Many Croat, Serb and other south Slav soldiers remained loyal to Austria-Hungary during the war, but there were also some who did not. Indeed, some of its politicians feared that as Austria-Hungary crumbled Italy would seize as much of the coast of Dalmatia as it could, while Serbia would create a new greatly enlarged Serbian state, including Bosnia and parts of what are now Croatia - especially those areas that were then heavily inhabited by Serbs. The politicians felt that a deal must be reached with Serbia. A new union was to be proclaimed. The Serbian Army would save Croatia and Slovenia from the territorial ambitions of the Italians, and union would also save Croatia from Serbia itself. The kingdom was formed on 1 December 1918. Serbia's royal family, the Karadjordjevics, became that of the new country, which was officially called the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929 - when it became Yugoslavia. The country was carved up. Immediately it became clear that the union was not a happy one. Many Croats especially resented it, because they felt they had exchanged the domination of Vienna for that of Serbian Belgrade. Kosovo's Albanian population was restive too. Albanians were not Slavs and were bitter that Kosovo had not been able to join the newly independent Albania (which proclaimed its independence in 1912). Macedonian nationalists also resented the new state. So Yugoslavia lurched from crisis to crisis until finally it collapsed, with barely a fight, in 1941 - when attacked by Nazi Germany and Mussolini's fascist Italy. The country was carved up. A tiny extreme fascist quisling clique, known as the Ustashas, was installed in power in the Croatian capital Zagreb. They began a campaign of terror and genocide directed especially at the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia. Resistance soon began to emerge. In Serbia so-called Chetnik forces loyal to the old Serbian-dominated Yugoslav order began to fight, and so did a communist dominated resistance under the half-Slovene half-Croat Josip Broz - also known as Tito.  The war years were a nightmare of inter-ethnic bloodletting, fighting and wars within wars. While Yugoslavia was occupied and resistance was directed against the occupiers, in fact the majority of those who died, did so in fighting between nationalists of various stripes - royalists, communists, quislings and so on. Tito's forces, however, soon gained the recognition and help of the Allies. They also offered an ideal - a dream of 'brotherhood and unity' - that would link the nations or peoples of Yugoslavia. By 1945 Tito's forces were victorious, and crucially, although the Soviet Red Army had helped in the struggle, it had now moved on to central Europe. So Tito, not Moscow, would shape the new state. But Tito was a communist, loyal to Stalin. He wanted to model his country on the Soviet Union, so a federal state of six republics was proclaimed (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia). Stalin was wary of Tito, however, and in 1948 the two fell out. Yugoslavia was expelled from the communist bloc but Tito did not fall from power, as many had expected. He survived, and began to chart an independent course for the nation he ruled. Over the next 40 years Yugoslavia changed beyond recognition. It developed its own brand of socialism, and a society far more open than that of its communist neighbours. For them, and for many communists around the world, Yugoslavia seemed to be a paradise on earth. At home the federation appeared to have solved the bitter national questions of the past, living standards were high and, unlike in other communist countries, citizens were free to travel to the west, either to work or to take holidays. Tito's Yugoslavia also gained enormous prestige as a founder of the non-aligned movement, which aimed to find a place in world politics for countries that did not want to stand foursquare behind either of the two superpowers. Even liberal communism had its limits... Despite all this, and although there was much substance to Tito's Yugoslavia, much was illusion too. The economy was built on the shaky foundations of massive western loans. Even liberal communism had its limits, as did the very nature of the federation. Stirrings of nationalist dissent in Croatia and Kosovo were crushed. The federation worked because in reality the voice of only one man counted - that of Tito himself.  When Tito died in 1980, Yugoslavs were shocked and apprehensive. They had been prepared for his demise with the slogan 'After Tito - Tito'. But there was no new Tito. Without him the state began to unravel, as the governments of the republics began to exercise the powers that were due to them under the constitution. Dissent began to grow. Serbs complained of persecution at the hands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Croats and Slovenes resented the fact that money earned from tourists in their republics went to subsidise poorer parts of Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo. Albanians there demonstrated for their own republic, and even for secession and union with Albania. ...by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. Managing these strains and crises was hard enough, but by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. And if it was, what was to replace it? For Slobodan Milosevic, an up-and-coming politician in Serbia, the answer was nationalism. Seizing on the delicate issue of Kosovo, Milosevic came to supreme power. And so, Yugoslavia began to crumble. In 1989 Milosevic abolished Kosovo's autonomy. Croats and Slovenes feared that they were next in line. In this way a spiral of competitive and mutually fearful nationalisms began to destroy the country. Politicians fanned the embers of all the old divisions - Serbs versus Croats, Orthodox Christians versus Catholics versus Muslims, and so on. Milosevic clearly wanted to dominate all of the old Yugoslavia, but when he realised that he could not, he switched to another option, that of a Greater Serbia. History had scattered the Serbs especially, well outside the borders of Serbia. Milosevic argued that the federation meant that nations could secede from it, but not republics. So, he said, Slovenia - with no indigenous minorities - and Croatia could leave Yugoslavia if they wished - but then Croatia could not take its Serb areas with it. The stage was set for war. The stage was set for war. The story of those conflicts in Slovenia, in Croatia, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and finally NATO's war in Yugoslavia, has been told many times.  Now, prosperous Slovenia is looking forward to EU and NATO membership. Croatia is recovering from war, and its territory is intact, although most of its Serbs have fled or been driven out. Bosnia is divided into two, a shattered land still struggling to overcome the legacy of the war. Macedonia has been riven by ethnic conflict - but spared all-out war - between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians returned to Kosovo after the war there, but then 230,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians were forced to flee. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. Serbia and Montenegro have been impoverished by the wars and even today - as their new union is being formed - their future state is far from assured. Serbs and Montenegrins have much in common, especially their common Orthodox heritage, but Serbia is a land of some eight million people, and Montenegro has only 650,000 citizens. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. The new deal is for a loose union for three years, after which either republic can opt for independence. On paper it is a sensible compromise. In reality it will be hard, but not impossible, to make it work - if there is enough goodwill. The new deal, however, makes no provision for Kosovo, a UN protectorate since 1999, but still nominally part of Yugoslavia - or now its successor state. Its majority Albanian population has no intention of ever entering any new union with Belgrade, while its Serbs have no intention of permitting it to take the path of independence. If they can't prevent independence they (and the policymakers in Belgrade), would probably like to partition it, with the northern Serbian inhabited areas staying within Serbia. So, the final disintegration of the old Yugoslav state is not yet complete. Having taken their different paths, the people of the former Yugoslavia will look back on the past with different and mixed emotions. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country, and in Serbia and Montenegro most people are simply too exhausted by the conflicts of the past and the difficulties of life to really care. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country... But throughout the old Yugoslavia, and especially amongst those who grew up under Tito (except perhaps the Kosovo Albanians), the passing of its name will leave many with a wistful feeling - a feeling for which, indeed, they already have a name: Yugonostalgia."
305,"Train companies must stop dumping human waste from toilets on railway tracks, a transport minister has said.  Lady Kramer branded the practice ""utterly disgusting"" and called on the industry to take action.  The RMT rail union is also demanding action, saying it is a potential health hazard for track workers.  The train companies said carriages without toilet tanks were being phased out and it was not often an issue raised by passengers or workers.  Modern trains are fitted with toilet tanks, which are pumped out at the depot when they become full.  But older rolling stock, which is still running on many of Britain's busiest routes, still discharges sewage directly on to the track.  Former Conservative minister Baroness Wilcox raised the issue as the House of Lords debated the 20th anniversary of rail privatisation.  ""I am very sorry to see that still we have raw sewage going out on to the lines,"" she told peers.  ""It is a terrible thing to see after all these years since November 5, 1993 that we should still be doing that.""  She asked Lady Kramer: ""Before we rush forward to HS2, which I am looking forward to enormously, I would like to urge you to think about the men working on the lines and working in the stations who are having to deal with this excrement.""  The Lib Dem minister replied: ""The comments you make totally resonate. This is just utterly disgusting and I think it does speak to the fact that customer service has not always been at the centre of railways because customers I think are very concerned about this issue.""  She said InterCity 125 trains would be replaced from 2017 by new models which would solve the problem.  But she added: ""It is a tougher issue on the local diesel trains which are gradually going out of service and we could indeed use some help from the industry in trying to tackle that problem.""  The RMT rail union claims parts of the rail network, such as stretches of the the East Coast Mainline, are ""like an open sewer"" and it was a frequent source of complaints from workers.  RMT General Secretary Bob Crow said: ""It really is a shocking indictment on the state of our railways 20 years after privatisation, and with hundreds of millions of pounds a year being creamed off in private profits, that raw sewage is still being dumped on the tracks up and down the UK.  ""Not only is it a filthy way of disposing of effluent, but it also poses real health risks and dangers for RMT members out there working on the tracks.  ""It should be stopped and the train companies should be the ones who pay the price for upgrading the trains and employing staff to empty the tanks.""  The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train companies and Network Rail, said the issue did not come up in a bi-annual national passenger survey and it was not often raised as an issue by staff.  A spokesperson said: ""The majority of rail carriages that have toilets are fitted with tanks and the number of older carriages which are not will fall further in the next few years as new InterCity trains are introduced.  ""The industry is always listening to customers and has spent millions of pounds on installing and improving passenger toilet facilities.  ""Train companies and Network Rail also take their duty of care towards staff very seriously and ensure that depot and trackside teams are given the right training, equipment and protective clothing for their roles."""
306,"Thirteen of the men were convicted of carrying out bomb attacks on the destroyer USS Cole in 2000 and the French tanker Limburg in 2002.  The men broke out of a jail in the city of Sanaa and ""are considered among the most important and dangerous members of al-Qaeda"", an official told agency AFP.  He said they tunnelled 140 metres which took them to a nearby mosque.  The men then escaped as people left the mosque after Friday prayers.  The source said Fawaz al-Rabihi, who was convicted for the attack on the Limburg who had been sentenced to death, and Jamal al-Badawi, who received 10 years for the attack on the USS Cole were among those who escaped .  Al-Qaeda's Yemeni number two Abu Assem al-Ahdal may also be among those on the loose, the security source was quoted by AFP.  Yemen, which is the ancestral home of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, has been an ally of the US-led war on terror since the September 11 attacks in 2001.  Seventeen US sailors were killed when two suicide bombers blew themselves up on an inflatable raft moored next to USS Cole in the southern Yemeni port of Aden in October 2000.  In October 2002, the French tanker Limburg, was attacked off Yemen's south-eastern coast. An explosion killed one Bulgarian crew member and wounded 12 others."
307,"Prso has confirmed that persistent knee problems have forced his retirement from international football after representing Croatia at the World Cup.  And he told the Sportske Novosti daily: ""I'm 32, my knee is in bad shape and the end of my soccer career is near.""  He has a year left of his contract and added: ""I'll sit down then with my family and see what is best for me.""  Prso, as he had been last season, again looked Rangers major threat as they defeated Middlesbrough in a pre-season friendly on Saturday, setting up the only goal of the game for Thomas Buffel.  But the summer was not a happy one for the striker, with Croatia being knocked out in the group stages in Germany.  And Prso, who scored nine goals in 29 international appearances, said it ""was the biggest disappointment in my life"".  ""I wanted to say goodbye to the team with style, not that way,"" he said.  Croatia national federation head Vlatko Markovic had travelled to Glasgow in an attempt to persuade Prso to continue his international career.  But Prso insisted: ""I had to retire some time and I have decided that that moment has come.""  Prso made his debut in the national squad in a March 2003 European Championship qualifier against Belgium.  Croatia won 4-0, with Prso scoring two of the goals to confirm that he was the natural successor to the retired Davor Suker.  He had left Croatia in 1994, during the 1991-95 Serbo-Croatian war, for France and has since played for Rouen, St Raphael, Ajaccio, Monaco and Rangers."
308,"Dubai-based airline Emirates has become the first commercial airline to allow passengers to make mobile phone calls during flights.  Emirates said the first permitted mobile phone call was made on a flight between Dubai and Casablanca.  The aircraft, an Airbus A340, is fitted with a system which stops mobiles from interfering with a plane's electronics.  Emirates plans to extend the system to more aircraft and later this year add BlackBerry and other data services.  According to the airline, the mobile service will only be activated when the aircraft is at cruising altitude and the cabin crew will be able to monitor and control the use of the system.  Passengers will be able to receive and send text messages, but the crew will be able to prevent voice calls at certain times, such as during night flights.  Passengers will also be requested to keep their phones on ""silent"" mode, said the airline.  Emirates said it decided to introduce the use of mobile phones in its fleet after experiencing high demand for the phones already installed in aircraft seats.  The airline had to obtain approval from international air safety organisations before adopting the system, which was developed by the AeroMobile company.  ""We have gone to considerable lengths to ensure that all safety and regulatory issues have been fully addressed"", said AeroMobile Chief Executive Bjorn-Taale Sandberg.  Emirates flies to more than 60 countries and is owned by the government of Dubai.     "
309,"Ninety-five percent of the United States' fresh water is underground. One crucial source is a huge underground reservoir, the 800-mile Ogallala aquifer which stretches from Texas to South Dakota and waters one fifth of US irrigated land.  The aquifer was formed over millions of years, but has since been cut off from its original natural sources. It is being depleted at a rate of 12 billion cubic metres a year  amounting to a total depletion to date of a volume equal to the annual flow of 18 Colorado Rivers. Some estimates say it will dry up in as little as 25 years.  Many farmers in the Texan High Plains, which rely particularly on the underground source, are now turning away from irrigated agriculture as they become aware of the hazards of overpumping."
310,"James Hewitt, former lover of Diana, Princess of Wales, has said he is prepared to sell her love letters.  In an interview for the American television network, CNN, the former army officer said he would part with the letters for the right price.  He described them as important historical documents that should be preserved for the future.  The British Library has responded by expressing an interest in gaining the 64 letters for its collection of royal manuscripts.  Dr Christopher Wright, head of manuscripts, said: ""The British Library would be an ideal repository for the correspondence of the late Princess of Wales.""  But it is unlikely Mr Hewitt would give them away freely to a museum.  He said he has already been offered £4m for the intimate hand-written notes and defended his right to bargain a price.  ""I'm not being hypocritical about this, I'm being honest,"" he told CNN's Larry King.  He said that ideally the intimate correspondence, written between 1989 and 1991, would go to a private collector or a museum.  ""I think it's important to understand that they are or will become important historical documents,"" he added.  He denied that he had betrayed the princess and that he was ""utterly faithful"" to her when she was alive.  ""There's nothing to be ashamed about in the letters,"" he said.  He was asked whether he would consider donating the letters to the British Museum, for example, or give the money he got for them to charity.  He would not say what he would do with the money and brushed aside the suggestion about giving away the letters to a museum or Diana's sons.  The princess admitted her affair with the major during a BBC Panorama interview.  She said he had been a ""great friend to her at a difficult time"".  But she admitted she had been ""devastated"" when Hewitt co-operated with Anna Pasternak's book Princess in Love about their relationship in 1994 because of the effect on her children.  He was asked how he felt about the effect of the letters becoming public on Princes William and Harry.  He said they were ""well written and loving"", ""nothing to be ashamed of"" and not salacious.  His decision to sell the letters was criticised by the Duchess of York who was a guest on the show on Wednesday.  ""Betrayal, I think is the most horrible, horrible, disloyal thing you can do to anyone,"" she said."
311,"Our family has tried, over the years, to pull together information about Fred Birks. His life and the manner of his death has had a significant impact on the family, particularly on my father (also named Fred Birks). We would like to share the information that we have with as many people as possible, hence putting it on this BBC website. This was a remarkable young man whose story deserves to be preserved. If there is any additional information that people might have wed be absolutely delighted to hear from them.    Fred Birks was born on 31st August 1894 in Buckley, Flintshire (North Wales) - son of Samuel and Mary Birks (nee Williams). Samuel Birks was born 24th January 1852 and died 10th November 1899, following a pit accident at the Elm Colliery in Buckley. He married Mary Williams on 29th December 1877. Mary died on 25th December 1917, not long after hearing of Freds death. Samuel and Mary had 6 children Emily, Beatrice, Martha, Samuel, Fred and John. This was Samuels second marriage, his previous wife Ann Dodd, having died. There was 1 child from this first marriage, George Henry.    The family lived at Garden Cottage, Lane End, Buckley. Life would not have been easy for the family, Freds father died when he was just 5 years old and his mother had to care for her six children alone.     As a boy Fred attended St. Matthews Church of England School in Buckley for eleven years without being absent or late, for this he was awarded a silver medal and a Bible by Flintshire County Council. From all accounts he was an adventurous boy, involved in and good at sports, particularly boxing and football. Boxing classes were taken by the Curate at St Matthews, his nickname was Kit Kat. Stories about Fred describe someone who was a natural leader. He was a keen member of the Church Lads Brigade and the earliest surviving photograph of him is with the Brigade. In the photo (see attached) he is standing in the centre of the group immediately behind the Reverend Raymond Pelly, who wears an Officer's cap.    Buckley was very much part of an industrial area with the Brick Works, Mines and nearby Steel Mill dominating the town's economy. At the age of fourteen Fred left school to work in the steelworks of John Summers and Sons, Shotton. His strong physique and character led to early advancement to Steel Rollerman, a well paid job requiring strength and dexterity. During the following years he may have been a member of the Local Territorial Army, which in Buckley meant the Royal Artillery.    Clearly Fred wished to seek new adventure and was no doubt stimulated by the advertisements appearing during the years immediately before the First World War for young people to emigrate to the British colonies in Canada, South Africa and Australia. His brother remembered Fred being an avid reader of adventure books and travel pamphlets. Freds mother had a brother who had moved to Australia ( R.C. Williams of Woomera, South Australia) and it is believed that he sent Australian magazines to the family.    Together with two friends, William (Bill) Gray and Emrys Jones, he left Buckley for Australia in 1913. They sailed from London to Melbourne on the 29th. August on the Otway. We have no information as to what happened to Bill and Emrys after they left Buckley.     Fred is known to have worked in Tasmania, in South Australia and in Victoria. For at least part of the time he worked as a waiter. In South Australia he lived in the Largs Bay area and struck up a friendship with Suzy Gelvin who was sixteen on 31st March 1914, Fred was then nineteen. From letters she later wrote to the Australian army seeking information about Fred, they had continued to correspond after Fred joined the army. Suzy did not marry until April 1928 and this marriage ended after the birth of her second child. Kay, her daughter, remembers her mother talking of a young man very special to her, who was killed in WW1, she always got tears in her eyes when she spoke of this. Suzy took the girls to the annual ANZAC Day remembrance services every year and her daughter recalls her having had tears in her eyes. Kay never knew the name of the young soldier but remembers her mother talking fondly of special times, of walking along the beach with him accompanied by her dog, Jack. It is a real regret that we did not establish any contact with the Gelvin family until after Suzys death. Her recollections of and strong connections with Fred would have been powerful.    Following the outbreak of the First World War, Fred enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 18th August 1914 in Melbourne. Fred gave his age on arrival in Australia as 22 when, in fact, he had been just 19. His occupation was recorded as a labourer and his Australian address as Care of Mrs. Cornelius, 18 King Street, Norwood, Adelaide, South Australia.     Mrs. Cornelius was another person who wrote to the Australian army in 1917 seeking information about Fred and we can assume that she was his landlady in South Australia and that he had continued to correspond with her as well, as she had his latest army address in 1917.    After basic training at the Broadmeadows camp outside Melbourne, Fred was posted to the 2nd Field Ambulance, part of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Australian Division which left Australia on 19th October 1914, destination France. Fred sailed on the troopship Wiltshire and this vessel, together with others carrying his Division, were diverted to Alexandria in Egypt, arriving on 10th December 1914. Here the unit established a training base just outside Cairo, within sight of the Great Pyramid. The 2nd Field Ambulance eventually sailed for Lemnos on 7th April 1915 to prepare for the ANZAC landings on the Gallipoli peninsula.    His unit landed on 25th April 1915 at Anzac Beach, Gallipoli. The Major General commanding 1st Division recommended Freds actions on that day for an award for carrying wounded single handed under shell and rifle fire from the firing line from positions where it was impossible to take stretchers     The 2nd Brigade were drafted to assist at Kvithia, Cape Helles in May 1915 and on the 8th May he gained a second recommendation for an award for Devotion to duty under heavy rifle and shell fire. Around this time Fred acquired a non standard issue Belgian five shoot revolver which was with his effects at the time of his death. The revolver is now at the National Memorial, Canberra.    He was wounded on 26th June whilst working as a stretcher bearer.    Freds Division was shipped back to Egypt when the AIF left Gallipoli in December 1915 and then moved on to Marseilles arriving on 30th March 1916 for the train journey to the Western Front and the preparations for the Somme offensive. In May of that year Fred was promoted to Lance Corporal and only three months later promoted again to Corporal after the incident that brought him the Military Medal. The official record states that - At Poziere on 26th July LCpl Birks continually led his squad of stretcher bearers through Pozieres Wood and village from the front line, many of the Regimental stretcher bearers being out of action. He was exposed to shell fire the whole time.    When his units were moved away from the Front, Fred was able to spend a short period of leave back with his family in Buckley. His arrival in Buckley was remembered by many pupils of his former school, St. Matthews, as the Turkish flag he had taken in Gallipoli was displayed in the school. Fred returned to his unit in France and his army records indicate that he suffered an illness that caused him to stay in hospital for five days in February 1917. A week after leaving hospital he was on his way to Officer training school having been selected for a commission.      The Australian system for selecting junior officers was based on performance and merit. Clearly Freds actions, albeit in an ambulance unit, had marked him out as a strong candidate for a commission. He attended the Australian 1st Division school in France and received his commission in April 1917 as a Second Lieutenant with the 6th AIF Battalion (he had asked for this unit since he had acted as stretcher bearer with them since leaving Australia in 1914). He joined his regiment as they were preparing for the next big offensive in the area east of Ypres.    His first major action as an officer was to be his last. On 20th September 1917, the opening day of the Battle of the Menin Road which began the 3rd Battle of Passchendale. This was the first of four battles in September and October in which the A.I.F. was engaged. The battles were a part of a general offensive to push the Germans off the Passchendale - Messines Ridge and achieve a breakthrough. For the A.I.F. it was a fight to control Menin Road ridge, the high ground which the road crossed on the way east. The 1st and 2nd Divisions, with a combined front of 1800 metres, were at the centre of a 13 kilometre British front. The Australians were positioned along Westhoek Ridge and faced enemy - held Glencorse Wood.     The Battalion history records the events leading up to the attack.     The Battalion moved from Zillebeke Bund on the night of 18th/19th to trenches and positions near trenches. D Coy relieved B Coy of 1st Battalion in front line, C Coy to Mennin Tunnel, A Coy to Leinster Farm and B Coy to Half Way House. En route there were some casualties resulting from barrage near Zillebeke (mostly gas shells) and near Clapham Junction through which the Battalion had to pass. The day of 19th passed without incident or casualties, all preparations being complete.    When the battle began at dawn on 20th September, the troops closely followed their own barrage, overcame enemy infantry opposition and an unusually rapid advance took them to the north edge of Glencorse Wood, Hannebeek Swamp and the bogs of Nonne Boschen Wood.    In Glencorse Wood part of the 6th Battalion was held up by a machine - gun in a pillbox. Second Lieutenant Fred Birks, with Corporal W. Johnston, rushed the post. Johnston was wounded but Fred Birks killed the enemy and captured the gun. At once he organised a small party and attacked another strong point occupied by about twenty-five Germans. Some of the enemy were killed and an officer and fifteen men were captured. Pressing on, Birks reorganised a large number of Australians who had strayed from the units during the attack and consolidated the sector he had captured. By noon that day (20th September) the 1st and 2nd Divisions had taken all their objectives and were at the western end of Polygon Wood.    The message map found in Fred Birks possession after his death gives more information about the action. It is dated 20th September and timed at 7 a.m. and clearly shows where he believed his position was at that time.    The reverse of the message map indicates Freds understanding of his and his mens position. Other companies were retreating in disorder and he believed that he was being shelled by his own artillery, not an uncommon incident in the confused situation of trench warfare of the First World War. It was in this confused situation that he confidently reorganised men and attacked the enemy strong points with such devastating effect.     The Battalion record continues;   During the morning the enemy shelling was light and work proceeded rapidly & well, by 1000 posts had been dug and a fair system of defence had been established. At 1230 a message was received from 7th Bn that the enemy were counter attacking their front line. C Coy was ordered to stand by in readiness to support and at 1400 moved forward to support 7th Bn.    During the morning and afternoon carrying parties worked very hard, they moved a considerable amount of ammunition & stores from CLAPHAM JUNCTION to forward battalions. This was also proceeded with during the night and next day. At 2000 double sentry posts were mounted in all posts and throughout the night Patrols kept touch with right & left Brigades & the Battalion in front. At 1927 S.O.S. signal was observed on our direct front and our artillery put up a barrage in front of our lines. At this time enemy shelling was heavy but slackened again at 2030 and remained quiet until 0430 next morning.    Before dawn our aeroplanes flew low over enemy's lines and fired into their trenches with Machine Guns. They remained up until after daylight. From 0430 (Stand to) until 0539 our artillery put a stationary barrage in front of our forward lines in case the enemy were preparing for a counter attack. The enemy replied vigorously to our artillery & shelled all our sector heavily. One shell bursting in a post of D Coy Killed Lieutenant BIRKS and 4 Other Ranks and wounded 2 others.    Fred Birks was just twenty three years old. He was killed at his post by a shell whilst endeavouring to extricate some of his men who had been buried by a previous shell. For his actions on the 20th and 21st September 1917 Fred Birks was nominated for the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry, by Maj. Gen. W. R. Birdwood Commanding the 1st Australian Division whose recommendation is dated 27th September 1917. Freds VC was the only one awarded to the 6th Australian Infantry Battalion. His V.C was the last one to be awarded at the Battle of Passchendale. The copy of the recommendation in the Australian Army records reads.    During the advance on GLENCORSE WOOD East of YPRES on 20th Sept, 1917 this officer accompanied only by a Cpl. rushed a strong point which was holding up the advance. The Cpl. was wounded by a bomb but 2/Lt BIRKS went on himself, killed the remaining Germans and captured a machine gun. Shortly afterwards he organised a small party and attacked another strong point which was occupied by about 25 Germans; after killing a number of these they captured an Officer and 15 men. During the consolidation this Officer did magnificent work in reorganising parties of other units who had been disorganised owing to getting too close to our own barrage. By his wonderful coolness and personal bravery he kept his men in splendid spirits through-out. 2/Lt BIRKS was killed at his post by a shell on the morning of 21st Sept. whilst standing exposed endeavouring to extricate some of his men who had been buried by a shell.    The official citation was published in the London Gazette on 8th November 1917    Second Lieutenant Frederick Birks, VC, MM  6th Australian Infantry Battalion, AIF    20th September 1917, at Glencorse Wood, East of Ypres, Belgium.    Citation: For most conspicuous bravery in attack when, accompanied by only a corporal, he rushed a strong-point which was holding up the advance. The corporal was wounded by a bomb but Second Lieutenant Birks went on by himself, killed the remainder of the enemy occupying the position, and captured a machine gun. Shortly afterwards he organised a small party and attacked another strong-point which was occupied by about twenty-five of the enemy; of whom many were killed and an officer and fifteen men captured. During the consolidation this officer did magnificent work in reorganising parties of other units who had been disorganised during the operation. By his wonderful coolness and personal bravery, Second Lieutenant Birks kept his men in splendid spirits throughout. He was killed at his post by a shell whilst standing exposed endeavouring to extricate some of his men who had been buried by a shell."
312,"Richards is the top points scorer in this season's Super League Pat Richards broke Wigan's record for most points in a Super League match as the early league leaders thrashed winless Catalans. Richards scored five tries, four in the first half, and kicked nine goals to rack up 38 points - six more than Andy Farrell against Huddersfield in 2000. Sean O'Loughlin and Darrell Goulding also crossed in the opening 40 minutes as Warriors led 36-0 at the break. Thomas Leuluai and two George Carmont tries completed the rout. With Wakefield losing at St Helens, Wigan are now the only team with a 100% record in this season's Super League. And there was no question that the star of the show in making it four wins out of four for the Warriors was winger Richards as he took his points tally for the season to 70. His 38 points also took him into second place in the Super League record books for most points in a match, behind Iestyn Harris, who scored 42 for Leeds against Huddersfield in July 1999. Surely there can't be an overseas signing better than Richards in SL history    Richards scored every one of Wigan's opening 18 points, starting his tally from Carmont's clever offload. A good move involving Mark Riddell, Sam Tomkins and Amos Roberts sent him over for his second, before Carmont claimed the assist for Richards' hat-trick try. O'Loughlin touched down Tomkins' grubber kick and then turned provider for Goulding to touch down in the corner. Richards resumed centre stage just before the break when he grounded Tomkins' beautifully flighted kick, and the onslaught continued after a slow start to the second half by the home side, not helped by an injury to O'Loughlin. Carmont went over after a neat offload from Phil Bailey and then grabbed his second after intercepting on halfway. But it was only fitting that Richards completed the scoring when he outpaced the Dragons defence, even if he went on to miss his only conversion attempt of the night. Wigan coach Michael Maguire on Pat Richards:   ""He was great tonight and I felt for him when he hit the post with that last kick. ""He would have ended up with 10 out of 10 but Paddy had a great game tonight. ""That's credit to him. He's working very hard and the performances are coming out."" Catalans coach Kevin Walters:   ""I just feel embarrassed for the club. ""We just have to look forward to next week now because there's not a lot we can get out of tonight, except a lot of embarrassment. ""My attitude doesn't change if we win or we lose. We'll work hard again next week and see how we go. ""Obviously we'll try and do a bit better than we did this week.""     "
313,"London's Olympic Stadium will host five games at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, which is being held across 13 venues.  Twickenham will host the opening match of the 20-team event on 18 September, with hosts England taking on the winner of the Oceania qualifying competition.  Eight football stadiums, including Wembley and Villa Park will be used.  Rugby Football Union (RFU) chief executive Ian Ritchie said: ""It is truly a national event that the game and the country will feel a part of.""  Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, Kingsholm in Gloucester and Exeter's Sandy Park are the only other rugby venues.  The World Cup has been seen as a unique chance to 'spread the gospel' of rugby in England, and reach new audiences away from the sport's heartlands. It may come a surprise then that just six of the 48 matches will be played in the north, and almost half in the south-east including 17 in London. This, and the fact that only two club rugby grounds are being used, is evidence of the pressure organisers are under to sell more than two million tickets, and make the £80m which the International Rugby Board has been promised. The withdrawal of Old Trafford as a venue hasn't helped of course, hence the importance of the Olympic stadium as a host for five matches.  International Rugby Board (IRB) chairman Bernard Lapasset said: ""The Rugby World Cup is very special. It's not a football stadium or a rugby stadium, it's a stadium for the Rugby World Cup.""  The Olympic Stadium will host pool games involving South Africa, New Zealand and France, as well as hosting the match between Ireland and Italy on Sunday, 4 October.  The bronze match, on Friday, 30 October, will also be played at the east London stadium.  The 82,000-capacity Twickenham will host 10 games, including three of England's four pool games, two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final on Saturday, 31 October.  England will play their final pool game, against a qualifier, at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium.  The Millennium Stadium will host two of Wales' pool games and two quarter-finals among its eight games.  Wales open their campaign in Cardiff on Sunday, 20 September against a qualifier, before taking on England at Twickenham the following Saturday.  Scotland play their opening game at Kingsholm on Wednesday, 23 September before their next game four days later at Leeds United's Elland Road.  The 13 venues were selected from a long list that was announced in October 2012.  Sandy Park and the Etihad Stadium were added to the list after Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium was withdrawn.  Five other football stadiums were also omitted - Sunderland's Stadium of Light, St Mary's in Southampton, Bristol City's Ashton Gate, Derby's Pride Park and the Ricoh Arena in Coventry.  The tournament's organisers, England Rugby 2015, must sell 2.9 million tickets to cover the £80m guarantee owed to the International Rugby Board.  England Rugby 2015's chief executive Debbie Jevans said: ""It is a great mix and will ensure that 92% of the population is within 50 miles of a World Cup venue.  ""We're confident we're going to be able to honour the minimum access prices that there were and that's certainly a commitment to us to be able to do that.  ""We really wanted to take England to the north west and we are delighted Manchester City came to the table.  ""We want 2015 to remembered as a rugby year, the Rugby World Cup, and to create a generation of rugby heroes and role models.""  Twelve teams have qualified for the finals - Australia, England and Wales in Pool A, South Africa, Samoa and Scotland in Pool B, New Zealand, Argentina and Tonga in Pool C and France, Ireland and Italy in Pool D.  Each pool will be made up of five teams, meaning there are eight places to be filled via a series of qualifying matches which will be concluded in 2014."
314,"Since the downfall of Saddam Hussein, insurgent groups have targeted coalition forces and anyone working alongside the US in the rebuilding of Iraq.  Insurgents have increasingly also turned on Shia targets - both those linked to the Shia-dominated Iraqi government and civilian targets such as Shia shrines and festivals.  Tracking the insurgency's size and make-up is notoriously difficult, with groups constantly appearing and disappearing, and allegiances shifting.  The insurgency is mainly Sunni, but draws its membership from diverse backgrounds.  Fighters range from former figures in Saddam Hussein's Baath party to Sunni nationalists fearing Shia domination and foreign Islamist fighters who see Iraq as an arena for a global struggle against the West.  The incentives driving individual insurgents are equally disparate - from religious zeal to economic gain, nationalist feeling and anger at the loss of loved ones to the conflict.  Virtually all insurgent groups share the goal of attacking US forces, but other goals vary - with some elements apparently aiming to foment civil war.  Estimates of the number of insurgents are impossible to confirm.  By 2006, US military estimates ranged from 8,000 to 20,000, although Iraqi intelligence officials have issued figures as high as 40,000 fighters plus another 160,000 supporters.  Fighters have been found among the insurgents from countries including Syria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Sudan.  Foreign nationals are widely considered to account for less than 10% of the insurgency, but their role is high profile.  Some Sunnis have also formed informal militias, which operate as private defence forces in certain neighbourhoods where Shia militias are thought likely - or known - to carry out attacks.  Al-Qaeda of Jihad Organisation in the Land of the Two Rivers is the country's most prominent insurgent group, blamed for many of the bloodiest bombings and beheadings.  It was led by the Jordanian militant, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, until he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006.  He emerged in Iraq as the alleged head of the Tawhid and Jihad group, which was blamed for some of the biggest early insurgent attacks.  These included the truck bombing that killed 23 at the UN headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003 and the blast in Najaf 10 days later that killed a senior Shia cleric and more than 85 others.  Tawhid and Jihad was also known for the brutal beheadings of foreign hostages, which were posted on the internet in video footage attributed to the group.  An internet statement in 2004 claimed that the group had joined Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, although the depth of the links is not clear.  Al-Qaeda in Iraq's hallmarks include synchronised bomb attacks, as well as the abduction and murder of foreign hostages.  The bombs have had a range of targets - from US military personnel to Iraq's fledgling security forces and its Shia community. Shia Muslims have been derided as apostates in messages attributed to Zarqawi.  Igniting sectarian conflict is central to al-Qaeda's strategy in Iraq, according to a letter purportedly authored by Zarqawi and released by the US military in early 2004.  Foreign ""jihadi"" fighters are widely thought to play a key role in the group, although some analysts say it may have also have a considerable Iraqi membership.  Shortly after Zarqawi's death, al-Qaeda in Iraq named a new leader, Abu-Hamzah al-Muhajir, thought to be a pseudonym.  Uncertainly surrounds the new leader, although the US military released a picture of a man it named as Abu Ayyub al-Masri and said was an Egyptian militant based in Baghdad.  In early 2006, al-Qaeda in Iraq posted an internet statement saying it had joined five other insurgent groups in Iraq to form a new umbrella organisation, the Mujahideen Shura Council.  Two of these groups were known - the Victorious Sect Army and the Islamic Jihad Brigade, while three were apparently new groups.  The Mujahideen Shura Council issues statements and posts videos on a website - including a video showing the executions of two Russian hostages in June 2006.  Analysts say moves to build co-operation and a unified strategy among the disparate insurgent groups have had some success.  A section of the insurgency comprising former elements of Saddam Hussein's regime, Baath party supporters, former Iraqi soldiers and secular Sunnis is often referred to as ""Sunni nationalists"".  Analysts believe that in the wake of the US-led invasion, some former regime figures provided the nascent insurgency with access to regime funds and weapons caches.  In September 2005, an Iraqi court convicted a nephew of the deposed leader of funding insurgents.  Commentators have also blamed much of the violence on the decision by former US governor Paul Bremer to disband the Iraqi army in 2003, without disarming it.  US forces have faced their greatest challenges in areas of central Iraq - such as the city of Falluja - that had a strong tradition of military service.  Since late 2005, the US has said it is trying to drive a wedge between the more extreme Islamist groups and the more secular and moderate nationalists.  Sunni insurgent groups were split over participation in elections in December 2005, although support from some boosted significant Sunni turnout and thus Sunni influence on the new government.  But a report by Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said even Sunni leaders who were participating in - rather than attacking - the political process, were forming their own forces to counter the existing Shia militias.  Ansar al-Islam is a radical Sunni Muslim group with its base in mountainous northern Iraq.  It draws its recruits from Kurds who oppose the US-backed Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party, according to US intelligence website globalsecurity.org.  The group, which is also known as Ansar al-Sunna, suffered a severe setback during in early 2003, losing many bases to the US bombing campaign.  In February 2004, it claimed responsibility for simultaneous suicide bomb attacks on the offices of the two US-backed mainstream Kurdish political parties.  The group's alleged leader, Mullah Krekar, has lived in Norway as a refugee since 1991.  The US has said Ansar al-Islam has ties to al-Qaeda - it has also accused Iran of giving support to the group.  Some Iraqi political parties have armed wings, despite US pressure to disband militias.  A growing trend of sectarian killings in Baghdad and other mixed Sunni and Shia areas of the country has prompted fears of civil war.  Groups of corpses, typically with hands bound and gunshot wounds to the head, sometimes bearing signs of torture, have regularly been found.  In some cases gunmen, sometimes dressed in the uniforms of government security forces, abduct victims or pull them from cars at checkpoints.  There are widespread suspicions that militias linked to two key Shia parties are involved in targeting Sunnis.  While the allegations have not been proven, these militias are becoming increasingly prominent as sectarian divisions grow.  The US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, has described such groups as ""the infrastructure of civil war"".  Separately from the main militias, some Shia have also formed informal defence forces which provide security for local neighbourhoods, with armed guards carrying out patrols and manning roadblocks.  The Mehdi Army is led by Moqtada Sadr, a young, radical Shia cleric.  His brand of Shia nationalism, opposition to the US presence in Iraq and hostility toward the powerful established Shia political parties has proved popular among poor, disenfranchised Shia.  Mr Sadr's key stronghold is the slum district of Sadr City, named after his father, a revered cleric murdered by Saddam Hussein's security forces.  The US has accused Iran of providing funding and support to the Mehdi Army.  Mehdi fighters staged uprisings against US-led forces in April and August 2004, but Mr Sadr has since become involved in the political process and holds 30 seats in the Shia bloc that dominates parliament.  As insurgent attacks have increasingly targeted Shia areas, the Mehdi Army has become one of the major armed forces on the ground in Baghdad, controlling - and protecting - predominantly Shia areas.  Sunnis have accused its members of carrying out sectarian killings, although Mr Sadr denies the accusations.  The Badr Brigade - sometimes called the Badr Organisation - is the armed wing of the largest Shia party in Iraq, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution (Sciri) in Iraq.  Sciri opposed Saddam Hussein from Iran for many years.  The Badr Brigade waged a low-level war of ambushes, sabotage, and assassinations against the regime, using undercover cells in Iraq and bases in Iran.  Sciri's leader, Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, took over from his brother, Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, after he was assassinated in a bombing in 2003 - which some blame on Zarqawi's Tawhid and Jihad group.  Sciri is one of the largest parties in the Shia coalition which dominates the Iraqi parliament, and still has strong Iranian connections.  In 2005, under Sciri minister Bayan Jaber the Interior Ministry was accused of recruiting large numbers of the militia's members into the security forces and turning a blind eye to death squads targeting Sunnis.  Mr Jaber, a former Badr Brigade commander, denied any Interior Ministry involvement in sectarian killings.  In January 2006, four policemen arrested by US forces after saying they were going to execute a Sunni man were found to be linked to the Badr Brigade.  But there has been little other evidence to substantiate the widely-made accusations against the organisation.  Both the Badr Brigade and Mehdi army have strong presences in the southern city of Basra."
315,"The former war children claim they suffered widespread abuse and discrimination after the war.  During the war the Nazis encouraged liaisons between German troops and Norwegian women.  It was part of a plan to breed an Aryan master race of blonde-haired, blue-eyed babies for the Thousand-Year Reich.  As for the infants produced by these affairs, most became known as Lebensborn Children. In post-war Norway they became targets of abuse, often bullied, beaten, even locked away in mental institutions just because their fathers had been German soldiers.  Now, 150 war children are seeking justice at the European Court of Human Rights.  They are suing the Norwegian state for having failed to protect them after the war and for discriminating against them.  Norway has, in the past, offered limited compensation to former Lebensborn Children but the authorities have never accepted responsibility for alleged cases of harassment dating back up to 60 years.  The Court will hear the case on Thursday and decide about its admissibility. Later, if it is found admissible, the European Court will then judge the actual complaint on its merits."
316,"Contrary to popular belief, the Cuban missile crisis did not end with the agreement between the US and Soviet Union in October, 1962. Unknown to the US at the time, there were 100 other nuclear weapons also in the hands of Cuba, sparking a frantic - and ingenious - Russian mission to recover them.  In November 2011, aware that the 50th anniversary of the most dangerous few weeks in history was less than a year away, my Russian colleague Pasha Shilov and I came across several new accounts that changed our perspective on the Cuban missile crisis and how much we thought we knew about it.  Growing up in Berkshire, England, through the nuclear paranoia of the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan's Cruise and Pershing missiles stationed only 30 miles away from my family home, I was inculcated with a keen awareness of Cold War brinkmanship.  Pasha grew up in Moscow and described how it was from the Soviet point of view - equally frightening by his account.  But what we've now learned about the chilling events of October and November 1962 has put our own experiences into perspective - and maybe given rise to a few more grey hairs along the way.  Our investigations took us to St Petersburg and the Soviet Submariners Veterans' Society via the National Security Archive in Washington DC, where Svetlana Savranskaya, the director of the Russian archives, told us an incredible story.  There had been a second secret missile crisis that continued the danger of a catastrophic nuclear war until the end of November 1962.  This extended the known missile crisis well beyond the weekend of 27-28 October, the time that had always been thought of as the moment the danger finally lifted with the deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev to withdraw the Soviet missiles in exchange for a US promise not to invade Cuba.  The secret missile crisis came about through an unnerving mix of Soviet duplicity, American intelligence failures and the mercurial temperament of Fidel Castro.  The Cuban leader, cut out of the main negotiations between the superpowers over the fate of the long range Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba, began to cease cooperation with Moscow.  Fearing that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions Khrushchev had made to Kennedy, might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the superpowers, the Soviet leader concocted a plan to give Castro a consolation prize.  The prize was an offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles, but which crucially had passed completely under the radar of US intelligence.  Khrushchev concluded that because the Americans hadn't listed the missiles on their list of demands, the Soviet Union's interests would be well served by keeping them in Cuba.  Kremlin number two, Anastas Mikoyan, was charged with making the trip to Havana, principally to calm Castro down and make him what seemed like an offer he couldn't refuse.  Mikoyan, whose wife was seriously ill, took the assignment knowing that the future of relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union were on the line. Shortly after arriving in Cuba, Mikoyan received word that his wife had died, but despite this, he pledged to stay in Cuba and complete negotiations with Castro.  In the weeks that followed, Mikoyan kept the detail of the missile transfer to himself while he witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of the Cuban leader convinced that Moscow had sold Cuba's defence down the river.  Castro particularly objected to the constant flights over Cuba by American surveillance aircraft and, as Mikoyan learned to his horror, ordered Cuban anti-aircraft gunners to fire on them.  Knowing how delicate the state of relations were between the US and Russia after the worst crisis since World War II, US forces around the world remained on Defcon 2, one short of global nuclear war until 20 November.  Mikoyan came to a personal decision that under no circumstances should Castro and his military be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs.  He then extricated Moscow from a seemingly intractable situation which risked blowing the entire crisis back up in the faces of Kennedy and Khrushchev.  On 22 November 1962, during a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan was forced to use the dark arts of diplomacy to convince Castro that despite Moscow's best intentions, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law (which didn't actually exist) to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent.  Finally after Mikoyan's trump card, Castro was forced to give way and - much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government - the tactical nuclear weapons were finally crated and returned by sea back to the Soviet Union during December 1962.  This story has illuminated a chapter in history that has been partially closed for the past 50 years.  But it leaves us with a great respect for Mikoyan and his ability to judge and eventually contain an extremely dangerous situation which could have affected many millions of people.  Joe Matthews is a producer for Wild Iris TV, which has made a short film about the ""secret"" Cuban missile crisis"
317,"Kate Middleton's family has had a coat of arms designed, which will feature on a souvenir royal wedding programme.  Her father Michael commissioned the heraldic design to mark his daughter's marriage to Prince William on 29 April.  It features three acorn sprigs, one for each of the Middletons' children: an idea Miss Middleton suggested.  Royal experts say the coat of arms - which cost £4,400 to make - marks the increased social status of her parents and her potential as a future queen.  Thomas Woodcock, Garter Principal King of Arms, from the College of Arms in the City of London, helped the Middletons with the design.  He said the oak tree was a traditional symbol of England and a feature of west Berkshire, where the family have lived for 30 years.  Mr Woodcock said the gold chevron in the centre of the coat of arms signified Miss Middleton's mother, Carole, whose maiden name was Goldsmith.  Kate's coat of arms includes a tied ribbon, showing she is an unmarried woman, and features three acorn sprigs, representing each of the Middleton children. At its centre is a gold inverted ""V"" reflecting Kate's mother Carole's maiden name of Goldsmith and white chevronels, symbolising mountains, representing the family's love of the Lake District and skiing William's coat of arms has a design derived from that of his father, the Prince of Wales, and has a main shield featuring the three lions, lion rampant and harp stringed argent of England, Scotland and Ireland. It also has the lion and unicorn supporters - symbols of the UK. The white label features a sea shell or ""escallop"", taken from the family coat of arms of his mother, Princess Diana. The blue garter symbolises his appointment at Knight of the Garter  White chevronels - narrow chevrons above and below the gold chevron - symbolise peaks and mountains, and the Middleton family's love of the Lake District and skiing.  Mr Woodcock said: ""It's not compulsory, but as their daughter is marrying into the Royal Family she will have a need probably to use a coat of arms.""  He said Miss Middleton could have been granted her own heraldic design but her father wanted the whole family to be able to use it.  A version of the coat of arms, which can only be used by Kate or her sister Pippa as it denotes a Middleton spinster, will be printed on the back of the souvenir programme. Prince William's will be on the front.  Miss Middleton's heraldic design features a tied ribbon to show she is an unmarried woman.  Overall, it is designed like an elaborate lozenge rather than a shield, a shape reserved for men.  She will be able to use the coat of arms up until her wedding day, after which it will be combined with that of Prince William.  Mr Woodcock said: ""With any new design of a coat of arms you have to make sure that the design is distinct not just in colour but in the linear appearance.  ""And, as there is a 16th Century coat of arms with a chevron between three sprigs of oak, we've made the differences - dividing the background colours.""  Broadcast footage of the wedding will be streamed live on the royal YouTube channel, accompanied by a live blog put together by staff at Clarence House and St James's Palace.  The commentary will provide historical information and links to previously unpublished photographs and video footage with live updates on social media sites such as facebook and twitter.  This will be the first royal wedding with its own twitter hashtag: #rw2011.  Members of the public have been invited to send their good wishes in the form of a video message to be shown in an online digital wedding book.  150,000 copies of the official souvenir programme booklet will go on sale on the day of the wedding.  The booklet will be handed out along the processional route by a team of military cadets and Explorer Scouts.  The cost will be £2, with proceeds to go to the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry.  But it will also be available to download for free the day before the wedding from the official Royal Wedding website."
318,"The Doctor and Jo visit the Master in his high-security prison on an island off the south coast of England and hear from the governor, Colonel Trenchard, that ships have been mysteriously disappearing at sea.  Investigating, the Doctor learns from Captain Hart, commander of a nearby Naval base, that the sinkings have centred around an abandoned sea fort. He and Jo then visit the fort and are attacked by what one of the men there terms a Sea Devil - an amphibious breed of the prehistoric creatures encountered by the Doctor shortly after his exile to Earth.  The Master, aided by a misguided Trenchard, is stealing equipment from the Naval base in order to build a machine to revive the Sea Devils from hibernation.  The Doctor takes a diving bell down to the Sea Devils' underwater base to try to encourage peace. His efforts are frustrated by a depth charge attack ordered by a pompous politician, Walker, but in the confusion he manages to free a captured submarine and escape back to the surface.  The Sea Devils then capture the Naval base, and the Master has the Doctor taken back to their control centre, where he forces him to help finish the machine. The Doctor sabotages the machine and the two Time Lords escape together just as the base is destroyed in an explosion.  The Doctor and Jo head for the sea fort to investigate further. Once there, their boat is destroyed, trapping them inside. They hear the shuffling gait and rasping breath of something approaching them down a corridor.  The Doctor returns to the prison to see the Master and walks into his trap. The two Time Lords fight with swords. The Doctor seems to gain the upper hand but, when he turns his back, the Master pulls a knife and throws it straight at him.  With Jo's help, the Doctor escapes from the Master's prison. The two head for the beach, where they find themselves caught between a squad of castle guards, a minefield and a Sea Devil that the Master has summoned from the sea.  The Doctor determines to descend in a diving bell to try to make contact with the reptiles. Jo watches anxiously as the bell is lowered. After a short time contact is lost and it is hauled back up again. Jo looks inside and sees to her horror that the Doctor has gone.  The Master leads an attack by the Sea Devils on the naval base. The Doctor and Jo, on their way with Captain Hart to try to make contact with the reptiles once more, find themselves facing the creatures on the base.  With the Sea Devil base destroyed, the Master contrives to escape in a hovercraft.  The Doctor : [Speaking of the Master.] ""He used to be a friend of mine once... a very good friend. In fact, you might almost say we were at school together.""  The Doctor : ""If Horatio Nelson had been in charge of this operation, I hardly think that he would have waited for official instructions.""  Captain Hart : ""Yes... a pretty impulsive fellow. If one can believe the history books.""  The Doctor : ""History books? Captain Hart, Horatio Nelson was a personal friend of mine.""  The Doctor : ""Why begin a long and bloody war where thousands will be killed on both sides?""  Chief Sea Devil : ""We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet.""  The Doctor : ""Is there nothing I can say to make you reconsider?""  Trenchard : [To Hart] ""Time for a quick one?""  Trenchard : [To the Master] ""I can't keep it up, you know""  The Doctor and the Master were very good friends once: 'In fact, you might almost say we were at school together' [the Academy].  The 'Sea Devils' are never named (the fort survivor rambles on about sea devils). They are marine relatives of the Silurians, which this story makes clear is a misnomer. The Doctor blames their discoverer for this mistake, and calls them Eocenes. Unlike the land-based species, these creatures do not have a biological heat weapon, but instead have hand-held devices. There are colonies of perhaps millions of the creatures throughout the world.  The Master discovered the existence of the Sea Devils in stolen Time Lord files (see Terror of the Autons, 'Colony in Space'). [The Doctor, on the other hand, is unaware of the existence of the 'Silurians'.]  The sonic screwdriver can detect and explode mines. The Doctor is a trained diver and a very accurate blindfold golfer. Jo knows how to operate a hovercraft.  A south coast naval base (HMS Foxglove) and prison and surrounding waters, [Autumn 1971 (Note the Master's reference to colour television. The Clangers episode was first shown six months earlier.)]  The Doctor is a friend of Nelson's.  Stuntman Stuart Fell doubles, rather unconvincingly, for Katy Manning in the scene in Episode One where Jo climbs up a ladder to the sea fort.  The Doctor claims that the earlier description of the Earth's one-time reptilian rulers as 'Silurians' was incorrect, and that they should really have been referred to as 'Eocenes'. This piece of dialogue was included by writer Malcolm Hulke in response to claims by one or more viewers that it was impossible in evolutionary terms for the Silurian era to have spawned man-sized reptiles; ironically, however, it is equally unlikely that the Eocene era could have been the origin of such creatures.  This is the last instance of Derek Ware's stunt organisation HAVOC being contracted to perform a story's stunt work.  The Master watches The Rock Collector episode of Clangers on a television in his prison cell and fails to realise that it is a children's puppet show until this is pointed out to him by Colonel Trenchard. (The Master fully realises the nature of what he is watching. His comment to Trenchard that the Clangers seem to be 'a rather interesting extraterrestrial life-form' is intended to be a joke, and his expression clearly shows his frustration at Trenchard's lack of a sense of humour when he takes it literally.)  Roger Delgado was afraid of the water and it took great courage for him to film the scene in which the Master and the Doctor are rescued from the sea by the Navy. (This was frequently recalled by Jon Pertwee in later interviews, but according to Delgado's widow Kismet it is untrue. Delgado was actually worried about getting his costume wet, as there was no spare available.)  The Doctor reverses the polarity of the neutron flow (the only occasion he does during the Pertwee era).  The helicopter sent to rescue the Doctor and Jo changes in mid flight (it begins as a grey Sea King marked SO; in the second shot it has an orange nose and tail stripe and is numbered 56).  Jo leaves her handbag in the prison when rescuing the Doctor, but later regains it.  The rope attached to the life belt point is slack when the Master arrives, despite the fact that the Doctor is descending the cliff on it.  A rack of swords is placed just outside the Master's cell.  The Doctor's diving bell is pulled up so rapidly that he probably would have got the bends if he had been in it.  How did the air sea rescue helicopter get to the sea fort before the Doctor asks for it?  Why is the submarine hi-jacked?  Why don't the Sea Devils attack the escaping submarine?  In episode six, the Doctor's tinkering with the gadget disables the Sea Devils, and the Master just stands there and watches.  Jo (and stuntman Terry Walsh) in a white flared trouser suit, which goes well with the red crash helmet when following the Doctor on a motorbike.  Title Music - Ron Grainer and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, arranged by Delia Derbyshire  A good Malcolm Hulke script, full of characters (there are well over 20 speaking parts). The pace is pedestrian, although this gives a little more room for suspense. Like Doctor Who and the Silurians, the music veers between being eerily experimental and tunelessly intrusive.  We open on a ship. Screams and shouts can be heard over the clamour of alarms, and a panicked sailor calls for help into the radio. Suddenly an alien hand reaches out and grasps the microphone as the sailor screams in terror...  From this dramatic beginning The Sea Devils unfolds as a colourful adventure yarn in much the same vein as The Claws of Axos and The Daemons. 'The Sea Devils was intended to be fun, and that's exactly what it succeeds in being,' wrote Alistair Hughes in TSV 48, dated August 1996. 'From the Doctor's famous ""Horatio Nelson"" quote in Episode One to the Master's cavalier wave as he makes his escape in Episode Six, we are treated to an enjoyable ride filled with memorable moments and fine portrayals.'  Despite the story's near-contemporary Earth setting, UNIT is for once totally unseen, leaving the Royal Navy to deal with this latest threat to the planet's security. The implication may perhaps be that UNIT is a purely land-based force with no jurisdiction over incidents occurring at sea, but this is left as a matter for speculation as no explanation is provided in the story itself. Fulfilling the Brigadier's usual narrative function as an incredulous military figurehead is Captain Hart, ably played by Edwin Richfield, who also has a trusty number two in the person of 3rd Officer Jane Blythe.  The most interesting guest character of all, however, is Colonel Trenchard, brilliantly portrayed by Clive Morton - although it must be seen as a damning indictment of the British authorities that they are content to entrust the security of the Master, supposedly their number one prisoner, to this bumbling ex-colonial official. It would indeed be difficult to imagine any less suitable person than Trenchard to be placed in charge of the Master, who manages to win him over without even using his hypnotic abilities, purely by the power of persuasion!  The monsters on this occasion are the eponymous Sea Devils (although the only character to refer to them as such is Clark, one of the hapless caretakers of the sea fort, who babbles incoherently about 'sea devils' when he is found by the Doctor and Jo). 'The finned, turtle-like Sea Devil heads are especially striking and stand lingering close-ups on many memorable occasions,' wrote Hughes. 'The head masks were worn as ""top hats"" by the actors to increase the neck length and break up the human shape, and the [result] brings to mind large aquatic creatures like whales and dolphins, which have very large heads with long tapering bodies. As has always been a strength in Doctor Who, the Sea Devils behave intelligently, not as lumbering ""man-in-suit"" monsters. Generally, they are used well, and it's refreshing to see them move quickly and agilely when they have to, pursuing the Doctor through the sea fort and capturing the Naval base as efficiently as any commando team...'  The creatures have a statuesque quality and, in the case of the Chief Sea Devil (the only one that speaks), a strange nobility imparted largely by Peter Forbes-Robertson's sensitive portrayal. They work very well in the action scenes, too, as they attack, get shot at and die in a variety of imaginative stunt falls - and even, on one occasion, a back-flip. Their weapons - silver, saucer-like discs that can blast or burn as required - are well designed and memorable, as Dallas Jones appreciated in A Voyage Through 25 Years of Doctor Who, dated December 1988: 'The gun itself I consider to be one of the most ingenious props in the series' history - simply because it doesn't look like a gun! It is so simple in appearance and [this] makes it seem all the more real.'  Another notable aspect of the story is that it showcases a wide variety of different forms of transport, including a motor boat, a scooter, a hovercraft, some one-man speedboats, a submarine, a diving vessel, a diving bell and a number of customised Citroens. This contributes greatly to its action-packed flavour. The same can be said also of the liberal use of stock footage of depth charges being laid and ships moving into attack; and so well integrated are these sequences with the location footage specially shot for the story that it is hard to see where one stops and the other starts. Apparently the Navy agreed to contribute to the production on condition that the story presented them in a good light, but given its underlying moral message - that blowing your perceived enemies to pieces might not always be the best solution - it is debatable whether or not they actually got their wish.  This moral dimension is a characteristic feature of Malcolm Hulke's stories. Here the viewer is presented with the plight of the reptiles, caught between the Master, the Doctor and the humans - who should they trust? Ultimately they are betrayed by all three, although it is the humans whose actions are shown to be the most irrational as the (admittedly somewhat clichßd) faceless civil servant Walker orders an attack on their base, thereby throwing away any chance of a peaceful solution to the conflict. The reptiles are left convinced that humanity is prepared to listen only to the language of violence.  Michael Briant's direction of the story is splendid, and the production values are high. The performances by all the leads are, as usual, excellent and believable, and the location work lends an air of reality to the proceedings. Perhaps the only area of contention is the incidental music, which is quite radically different from the norm for this period of Doctor Who's history - or indeed for any period. Radiophonic Workshop composer Malcolm Clarke, making his first contribution to the series, came up a score that can best be described as experimental. It is in effect a collection of atonal sounds that punctuate the action, in some parts melodic but in others simply a background noise (for example a low bubbling for the sequences set in the submarine). Opinions differ greatly as to the merits of this approach, but one thing that is certain is that no-one who watches The Sea Devils can possibly fail to miss what is arguably its most striking aspect."
319,"The firms said they will transfer their shares in the country's largest whaling fleet to public interest corporations.  Greenpeace claims it is global pressure from consumers that has forced the financial backers to pull out.  But the companies deny this and Japan's government says the transfer of shares will not affect its policies.  The companies own shares in a firm which operates seven of the eight ships in Japan's whaling fleet.  The new shareholders will include the Japanese government agency that promotes whaling. On the face of it this will not change much.  The Japanese fleet will continue to hunt for whales. But environmentalists insist this is a victory.  One of the private firms that is dumping its shares is a huge Japanese fishing company called Nissui.  Three months ago campaigners in Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and the United States began to put pressure on its subsidiaries, protesting against the parent company's connection with whaling.  Although Nissui like the other four firms says the campaign has nothing to do with its decision to pull out of the business, a statement from one of its subsidiaries expressed hope that it would shift the demonstrators' focus from the company.  Greenpeace activists, who harassed the Japanese whaling fleet earlier this year, said they had taken the fight from the high seas to the supermarket shelves.  Japan insists that efforts to hunt whales will be redoubled. From now on, whaling will be seen as something backed by the whole of Japan, not just private firms, an official said."
320,"Physicists have come up with an equation that explains and predicts the shape of a ponytail.  The report in Physical Review Letters journal could help scientists better understand natural materials, such as wool and fur.  The new equation takes into account the stiffness of hairs, the effects of gravity and the presence of random curliness or waviness.  The work was carried out by a British team of researchers.  ""It's a remarkably simple equation,"" explained Prof Raymond Goldstein, who is the Schlumberger Professor of Complex Physical Systems at Cambridge University.  He added that the findings showed how physics could be used to ""solve a problem that has puzzled scientists and artists ever since Leonardo da Vinci remarked on the fluid-like streamlines of hair in his notebooks 500 years ago"".  Prof Goldstein worked on the equation with Prof Robin Ball from the University of Warwick and Patrick Warren, from Unilever's Research and Development Centre.  The Ponytail Shape Equation represents the first scientific understanding of the distribution of hairs in a ponytail, say the researchers.  It provides new understanding of how a bundle is swollen by the outward pressure which arises from collisions between the component hairs.  Together with a new mathematical quantity known as the Rapunzel Number, the equation can - they say - be used to predict the shape of any ponytail.  It opens the way to a better understanding of materials made up of random fibres, say the researchers.  This will resonate with some in the computer graphics and animation industry, where a realistic representation of hair and fur has proven a tough challenge.  Prof Goldstein is presenting the research at the American Physical Society meeting in Boston on 28 February."
321,"Manchester United have become the first English club to win the European Cup beating Portuguese side Benfica by four goals to one.  Ten years after the Munich air crash, which killed eight of Matt Busby's young team, Manchester United have reached the pinnacle of European football.  Celtic became the first Scottish and British club to win the cup the previous year.  United's star player, George Best, was named European Footballer of the Year - just a fortnight after being named the football writers' Footballer of the Year.  Tonight's match at Wembley was watched by a crowd of 100,000 and an estimated 250 million TV viewers. It was the biggest television audience since the World Cup final two years before.  As both teams wear red kit, United opted to play in their blue away strip for the game.  The first half passed in a flurry of fouls before Bobby Charlton headed the opening goal in the second half to make it 1-0.  With only 10 minutes left to go, Benfica scored the equaliser - and very nearly won the match when their feared striker Eusebio broke away from Nobby Stiles, the player tasked with marking him, and blasted the ball towards the net.  But it was saved by keeper Alex Stepney and the game went into extra time.  Two minutes into extra time Best put United ahead again, slipping round the keeper and gently tapping it over the line.  It was followed by two more United goals, from 19-year-old Brian Kidd and captain Bobby Charlton, taking the final score to 4-1.  Manager Matt Busby said: ""They've done us proud. They came back with all their hearts to show everyone what Manchester United are made of. This is the most wonderful thing that has happened in my life and I am the proudest man in England tonight.""  Busby was seriously injured in the crash which claimed the lives of his so-called Busby Babes and there was speculation at the time that the club had been so badly damaged it would have to fold.  But they struggled on to complete the 1958/59 season and when Busby returned to the manager's role the following season he began the task of rebuilding the side.  The club won the league in 1965 and 1967, but today's win marks the pinnacle of the club's achievements.  Charlton and Bill Foulkes were the only survivors of the crash who played in today's final."
322,"Demolition work has begun at Heathrow Airport's Terminal 2 as part of a £1bn redevelopment.  Terminal 2, originally named Europa Building, was the west London airport's first terminal building when it opened in 1955.  The terminal, which handled eight million passengers each year, was closed to the public in 2009.  A new building will cater to 20 million passengers when it opens in 2013, airport operator BBA said.  The new terminal will be home to Star Alliance airlines.  By 2019 the new terminal will extend into the current Terminal 1 site to give a joint capacity of 30 million passengers.  Colin Matthews, chief executive of BAA, said: ""Heathrow is changing for the better, and there is much still to do.  ""Our brand new Terminal 2 will offer a better service to airlines and millions of passengers.""  Last September demolition work began on the airport's Queens Building, which housed offices of the airline companies.  Terminal 2 was built at a cost of £21m and designed by architect Frederick Gibberd, who also designed the old control tower, Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral and London Central Mosque.  The first non-stop flight from Heathrow to California took off from the 49,654 sqm terminal in 1957 and the building served as a port for long-haul flights for a time.  But after Terminal 3, also known as Oceanic Building, opened in 1961 long-haul flight operations moved there, leaving Terminal 2 to cater to short-haul flights.  In 1977 the terminal was connected to the London Underground network."
323,"Local scientists say it's now so badly damaged that another hurricane would simply sweep it away.  But they don't primarily blame hurricanes for the damage to the coral here on the Belize Barrier Reef; they blame climate change.  And they are backing a petition pressing the United Nations World Heritage Sites Committee to acknowledge that climate change is already damaging world heritage sites.  The five sites are the Belize Barrier reef, at 321km (200 miles) long, the biggest in the western hemisphere; the Australian barrier reef; and glacier parks in Nepal, Peru and the Rockies where glaciers are disappearing as the climate warms.  The World Heritage Sites Treaty stipulates that listed sites should not be damaged by signatories to the treaty, but it was mainly designed to protect the world's treasures in the event of wars.  The stakes are high because if the UN accepts the case, it might lead to poor countries attempting to sue rich countries for damages for the greenhouse gases they've emitted.  Scientists in Belize believe their case is strong. They say the 297km (185 mile) reef here has suffered more than 40% damage since 1998.  They particularly implicate three events of coral bleaching when water temperatures were high.  Corals get their colour from tiny single-cell plants - zooxanthellae - which provide for the reef-building creatures, the polyps.  When temperatures are very high for a protracted period, the zooxanthellae are driven away, the coral loses its colour, the polyps lose their food and so the reef is weakened.  The reefs then easily fall victim to the many forces that assail them - over-fishing, pollution, creatures that eat them, tourist snorkellers who inadvertently smother them with sand, and particularly the storm waves of hurricanes.  Local fishermen say there is no record of bleaching before 1998.  Billy Leslie, who runs the Hustler Dive School in San Pedro in northern Belize, said: ""My father was a commercial fisherman. He tells me that we have never heard of coral bleaching like this. It's a horrible sight to see; the coral just gets whiter and whiter every day.""  Richard Foster, a wildlife cameraman, said: ""I first started diving here in the early 80s and you just won't believe the difference with today. The corals were so thick they were competing with each other on the bottom. There was no space between the corals.  Dr Melanie McField, from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, US, has been studying the reefs for more than a decade.  She is confident that climate change is a key factor: ""On an annual basis, the sea temperatures in the Caribbean haven't changed much, but we are now registering prolonged periods of severe heating that we didn't see before.  ""When the water temperature is elevated we get a bleaching alert - and this coincides pretty accurately with the bleaching events.  ""The other big sign that the water temperatures are to blame rather than local pollution is that the bleaching episodes happen all over the Caribbean at the same time.""  Dr McField is angry that Belize has been working hard to protect its reefs but is suffering from a problem beyond its control.  She is also concerned about another major fear for the future of the corals - ocean acidification.  The Royal Society, the UK's academy of science, argued last year that so much CO2 from fossil-fuel burning was being absorbed into the oceans that surface waters were becoming acidified.  Research in Plymouth and Jerusalem shows that many species of corals are easily damaged by even a slight lowering of pH.  A small minority of coral researchers believe that fears over climate change and acidification have been exaggerated.  They argue that over time the reefs will adapt to warmer waters and that calcium littering the ocean floors will buffer the effects of acidification.  Dr McField accepts that reefs might eventually adapt but says this could take thousands of years.  In the meantime countries making money from reefs would suffer huge economic damage, she says.  Miguel Alamilla, who runs a marine protected area off the town of San Pedro, has a message for the big nations emitting greenhouse gases.  ""They need to open up and don't be egoistic but think globally,"" he said. ""Be aware that people are dependent on the coral reef and their livelihoods depend on that.  ""If it is destroyed what will happen to them?""  The UN campaigners believe these are powerful arguments in their favour.  They will face, though, determined resistance on the World Heritage Committee from the US. Objections to the petition include:"
324,"The 22-year-old became the youngest ever winner in Formula One, surpassing American Troy Ruttman, who won in the United States in 1952.  Not only did Alonso become the first Spaniard to win a grand prix, but he also delivered Renault's first victory since Alain Prost won in Australia 20 years ago.  He also became the eighth different winner this season, storming to his maiden victory in his 29th Grand Prix.  ""It is too many things at one time,"" Alonso said. ""The whole weekend was fantastic. First I got pole pole position and now the victory.  Alonso took full advantage of his pole position, establishing a huge lead in the early laps and only losing it once, briefly to Kimi Raikkonen, after the first round of pit stops.  ""For the first two or three laps I had Mark Webber in the mirror but after eight laps I asked my team where the others were,"" Alonso recalled.  ""They told me they were 15 seconds back and I thought, 'My God, I am very fast now!'  ""I pushed quite a lot in the first 15 laps to give myself a big advantage, and after that I took it more slowly.  Raikonnen, who finished second, did his world championship chances a power of good by reducing the gap on defending champion Michael Schumacher to two points.  Between them - only one point behind with three Grands Prix left - is Williams' Juan Pablo Montoya, who finished third.  ""I am quite happy with second place after starting from seventh,"" Raikkonen said.  ""It is better now for the championship and hopefully we can improve the car for the next race."""
325,"""The Japanese market is years ahead of Europe and the US,"" explained David Collier of Namco, one of the most successful Japanese mobile game publishers.  The games currently popular on mobiles in Japan hint at the sort of thing you could be playing on your phone in the future.  He told his audience of industry professionals that the quality of the games was improving all the time, as handsets pack more and more computing power.  One of the games on show was the console racing title, Ridge Racer, which has been adapted for the mobile.  ""You now have a PlayStation One game running on a mass market handset in Japan, delivering a fully interactive 3D game,"" said Mr Collier.  But gamers are being asked to pay a premium for such high quality games. Ridge Racer is being sold in Japan for $11, about double the price of other titles.  Other console games may soon appear on handsets, especially the older arcade type.  ""The game mechanics of arcade classics are perfect for mobile phone as they were designed for three-minute plays,"" explained Mr Collier.  The game uses the handset's camera to create food. When the pet is hungry, it shows a picture of a type of food like an apple.  You then have to take a picture of something red, which the phone interprets as an apple and feeds to your pet.  The game also lets you send food to a friend's pet via an infra-red connection.  Another virtual pet game uses a fingerprint scanner built into a handset to let your animal know that you are going to play with it, sending it into throes of joy.  Other games also make use of the camera on handsets. Mr Collier demonstrated a game which creates a fighting character based on your photo.  It interprets your image to give your character speed and power. You can then send this to a friend's mobile to do battle.  Another game uses a phone's microphone for educational purposes. The game is intended to help children with their pronunciation and works by comparing what they say with a sample on the handset.  Some of these games may sound typically Japanese, but Mr Collier believes the trend towards doing more with your handset is global.  ""Mobile culture is a mass market thing,"" Mr Collier told the Game Developers Conference being held in London this week.  ""It has gone mainstream. Everyone is checking their phones all the time and there is no reason why that should not happen here.""  The Game Developers Conference Europe runs at London's Earls Court conference centre until Friday.  It is part of London Games Week, which brings together a range of industry and consumer events around the capital."
326,"When the prehistoric site at Fiskerton in Lindisfarne was first excavated in 1981, archaeologists found part of a human skull lying among the swords, spears, tools and other items that had been placed along the causeway. It represented the back of a man's head and was badly damaged. Fissured Fred, as the skeleton became known by the excavators, had been hit by a sword, which had taken out a chip of his skull. Other than a couple of bones, the rest of Fissured Fred was never found, so there is no further evidence of how he met his death. The sword blow by itself would not have killed him, but it was inflicted around the time of his death 2,500 years ago. Was Fissured Fred a human sacrifice? We shall probably never know for certain... Was Fissured Fred a human sacrifice? We shall probably never know for certain but there is circumstantial evidence to suggest he was. His remains were mixed up with weapons and equipment, which had themselves been sacrificed and thrown into the water. The evidence for human sacrifice in this period of the Iron Age is most prolific in Denmark, Germany and Holland, where many bodies have been found completely preserved in peat bogs. Some were hanged or strangled, the noose still around their neck, and others were bludgeoned on the head or had their throat slit. They too, like Fissured Fred, were found in special places, where people had made offerings to an afterworld. It seems clear that these were not murders, but deliberate, socially sanctioned, killings. Writing much later, in the first century AD, the Roman historian Tacitus tells us that these Germanic peoples executed their social outcasts - cowards, shirkers and those of disrepute - by pressing them down into bogs. So were these bog victims in fact executions and not sacrifices? If such a distinction could be drawn between the two, it does seem most likely that they were sacrifices, because bogs were places where other, inanimate offerings were made.  Julius Caesar and other Romans were appalled by the custom of human sacrifice among the Celts. 'They used to strike a human being, devoted to death, in the back with a sword, and then divine from his death struggle,' wrote Strabo. According to Diodorus Siculus, the Gauls 'kill a man by a knife-stab in the region above the midriff, and after his fall they foretell the future by the convulsions of his limbs and the pouring of his blood'. Julius Caesar and other Romans were appalled by the custom of human sacrifice among the Celts. Yet the Romans had double standards; although human sacrifice had ended in Rome a century earlier, gladiatorial games and feeding people to lions were regular sport, whilst many thousands of conquered Celts in Gaul were victims of Roman atrocities, such as cutting off their hands and feet and leaving them to die slowly. By accusing the Celts of practicing human sacrifice, the Romans thought they had an excuse for their own unlicensed cruelty. ...people may have been selected for sacrifice because they had been 'touched by the gods'. The Romans reserved their comments about sacrifice to the Celts and Germans, with no reference to such practices in the British Isles. Bog bodies have been found in Britain, however, which indicates that human lives were sacrificed to the gods in these islands too. Three bog bodies (or parts of them), for example, were found in Lindow Moss in Cheshire, dating from the beginning of the Roman period. The best preserved of the three was a man who had been hit on the head with sufficient force to detach chips of his skull into his brain, and to crack a molar. His throat had been slit and there was also a leather garrotte, tightened with a slip-knot, around his neck. He was almost naked except for a fox-fur armband and, amongst his stomach contents of burnt bread was pollen of mistletoe, a plant sacred to the Celts and Britons. One member of the investigating team thought that this was an ancient murder rather than a ritual killing, but this seems unlikely in the light of the body's context. Of the two other bodies, one was very unusual in having a sixth finger. A surprising proportion of bog bodies from northern Europe have physical defects - such as spinal abnormalities or foreshortened limbs - and these people may have been selected for sacrifice because they had been 'touched by the gods'.  Human sacrifice requires the exchange of a life - willingly or not - in return for supernatural assistance or for a greater cause. Exactly where we draw the line between altruism and coercion is not always clear, as a surviving account of a Viking's funeral in Russia in AD 921-2 makes plain: 'The dead man's slave girls were asked who wished to die with him; one volunteered to be burned in his ship with him... When she went to her death the men began to strike with the sticks on the shields so that her cries could not be heard and the other slave-girls would not be frightened and seek to escape death with their masters... a dagger was plunged between her ribs repeatedly, and the men strangled her with the cord until she was dead... The flames grew and engulfed the pyre and the ship.' Mass human sacrifices were particularly a feature of ancient states whose dead leaders required their courtiers and followers to accompany them into the afterworld. Human sacrifice was practiced at least 5,000 years ago among the early agricultural societies of Europe. Danish farmers sacrificed their stone axes and flint tools, their amber jewellery and their food, by depositing them in pots, together with human offerings, in bogs. Probably the earliest case in the world is that of two girls found at Sigersdal near Copenhagen, killed about 3500 BC. One was about 16 while the other, who was about 18, still had a cord around her neck. Mass human sacrifices were particularly a feature of ancient states whose dead leaders required their courtiers and followers to accompany them into the afterworld. The tombs of the first dynasty of Egyptian pharaohs (3100-2890 BC) were each surrounded by the graves of their courtiers. In the royal tombs of ancient Mesopotamia the courtiers - guards, musicians, handmaidens and grooms - died at their posts in the tomb, having taken a lethal draught of poison. Some of the largest mass sacrifices accompanying dead rulers are the royal tombs of the African kingdom of Kerma, around 1500 BC, where 500 people at a time were buried in huge grave pits next to the dead king, and covered by a large mound. Around the same date, the royal tombs of the Shang Dynasty at Anyang in China were similarly provided with sacrificed bodies. In the second century BC, workers and soldiers were buried in the tomb of the first Chinese emperor and, in addition, he was provided with an other-worldly army of terracotta substitute soldiers.  The ancient civilisations of the Americas are also well known for their human sacrifices. Aztec priests believed that the sacrifices they performed in the temples on top of pyramids - cutting out the still-beating heart of their victims with the blood flowing down the steps of the pyramid - were necessary to keep the sun on its daily path. More than 100 warriors were sacrificed and buried beneath the foundations of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuacan in Mexico, around AD 150, possibly as supernatural guardians of this Aztec temple. Within the Inca empire of South America, children and teenagers were sacrificed to the sun god... Within the Inca empire of South America, children and teenagers were sacrificed to the sun god, bestowing considerable prestige on the child's parents and on their local community. Some of these children's bodies have been found on the summits of sacred mountains, where the freezing conditions have ensured their perfect preservation. There is evidence that human sacrifice still continues today in isolated parts of the world, and researchers have known cases where it is practiced by shamans on behalf of people - including cocaine traffickers - seeking to avert natural disasters or to improve their wealth. Earlier this year in London, an archaeologist was brought in as an expert by the Metropolitan Police to help them identify a southern-African style ritual killing thought to be a human sacrifice.  We have to remember that human sacrifice is not just a ritual act designed to appease the gods, divine the future, or bring luck and prosperity to those offering the sacrifice. It covers all situations in which a human life is exchanged for a greater cause. Even religious belief is not a necessary requirement; hunger-strikers are prepared to die for their nationalism, whilst Kamikaze pilots died for their emperor in World War Two. ...human sacrifice has been with us for more than 5,000 years... Some anthropologists interpret the executions of condemned men and women on death row in America as another form of sacrifice, perceived as removing evil and thereby cleansing American society. The suicide bombers of Palestine and the 11 September terrorists are also modern-day human sacrifices. If the idea seems unpalatable, we have to remember that one of the major world religions, Christianity, is constructed in the image of a sacrificed man-god who is said to have died to save humankind. Whether we like it or not, human sacrifice has been with us for more than 5,000 years and, in the form of altruistic suicide, is one of the many characteristics that distinguish us from other animals.  Dr Mike Parker-Pearson is a reader in the Department of Archaeology & Prehistory at Sheffield University, and was formerly an inspector of Ancient Monuments for English Heritage. He has been studying human sacrifice since working on his PhD research, which was on burials and bog bodies in Iron Age Denmark, and he has written two books on the archaeology of death. His fieldwork in the last decade has been in the Western Isles of Scotland (where prehistoric skeletons buried as foundation deposits have just been discovered), and in the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar."
327,"They have condemned a British National Party (BNP) leaflet opposing it and believe the Muslim community centre would strengthen race relations.  Muslims in Swansea bought the former St Andrews United Reformed Church from a private owner in 1997.  They aim to have it renovated and open within two years.  Arjan Ali, one of the project co-ordinators, said once complete it would be a centre for use by everyone in the city.  ""The money used to buy the building was raised by the Muslim community and the charity has kept it safe and secure for the last six or seven years,"" he said.  ""When we took on the building it was derelict. People had been using it for taking drugs. They were breaking into it and starting fires.  ""It is one of the most beautiful ecclesiastical buildings in Swansea and we are working to restore it.""  Mr Ali said the present mosque, just yards from the church on St Helen's Road, did not have enough room or facilities for the community.  ""A lot of the stuff that we want to do we can't because there is not the space. We want to focus on three areas - the youth, women and elderly,"" he added.  ""For the youth we are planning homework clubs, mentoring programmes, indoor recreational activities for both boys and girls - the sorts of things the Brownies or Cubs do.""  There are plans for crèche facilities, mother and toddler groups, social activities and English classes for women.  ""One of the things we have noticed with the elderly is that help and support is there but Asians in particular are not accessing services such as meals-on-wheels.  He said people from all ethnic backgrounds or religious beliefs would be welcome.  ""One of the biggest causes or racial tension is where communities ghettoize into groups but we believe we can achieve something for ourselves and the wider community.""  Mr Ali said the leaflet, which the BNP claims to have posted to about 1,000 homes around the mosque, had caused offence among Muslims and non-Muslims alike.  ""The whole purpose of that leaflet is to create tension. There was some highly offensive stuff,"" he said.  ""I have been surprised by the strength of support from the non-Muslim community since it appeared. There is wide support for what we are doing.""  Police confirmed last week the BNP leaflet was being looked at by the Crown Prosecution Service.  The party has denied trying to stir up hatred and has argued it should be allowed to debate the mosque issue without fear of arrest."

Their future is to be sealed by proposed laws forbidding the giving of animals as prizes.  As well as worries about the standard of their care while waiting for their new home and, indeed, once they found it, the government believes winning an animal as a prize is ""not thought to be consistent with a responsible approach to becoming an owner"".  As one commentator remarked: ""[The new owner] may be good at darts or hoop-la, but that does not qualify them as fish-keepers.""  In other words, the basic principles of goldfish-owning etiquette, such as cleaning out the bowl and making feeding arrangements for holidays, could be overlooked.  Friends will no doubt have seen an early sign of Prize Goldfish in a Bag's demise in the refusal of many local authorities to grant the necessary licences to fairgrounds.

329,"Ms Halford, 65, once Britain's highest-ranking woman police officer, was AM for Delyn between 1999 and 2003.  Ms Halford, who will advise Tories on policing and social justice matters said: ""I have been disillusioned with Tony Blair's leadership.""  A Welsh Labour spokesperson said Ms Halford's former constituents would not forget ""Tory misrule in Wales"".  Ms Halford will advise Shadow Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan on policing matters, including the merger of the four Welsh forces.  She will also advise Tory assembly group leader Nick Bourne and policy director David Melding on policy, particularly on social justice issues.  Ms Halford, from Flintshire, joined the Labour Party in 1994 after a 30-year career in the police in which she rose to become assistant chief constable of the Merseyside force.  She stood down from front-line politics at the last assembly election in 2003.  She said: ""I left the Labour Party over the issue of cronyism when Peter Mandelson was given yet another chance by being appointed a European Commissioner.  ""Trust in politicians is important and I have lost all faith in the prime minister.""  ""It is now time for Labour to go and for the newly-led, more compassionate Conservative Party to be given the chance to govern.  ""I want to play my part in helping the Conservative Party achieve this important objective.""  She added: ""I very much look forward to working with Cheryl Gillan and Nick Bourne, whom I have always held in high regard.""  Nick Bourne, the Tories' leader in the assembly, said he was ""delighted"" Ms Halford had joined the party.  He added: ""She has had distinguished careers in the police force and as an assembly member and is a person who rightly commands the utmost respect.  ""Alison's decision to join the Conservatives is further evidence of the progress the party is making under David Cameron's leadership.  ""The fact that people of Alison's calibre and background have joined the Conservatives is a clear sign that Tony Blair's Labour Party is increasingly out of touch with the British public.""  Ms Gillan said she was ""looking forward"" to working with Ms Halford.  A Welsh Labour spokesperson said: ""Alison Halford will have her work cut out advising the Conservatives on social justice.  ""The party of which she is now a member gave Britain three million unemployed, two recessions and massive cuts to front line public services.  ""Alison may look back through rose-tinted glasses at the 18 long years of Tory misrule in Wales, but the people she used to represent won't so easily forget."""
330,"Click here for the full list of Sports Personality of the Year winners By today's standards, it did not cost very much when it was first created. But, three decades later, the trophy presented annually to the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year is now considered priceless. That is because this silver-plated four-turret lens camera, which cost around £1,000 when it was created in the 1950s, has become part of British sporting folklore. Along the way the trophy has found its way on to the mantelpieces of, among others, Jim Laker, Stirling Moss, Bobby Moore, Ian Botham and Lennox Lewis.    They are flabbergasted when they get it    Chris White, senior sports studio manager at the BBC, has worked on 10 Sports Review of the Year programmes. He told BBC Sport Online a little about the history of the trophy itself. ""It used to have one plinth on it but it's now got three, because over the years we just had to keep adding another plinth to put little shields on. ""So it's now probably about six to eight inches taller than it was originally."" he said. The trophy presented to this year's winner will be the original which was given to the first winner, athlete Chris Chataway, in 1954. But, since 1981, there has been a replica. That was the year Ian Botham won and, because the cricketer was in Australia for the winter, an identical trophy had to be on hand Down Under as the votes came in. ""So now we have two"", said White. ""The original one is always there on the night, and you can't tell the difference unless you rub your hand on the bottom because the original one has a hole there!"" Winners keep the original trophy for around eight or nine months, before the BBC collects it to prepare for the next show. Perhaps surprisingly, the trophy has never been lost or come back damaged. It is nevertheless given a polish and a clean and on the night is presented to that year's winner. But they do not take it with them immediately. Instead their name has to be engraved on - the Sports Review team never like to put the name on ahead of their show even when they know who has won. That can lead to problems, such as in 1999 when Muhammad Ali was given the Sports Personality of the Century prize. The former heavyweight boxing champion was returning to America the following morning and wanted to take his trophy with him. So a quick dash to the engravers as soon as they opened on Monday was necessary! Normally there is a bit more time to spare and the award is engraved before Christmas. ""It will be delivered to them, deliberately, just before Christmas"", said White. ""It's one of these strange things where a lot of people actually want it to put on their Christmas table."" Senior sports studio manager White is always enjoys watching the reaction of the winner. He said: ""You've only got to go back to Steve Redgrave's speech last year. He was absolutely overwhelmed that he'd won this thing. ""Even though he'd won five gold medals he saw it as the pinnacle. ""He said he'd been coming to Sports Review of the Year for many years and now he'd won it. They are flabbergasted when they get it, which is a nice reaction after all these years of the programme."""
331,"By Joan Baxter in Mali An African emperor who ruled Mali in the 14th century discovered America nearly 200 years before Christopher Columbus, according to a book to be launched this month. Abubakari II ruled what was arguably the richest and largest empire on earth - covering nearly all of West Africa.    Our aim is to bring out hidden parts of history    According to a Malian scholar, Gaoussou Diawara in his book, 'The Saga of Abubakari II...he left with 2000 boats', the emperor gave up all power and gold to pursue knowledge and discovery. Abubakari's ambition was to explore whether the Atlantic Ocean - like the great River Niger that swept through Mali - had another 'bank'. In 1311, he handed the throne over to his brother, Kankou Moussa, and set off on an expedition into the unknown. His predecessor and uncle, Soundjata Keita, had already founded the Mali empire and conquered a good stretch of the Sahara Desert and the great forests along the West African coast. The book also focuses on a research project being carried out in Mali tracing Abubakari's journeys. ""We are not saying that Abubakari II was the first ever to cross the ocean,"" says Tiemoko Konate, who heads the project ""There is evidence that the Vikings were in America long before him, as well as the Chinese,"" he said. The researchers claim that Abubakari's fleet of pirogues, loaded with men and women, livestock, food and drinking water, departed from what is the coast of present-day Gambia. They are gathering evidence that in 1312 Abubakari II landed on the coast of Brazil in the place known today as Recife. ""Its other name is Purnanbuco, which we believe is an aberration of the Mande name for the rich gold fields that accounted for much of the wealth of the Mali Empire, Boure Bambouk."" Another researcher, Khadidjah Djire says they have found written accounts of Abubakari's expedition in Egypt, in a book written by Al Omari in the 14th century. ""Our aim is to bring out hidden parts of history"", she says. Mr Konate says they are also examining reports by Columbus, himself, who said he found black traders already present in the Americas. They also cite chemical analyses of the gold tips that Columbus found on spears in the Americas, which show that the gold probably came from West Africa. But the scholars say the best sources of information on Abubakari II are Griots - the original historians in Africa. Mr Diawara says the paradox of Abubakari II, is that the Griots themselves imposed a seal of silence on the story. ""The Griots found his abdication a shameful act, not worthy of praise,"" Mr Diawara said. ""For that reason they have refused to sing praise or talk of this great African man."" Mr Diawara says the Griots in West Africa such as Sadio Diabate, are slowly starting to divulge the secrets on Abubakari II. But the research team says an even bigger challenge is to convince hard-nosed historians elsewhere that oral history can be just as accurate as written records. Mr Diawara believes Abubakari's saga has an important moral lesson for leaders of small nation states in West Africa, which were once part of the vast Mande-speaking empire. ""Look at what's going on in all the remnants of that empire, in Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea. ""Politicians are bathing their countries in blood, setting them on fire just so that they can cling to power,"" says Mr Diawara. ""They should take an example from Abubakari II. He was a far more powerful man than any of them. And he was willing to give it all up in the name of science and discovery."" ""That should be a lesson for everyone in Africa today,"" concludes Mr Diawara."
332,"A South African man has become the first person ever to swim from the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland to the north Antrim coast in Northern Ireland.  Wayne Soutter, 43, who now lives and works in England, set off on the North Channel swim at 11:19 BST on Sunday.  He came ashore at Kenbane Head between Ballycastle and Ballintoy shortly before 23:30 BST on Sunday.  He was then taken to Ballycastle harbour to a welcoming reception.  Wayne told Good Morning Ulster why he had decided to embark on the swim and recalled the conditions he encountered.  ""I thought it was interesting to try something that had never been done,"" he said.  ""I was not afraid before the swim, but about halfway through the swim I really started getting quite scared.  ""The tides and the winds were ferocious, there were times the boat was spinning in 180 degree circles.  ""The tides were crossing each other and spinning the boat around.""  He said he struggled with the cold conditions which he experienced.  ""When you get cold, you get depressed and it was so hard,"" he added.  ""At one point I was feeling so down, the only way to feel better was to swim harder.""  His training had included a one-hour swim off the Northern Ireland coast which had allowed him to gauge currents and test his resilience to jellyfish stings.  ""There were times I was in a field of jellyfish, everywhere I looked there were jellyfish,"" he said.  ""I just had to put my head down and swim through them it was awful.""  Wayne, was raising money for the Community Rescue Service, through his swim. He conquered the English Channel on his first attempt in 2012.  Apart from the aforementioned jellyfish, the South African had to battle six feet waves as he approached his destination. The swim should be about 20 km in length if taken in a straight direction, but due to the the nature of the tide it was about 45km."
333,"An overview of the plan for the 2012 Olympics in London. On 15 March 2007 the government announced the budget for the Games had risen from £2.4bn to £9.35bn, although she said the cost of the Games would be £5.3bn. New venues will cost £3.1bn. These include the Olympic Park at Stratford and the athletes' village. There will be £1.7bn spent on regeneration and infrastructure. £600m will be spent on extra security. The government has set aside £2.7bn in a contingency fund in case costs rise further. The Olympics will have to pay an £840m tax bill. £390m will be spent on other costs, such as the Paralympics and community sport. Income: The government will provide £6bn, with other funds coming from London council tax payers and the National Lottery. Further income will come from International Olympic Committee TV and marketing deals (£560m); sponsorship and official suppliers (£450m); ticket revenues (£300m); licensing (£60m); London Development Agency (£250m) There will be 9.6 million tickets for sale - 8 million for the Olympics and 1.6 million for the Paralympics. Organisers say 75% of all tickets will cost less than £50 and offer free travel on London transport. A sell-out rate of 82% for the Olympic Games and 63% for the Paralympics is estimated. Tickets for the athletics will start at £15 and there will be 20,000 £10 tickets for the Olympic Park to watch events on big screens. An aerial view of London's planned Olympic Park for 2012    Olympic Village   The village will have 17,320 beds and provide each athlete with 16 square metres' floor space. Each apartment will have a TV, internet access, a private courtyard. The dining hall will cater for 5,500 athletes at a time. The Olympic Village Polyclinic will be converted into a lifelong learning centre for the east London community, with a nursery, primary and secondary schools. The village will be converted into 3,600 apartments. Most of them will be affordable housing. The media and press centre would become a creative industries centre for east London. After the Games four arenas would be 'deconstructed' and relocated to other parts of the UK along with the swimming pools that are used for water polo and the 50m training pools. Charities will be given the sports equipment used in the Games for free. Tessa Jowell will be Olympics Minister, responsible for delivering the Games. Government will create an Olympic Delivery Authority to ensure delivery of Olympic infrastructure and new venues. There will also be a Cabinet-level Olympic Security Committee to co-ordinate all security planning. 80% of athletes would be within 20 minutes of their events and 97% of athletes within 30 minutes of their events. 93% of training venues are to be within 30 minutes of the athletes village. The aim is for 90% of venues to be served by three or more forms of public transport. There will be two major park and ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars, within 25 minutes of the Olympic Park. There are 9,000 planned park and ride spaces to be made available at Ebbsfleet where spectators can board a 10-minute shuttle service to the Olympic Park. This is the same station where continental spectators travelling by Eurostar will join the shuttle to the Olympic Park. It is predicted that on event days 78% of spectators are likely to travel from within London and 22% from the rest of the UK and Europe. Organisers estimate 80% of visitors and staff of the Games will use rail services to reach the Olympic Park. Low or no-emission vehicles will be used to transport Olympic athletes and officials. A tri-generation plant will supply electricity, heat and chilled water to the Olympic Park using technology which produces 33% lower CO2 emissions than from the electricity grid. By 2012 it is estimated that over 135,000 hotel rooms will be available within 50km of the Olympic Park, up from 120,000 presently. According to London 2012, for the first time in any Games live Olympic backdrop presentation facilities will be available to broadcast rights holders via rooftop studios on the main press centre with a direct view of the Olympic Stadium and Park.

335,"Click here for more Eagle Works information > In the summer of 1984 Fine Art students from Wolverhampton Polytechnic cycled the length and breadth of Wolverhampton. They were looking for a building that they could use as a group studio. They eventually settled upon the Eagle Works in Alexander Street, Graiseley, Wolverhampton – a  three storey semi-derelict Victorian industrial building with smashed windows and a friendly landlord. Wolverhampton’s Heritage and History Society believe that before falling into disuse and disrepair, the building was used as a mattress factory, a bicycle factory, and a brass and gun metal foundry. Assisted by small grants from the Arts Council, the Eagle Works Visual Arts Group converted the shell of a building into individual studio spaces. In 1987 they opened a gallery at Eagle Works where they exhibit their work. In 2005, the building provides working space for 18 local, mostly “research based”, contemporary artists. There’s a waiting list of artists who’d like a studio at Eagle Works. George Holt, Simon Francis, Simon Harris, Sylbert Bolton, Jane O’Reilly, Derek Jones, Julie McNally-Hayes, John Hampton, Knighton Hosking, David Smith, Rupert Miles Smithson, James Millichamp, Jain McKay, Dave Hilliard, Giancarlo Facchinetti, Maggie Walker and Rosemary Terry are the emerging and established contemporary artists who work from the building at present. Although the members of the Eagle Works Visual Arts Group mostly produce abstract paintings, name a style, a medium or a concept and someone in the group will be working in that area. Apart from painting, the Eagle Works group also produces sculpture, conceptual art, montage and video installation. Although the group has produced no household names so far, it is a respected studio. Eagle Works artists have received public commissions. Their work is collected. In 2005, the gallery space at Eagle Works held ten exhibitions of the group’s work. They’re planning a new exhibition programme for 2006, possibly a series of dual shows. “It must be one of the most stable and long lasting artists’ studios in the whole country.” says sculptor Rosemary Terry, who’s worked from the building for nearly 20 years.  “When the place started up people tended to come for a year or two and then move on elsewhere. I think we have a population of artists now who are settled in the area because they have jobs, they work here, or maybe they’re even retired – so that’s one reason why the place is still here.” “We’ve been around a long time. We have, often, advertised nationally in the past. We’ve had national and international artists showing in our gallery in the past. “I don’t think any of us would regard ourselves as commercial artists. If we do sell work that’s a good by-product of our practice. This is space to work and is also space to fraternise with other artists, be able to operate collectively and have group shows. “We’re all modern artists because we all live now. We’re definitely not chocolate box artists, and we wouldn’t necessarily encourage chocolate box artists or people who make landscapes paintings to come here. And I don’t think they’d want to either, because it’s a pretty basic building. “It’s cold it’s damp – but because it’s [Eagle Works] an industrial building there’s 24 hour access, people can make as much noise and mess as they want to, in the course of producing work – so, from that point of view it’s just right for fine artists.” Entry to the Eagle Works building is by invitation only.  Telephone 01902 425958 or email eagle@eagleworks.org.uk for more information."
336,"A wind farm near Glasgow has become the first wind energy project in Scotland to join a major tourist attraction body.  Managers of the visitor centre at Whitelee, Eaglesham, agreed to become members of the Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions (ASVA).  They took the decision after recording nearly 250,000 visitors at Europe's largest onshore wind farm since 2009.  The centre is run by ScottishPower Renewables and Glasgow Science Centre.  The move comes despite recent claims by US tycoon Donald Trump that wind farm developments would kill off tourism in Scotland.  Whitelee's £2m visitor centre includes interactive displays and exhibitions and a learning hub staffed by personnel from Glasgow Science Centre.  ScottishPower Renewables said nearly 10,000 pupils had visited Whitelee so far as part of school trips.  The company said in addition to centre visits, at least another 100,000 people had accessed the wind farm's 90km (56 miles) of trails for recreational purposes such as jogging and cycling.  Project director John Alexander said: ""We are very pleased that Whitelee Wind Farm will be joining Scotland's top tourist attractions as a fully fledged member of the ASVA.  ""It is fantastic that people have shown so much interest in the wind farm, and it has surpassed all of our expectations.  ""One of our key priorities when building the wind farm was to ensure that it was accessible, and that people could enjoy interacting with it.""  Tourism Minister Fergus Ewing said he welcomed the wind farm's decision to join ASVA.  ""Whitelee is creating new opportunities for a wide range of outdoor leisure activities to the south of Glasgow through improved access, a popular visitor centre and great linkages into the education community,"" he commented.  In April, a survey commissioned by VisitScotland suggested tourists visiting Scotland did not see wind farms as a problem.  The agency reported that about 80% of respondents said a wind farm would not affect their decision about where to take a holiday."
337,"      BBC orchestra silenced at the Barbican and on Radio 3          The BBC Symphony Orchestra (SO) gives the first orchestral performance in the UK of John Cage's seminal silent work 4'33"" in the opening concert of its forthcoming annual Composer Weekend at the Barbican on Friday (16 January 2004).    BBC Radio 3 is broadcasting the performance live and is the first broadcaster to risk airing nearly five minutes of ambient silence, with BBC FOUR broadcasting it an hour later.    Radio 3's emergency backup systems, designed to cut in when there is apparent silence on air, are to be switched off.    4'33"" demonstrates Cage's view that all sound is music and that, ""Wherever we are what we hear mostly is noise"".    He wrote: ""… When we ignore noise, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating.""    This is just one of the events in the BBC's forthcoming John Cage Uncaged at the Barbican from Friday 16 to Sunday 18 January, a packed weekend of concerts, talks, films and 'happenings' to celebrate the life, influences and legacy of this maverick musician, writer, artist, mushroom expert and cultural icon who died in 1992.    The weekend also includes the largest ever Musicircus to be staged in Europe with more than 345 people divided into 51 groups performing simultaneously or carrying out various actions in unexpected places throughout the Barbican in two separate 45-minute events on Saturday afternoon.    Just some of the sonic collisions taking place include Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones playing a flashing bass guitar, members of the BBC Symphony Chorus having a dinner party on the foyer, amplified cacti (kindly lent to the BBC by Kew Gardens), one man playing five tubas connected by 16 feet of tubing and singers disguised as Barbican staff who will sing information to you.    There will be a host of well known groups and performers from Piano Circus to Chinese Erhu player Tzy-Tau Weh and Pete Cooper's Irish Band to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama Percussion Ensemble, who also give a late night Barbican Hall concert featuring Cage's great works for percussion.    Among the other highlights are an 18-hour performance of Erik Satie's marathon piano work Vexations given by more than 50 pianists from top classical performers and composers to jazz stars Django Bates and Julian Joseph.    There will also be a performance of material from Cage's Songbooks which involves sopranos Frances M Lynch and Nicole Tibbels, along with pianist Rolf Hind, drinking gin, eating crisps, playing cards and having a party, as well as singing.    The BBC SO's annual January Composer Weekends at the Barbican have become highlights in London's musical life, bringing the music of leading twentieth, and now twenty-first century, composers to the fore in a concentrated festival.    The January Weekends offer an unrivalled retrospective of musicians who have shaped the course of classical music and have recently included Alfred Schnittke, John Adams and Mark-Anthony Turnage.    John Cage Uncaged promises to be one of the most spectacular January Weekends yet with various artists and ensembles joining the BBC Symphony Orchestra for events in the Barbican Hall, foyers and conservatory, St Giles Cripplegate and LSO St Luke's.    Five Barbican Hall concerts feature an extensive range of music by Cage and the BBC Symphony Chorus gives the world premiere of Cage's Variations I for Stephen Montague (1958/90), realised by the dedicatee.    To set Cage in his context there's music by his American predecessors and heroes.    Works that will surprise by Antheil, Cowell and Ives alongside the mainstream as represented by Copland, Schuman and Alan Hovhaness while his contemporaries and successors are represented by the members of the New York School: Brown, Feldman and Wolff.    The weekend also includes a line-up of talks with an introduction to the mushroom garden by leading gardening expert Sefan Buczacki taking place in the weekend's very own mushroom garden.    There will also be a panel discussion examining Cage's legacy and films including Elliot Caplan's portrait of Cage and his relationship with his life-long companion Merce Cunningham and Peter Greenaway's insightful hour-long film.    Much of the weekend is broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and there is a host of features, interval talks and discussions to complement the music.    The opening concert is broadcast on BBC FOUR.

338,"Medics are to be used on the London Underground to help speed up the response when passengers fall ill.  Transport for London (TfL) said the move would enable faster response times to help reduce service delays.  Twenty British Transport Police (BTP) officers have been trained and have access to two fast response vehicles to enable them to reach incidents quickly.  TfL said a third of all delays on the Tube were passenger incidents, with ill people accounting for most of these.  The specially-trained officers will also assist any people trapped on trains in tunnels or at other locations.  The officers, who have undertaken an intensive four-week course in pre-hospital care paid for by TfL, will be on duty every day between 07:00 and 23:00.  They will be working at various locations as part of a year-long trial which starts on 28 May.

Festival-goers agreed something - perhaps the unique atmosphere - was missing from Hengrove and were delighted to have the event back at the North Somerset estate.      Kevin Rooney from the festival said: ""We had a bit of a let down at Hengrove last year. People didn't come, so we lost a lot of money.  ""Now we're back up here and everyone's come back. We're back home again and it's fantastic.""  For the first time the festival had corporate sponsorship and charged a £3 entry fee - in the past all donations at the gates had been voluntary.  Organisers were also relying on the good weather to ensure a good turnout, and they were not disappointed.    Kosheen    Big name acts like Reef, Kosheen and Bad Manners attracted the usual diverse audience who also enjoyed sets by local bands.  A plethora of food outlets, stalls selling the usual festival wares (silly hats, herbal remedies, henna tattoos and even body piercings) occupied visitors between bands.  But most people were there to party - and that's exactly what they did...  The success of BCF 2002 has brought it back into the black and secured its survival for future generations of festival-goers."

""This ensures that consumers can continue to enjoy their favourite BBC titles on DVD and Blu-ray as well as protecting the investment made by BBC Worldwide in 2Entertain over the past six years,"" BBC Worldwide added.  It said the funds for the deal did not come from television licence fees. and that the sale offered stability to 2Entertain's retail partners.  Paul Dempsey, boss of 2Entertain, said the firm looked forward ""to a more settled period and playing an important role in BBC Worldwide's future plans"".  Woolworths entered administration in November 2008 with debts of £385m.  But the DVD publishing firm did not go into administration and remained profitable throughout."
341,"The 30-year-old moves to United on a free transfer, after a clause in his contract enabled him to leave after Swindon's relegation to League Two.  Meanwhile, veteran defender Steve Jenkins will not be offered a new contract by Swindon when his current deal expires at the end of June.  The 34-year-old is now free to leave the County Ground.  Cureton told BBC Essex: ""There's been a lot of speculation and I'm glad it's all sorted now. Being here last season has played a massive part in my coming back.  ""It's not like joining a new club and the fans were good to me last season. I'd have been happy to stay until the end of last season but Swindon wanted me back and I went and did a professional job and tried my hardest to keep the club up.  ""I think Colchester are a club where I feel comfortable and settled and when that happens I play my best football and it's a nice close knit club and I'm happy to be a part of it again."""
342,"The eight-legged marine animals, which are known as pycnogonids, are only distantly related to land spiders.  The stunning specimens were discovered in 160 million-year-old fossil beds at La Voulte-sur-Rhone, near Lyon in south-eastern France.  Details of the finds are published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.  Sea spiders are still with us today; scientists have described about 1,300 species of pycnogonid. They are characterised by eight extremely long legs and a prominent mouthpart.  While they may resemble land spiders, the pycnogonids form a distinct biological group.  Writing in Proceedings B, Sylvain Charbonnier from the University of Lyon, France, and colleagues say the new fossils fill a 400 million-year gap in our knowledge of these enigmatic creatures.  The team identified 70 sea spiders from three distinct species in rock slabs from the Jurassic La Voulte Lagerstatte. A Lagerstatte is a sedimentary rock bed rich in fossils or containing well-preserved specimens.  ""This Lagerstatte is very important because during Jurassic times the water here was about 200m deep,"" Mr Charbonnier told the BBC News website.  Many other Lagerstatten from the Mesozoic - the era of the geological time when the dinosaurs walked the Earth - were formed from lagoons or relatively shallow bodies of water. This means that La Voulte Lagerstatte preserved many fossil creatures not found elsewhere."
343,"Princess Diana's former lover James Hewitt has spoken out to end persistent rumours that he is Prince Harry's father.  The former cavalry officer said people compared Harry's looks with his own, but he stated categorically: ""There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father.  ""I can absolutely assure you that I am not.""  Prince Harry was ""already walking"" by the time his relationship with Diana began, he told The Sunday Mirror.  Mr Hewitt was Diana Princess of Wales's secret lover for five years.  Speaking in the paper, he said: ""Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine and people say we look alike.  ""I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time I must state once and for all that I'm not Harry's father.  ""When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.""  Referring to portraits by fashion photographer Mario Testino, taken to mark the Prince's 18th birthday a week ago, Hewitt said: ""Looking at the pictures I have to say he's a much more handsome chap than I ever was.""  He said he was aware the issue of Harry's paternity had been a major talking point.  However, he said he did not meet the Princess, who died in 1997, until two years after Harry was born.  In a book by Diana's former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, the rumours are also quashed.  Mr Wharfe said the gossip used to upset the Princess.  He said in his book: ""The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly.  ""The nonsense should be scotched here and now.  ""Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait."""
344,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. You might not think you know much about Malawian music, but chances are you have heard it, or at least musicians influenced by it. African music in general first came to international attention in the 1950s with the popularity of ""kwela"" in the urban townships of Johannesburg. Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other    South Africa claims kwela for its own, but Kenny Gilmore, the director of a documentary that charts the history of Malawian music, says kwela was actually popularised in South Africa by Malawian musicians. ""The founding fathers of kwela kwela, a lot, not all of them, were Malawian, Malawi's never been that famous so nobody hears about them,"" he told the BBC World Service. ""Then they take a holiday down to South Africa, play some music, then, boom, the kwela kwela revolution [happens] and everybody thinks its South African."" Even a capella made famous by groups like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and more contemporary styles like Afro-jazz, both owe much of their distinct style to Malawian musicians according to Mr Gilmore. Malawi has nine tribal and linguistic groups, each possessing its own traditional dances and indigenous rhythms. ""True African music all comes from a traditional dance somewhere... and Malawi has got unique dances with unique rhythms,"" he says. He cites dances such as the Chewa's masked ""Gule Wamkulu"" (the big dance); the Ngoni's ""Ingoma"" war dance; the Beni military dance; and the healing ""Vimbuza"" spirit dance of the Tumbuka. But sadly only a handful of these were recorded in the 1940s and 1950s. Inspired by the late musical archivist Alan Lomax's famous journey to collect early blues recordings in the deep American South, for six weeks last year Mr Gilmore and his team travelled to villages across Malawi hoping to document and record some of this musical heritage, both past and present. He hoped to record as much as possible of what is left of these traditions before the memories and the music are gone forever. ""Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other. I went to Cape Town record shops, nothing, London, nothing, America, New York, nothing. These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms... we've got a unique musical melting pot    ""I'm on a mission to change it, I think the world needs to hear music and Malawi in the same sentence."" Using a portable studio, musicians from Malawi's most rural and remote areas were given the opportunity to record, promote and preserve their musical heritage. What the team got was a mix of individual musicians, small groups and cultural dance troupes, some of it purely traditional, some of it more of a fusion of traditional with contemporary and jazz influences. ""Sometimes you get these places in the world when you get these really interesting melting pots of cultures,"" says Mr Gilmore. ""You have the Congolese influence just above Malawi, you've got the Zambian influence to the west, you've got Zimbabwe to the east and you've got South Africa to the south. ""These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms - so all these great influences come into Malawi, mixing - we've got a unique musical melting pot."" Well-known Malawian musician and politician Lucius Banda says what makes Malawi music so special and deserving of greater interest is the way it has absorbed other influences into its musical traditions, making them their own. ""Malawi music is different, the special thing about Malawi music is [that it is] so cultural,"" he says. ""South Africa has disco and other Western influences. But Malawian music is quite unique in its own perspective."" One such influence which dramatically influenced the country's musical style was the banjo. The banjo was brought back to Malawi by soldiers who had served in East and Western African battalions during WWII. The banjo and blue grass influences were infused with traditional beats and dominated the country's music for nearly 20 years. In the 1970s jazz made an appearance in Malawi, then in more recent times has come gospel, reggae and pop influences. But what is most special about Malawi music according to Mr Gilmore is not the way it has fused the traditional with the contemporary - it is its energy and passion. ""I've played round the world and most of the times you get the beginning and it's warming up, people not getting too excited, then there's a kind of warm phase. ""In Malawi, from the first song boom, the whole club just kind of ignites in a fire bomb and it carries on until the last. ""The bartenders have left the bar, security have left the gate, someone's climbed over the fence you can see the whole nearby village dancing next to the gate, ""It's just a massive riotous party and it just leaves me filled with so much happiness.""

345,"A drug developed to treat leukaemia has been found to have surprising side effect - it appears able to restore colour to grey hair.  French doctors who treated 133 cancer patients with the drug Gleevec found that five men and four women who started out with grey hair ended up with their old colour back.  The doctors, led by Gabriel Etienne, of the Universite Victor Segalen in Bordeaux, published their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine.  They are keen to know whether other doctors have noticed the same effect.  One of the doctors said the effect may actually have been found in even more patients, but it was difficult to determine the true numbers as some of the patients had dyed their hair.  The process of color restoration usually took about five months, although in one patient the hair colour returned after 14 months of therapy.  One of the doctors, Francois-Xavier Mahon said people should not be taking the drug to restore hair colour.  But he said laboratory studies were under way to explore the surprising side effect.  Known in the UK as Glivec, the drug was launched in November 2001 as a treatment for a deadly form of cancer called chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).  The drug, which works by precisely targeting the molecules thought to cause the cancer, has produced highly promising results in clinical trials on over 7,500 patients world-wide.  It normalised the blood count in over 90% of patients, and reduced leukaemia cells in the bone marrow.  The drug has also produced promising results in treatment of a rare terminal intestinal cancer known as Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST)."
346,"A Chimeron queen called Delta, the last surviving member of her race, is being pursued by the evil Gavrok and his Bannermen, intent on a mission of genocide. Delta finds herself on board a space bus of tourists en route to Earth when it is knocked off course by an American satellite and ends up at a Welsh holiday camp in 1959.  The Doctor and Mel, having won a holiday with the tourists, help Delta to evade the rampaging Bannermen long enough to allow her child to hatch from its egg and grow to maturity. She, her daughter and a young man named Billy - who sacrifices his humanity to be with her - then escape to start a new life and ensure the continuation of the Chimeron race.  The Doctor and a young woman named Ray are held at gun point by an alien bounty hunter, Keillor, who has given away Delta's location to the Bannermen in return for a promised reward. The Doctor tells Keillor that he should let Ray go as she is of no use to him. He replies: 'I don't just kill for money. It's also something I enjoy.'  The Doctor confronts Gavrok and warns him that he will be brought to justice for his crimes. He demands the release of Mel and the holiday camp manager Burton, who have been held prisoner by the Bannermen, and starts to leave with them. The Bannermen prime their weapons for firing, and the Doctor worriedly speculates that he may have gone a little too far.  The American secret service agents Hawk and Weismuller are astonished as the TARDIS dematerialises. The mysterious beekeeper Goronwy glances up at the sky and gives a knowing smile and wink.  50s nostalgia films (American Graffiti, Peggy Sue Got Married, Back to the Future).  The Doctor : ""Many a slap 'twixt a cup and a lap.""  The Doctor : ""Love has never been known for its rationality.""  Burton : ""You are not the Happy Hearts Holiday Club from Bolton, but instead are spacemen in fear of an attack from some other spacemen?""  Goronwy is, the tone of this script suggests, just a wonderful and charming old man, open to the wonders of the universe. [However, he and the Doctor have enough instant rapport for the Doctor to hand him an alien baby without a second thought, as if the two of them are in the same business. Goronwy gives the Doctor a very secretive wink: perhaps he is a Time Lord.]  The Doctor's question mark umbrella makes its first appearance. There exists an authority who, if hearing about it, would punish the Bannermen for their genocide of the Chimerons [possibly the Time Lords].  The Navarinos are squat, wrinkly purple creatures who can shapechange and time travel. They have a high metabolic rate, and seem to have a lot in common with Time Lords. [Perhaps the Navarinos are one of the few races permitted to travel in time, since they're so peaceful. The toll money therefore goes to Gallifrey.] Chimeron males and infants are green, their females humanoid. They've been nearly wiped out by the Bannermen in some undisclosed conflict.  A toll point in the future [obviously near Navaro, and probably put on one of the Navarinos' main routes to tax their expeditions].  Mel's very scared of the Bannermen without being told who they are [She's met them before?].  Don Henderson, well known for his role as George Bulman in The XYY Man and its spin offs, and latterly for his co-starring role as Frank Kane in the BBC drama The Paradise Club, appears here as Gavrok.  There are guest appearances for a number of popular actors better known for their comedy and variety work, including Ken Dodd, Hugh Lloyd, Stubby Kaye and Richard Davies.  The scenes set in the Shangri-La holiday camp were filmed at Butlins in Barry Island, South Wales.  The Doctor's distinctive question-mark handle umbrella makes its first appearance.  Sylvester McCoy can be seen wearing his glasses - normally removed before recording - in some long shots of him riding a motor bike.  Keillor, the alien bounty hunter, is never referred to by name in the story's dialogue; his name is given only in the closing credits.  The rubber bodies on the ground during the initial battle.  The Doctor says the explosion of the sonic cone will destroy everyone, so why doesn't it?  Why isn't Billy poisoned by the alien food? (Why does it, instead, turn him into a Chimeron?)  Ray's bow makes her look like a Mouseketeer.  Vocalist - Tracey Wilson The vocalists are seen on screen only in Part One; they are heard in Parts Two and Three in the story's incidental music.  Vocalist - Jodie Wilson The vocalists are seen on screen only in Part One; they are heard in Parts Two and Three in the story's incidental music.  Title Music - Ron Grainer and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, arranged by Keff McCulloch  Confident, slick, and hugely enjoyable from beginning to end, Delta and the Bannermen isn't grim, gritty or cynical, and is thus tremendously adult. It roars with new style. This is the first real hint of McCoy's Doctor, dancing awkwardly with Ray, hugging a Stratocaster, confronting Gavrok and threatening the Bannermen. Langford is actually great in this, a very human story of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. Even Ken Dodd's OK. But who told Don Henderson to play it so straight?  Delta and the Bannermen is even more whimsical than the story that immediately preceded it, but in this case the scripts by Malcolm Kohll and the direction by Chris Clough are perfectly in tune with each other and the end result is much more successful. 'Even during the dark days of season twenty-three,' wrote Brian Willis in Muck and Devastation Issue Three, dated December 1987, 'if somebody had told me that the next season (if there ever was such a thing) would feature such luminaries as Ken Dodd, Stubby Kaye and Hugh Lloyd, I would have laughed in that somebody's face. And if that somebody had then gone on to suggest that I would actually enjoy a story featuring the said personalities, I would probably have screamed with mirth. The very idea... Actually, I rather liked Delta and the Bannermen.'  The story has a very 'fifties sci-fi' feel to it, recalling films of the I Married a Monster from Outer Space variety - an impression greatly enhanced by the setting of the main action in that very era and by more specific touches such as the use of period songs both in the performances of the holiday camp group, the Lorells, and in the incidental music score. The light-heartedness of the holiday camp atmosphere contrasts nicely with the grimness of the Bannermen's intentions and their genocidal hatred of the Chimerons.  'The whole thing had the air of a Hi-de-Hi! episode directed by James Cameron...,' continued Willis. '[The] script was not by any means a classic,... it had an air of unashamed absurdity and - dare I say it - silliness that made it, in parts, extremely memorable. The idea of a group of extraterrestrial rock and roll fans on a trip to Disneyland but having to land at Barry Butlins instead because their bus-shaped spaceship has hit a US satellite is one that could have come from Douglas Adams.'  The story boasts a good collection of supporting characters, the most intriguing of which is the beekeeper Goronwy, well played by Hugh Lloyd, who seems so unfazed by all the strange events going on around him that some commentators have been led to suggest that he might actually be an alien, or even perhaps a Time Lord living in 'retirement' on Earth.  The regulars also come over well in this story. Bonnie Langford seems much more comfortable than usual in the familiar holiday camp setting, and Sylvester McCoy is also by this point starting to settle into his role. 'For my money the seventh Doctor really came of age in this story,' wrote Mark Stammers in The Frame No. 5, dated February 1988. 'McCoy was in his element and so was his Doctor, and apart from a couple of duff lines I enjoyed his performance throughout. He was less manic than in the preceding tales; the misquotations were still there, but more in the background, as was the continual hat-doffing which had been so much a part of Paradise Towers.'  Delta and the Bannermen is another step in the right direction for the seventh Doctor and, all in all, a highly enjoyable romp."
347,"She is one of 80 Roma women in this pretty and quiet Czech town who claim they were coerced into sterilisation in the Czech health system.  Elegant and articulate, 37-year-old Elena describes how her stay in the maternity ward 16 years ago left her emotionally and physically scarred for life.  She had just delivered a boy and joked to the doctor: ""I won't bother to take the baby home, because I wanted a girl"".  The doctor's answer still reverberates in her ears: ""You'd better take it, because you will not have any more children. We have sterilised you.""  For years these women stayed silent, and some were even ashamed to tell their own husbands. Only a few years ago did the shocking details start to emerge.  Many were offered money, though that was not official policy. Similar cases have been reported in neighbouring Slovakia.  The practice officially ended in 1990 after the collapse of communist Czechoslovakia, but a number of doctors are said to have continued the operations on their own initiative.  The complaints sparked an official inquiry. The Czech ombudsman - Public Defender of Rights Otakar Motejl - investigated the cases and issued a report in December 2005.  ""The problem of sexual sterilisation carried out in the Czech Republic, either with improper motivation or illegally, exists,"" he said, recommending state compensation for women affected between 1973 and 1991.  During that period social services had offered some Roma women financial incentives to undergo sterilisation ""even though the state issued no instruction,"" he concluded.  The communist authorities had practised an assimilation policy towards Roma which ""included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the Romani community,"" he said.  But human rights groups say the last recorded case happened as late as 2003.  ""Sterilisation was used as a means of birth control,"" says Kumar Vishwanathan, head of Life Together, an Ostrava-based NGO for Roma rights.  Like many other Roma women, Elena Gorolova signed a consent form without realising what the operation entailed.  Some women say they had been administered drugs, others simply did not understand what the word ""sterilisation"" meant.  Czech doctors disagree. ""Sterilisation is conducted on purely medical grounds,"" says Richard Spousta, head of the gynaecological unit at an Ostrava hospital. ""We don't keep any statistics on Roma and non-Roma sterilised women. I don't know why you are making such claims.""  An investigation by a Czech health ministry advisory committee concluded that procedural mistakes had been made in a number of cases.  But the Czech embassy in London told the BBC that ""sterilisation is in no way a national policy targeted on a specific ethnic or any other group in the Czech Republic"".  ""We've suggested to the government that it issue an apology to the victims,"" says Ceslaw Walek, director of the Roma Community Affairs Council, which advises the government on Roma-related policies. ""But I cannot see this happening.""  Earlier this year the Czech high court did uphold a lower court's decision obliging an Ostrava hospital to apologise to one of the victims, Helena Ferencikova, sterilised in 2001.  ""This is the first decision of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe,"" says Lucie Fremlova from the Life Together NGO.  The hospital has not yet complied with the court's decision. Helena Ferencikova is still waiting."
348,"               German conglomerate Mannesmann and Vodafone AirTouch of Britain are to merge, creating the world's largest mobile telephones group. German conglomerate Mannesmann and Vodafone AirTouch of Britain are to merge, creating the world's largest mobile telephones group. The Mannesmann board agreed to the Vodafone offer after a seven-hour meeting in Dusseldorf, chairman Klaus Esser said at a press conference there. The deal is one of the world's largest-ever corporate takeovers. The deal is one of the world's largest-ever corporate takeovers. Mannesmann's management board recommends the offer but its 20-member supervisory board will meet to formally approve the deal on Friday. ""Mannesmann has reached an agreement with Vodafone AirTouch which creates a path to a single company. It is Mannesmann's assessment that this reflects the will of Mannesmann's shareholders,"" the company said in a statement.    Klaus Esser is to stay at the new company   ""We have agreed between us that Vodafone AirTouch will be making a revised proposal to Mannesmann shareholders,"" Mr Gent said. The announcement came four days before the close of Vodafone's hostile takeover bid for Mannesmann. Under the terms of the revised £112bn deal, Mannesmann shareholders are expected to get 49.5% of the merged company, with Vodafone providing 58.96 of its shares for each Mannesmann share. The revised deal values Mannesmann shares at 353 euros each. Vodafone's Chris Gent will head up the company, while, contrary to expectations, Klaus Esser will stay with the merged company. His new role will be deputy chairman. ""They are two strong businesses and together we can go from strength to strength,"" a Vodafone spokesman said late on Thursday. The new company will have joint headquarters in Dusseldorf and Britain. The merger creates a huge IT group under Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent, with some 42 million customers and interests ranging from the Americas and Australia through the UK, France, Germany and Italy.    Vodafone's Chris Gent will head the new company   Savings from combining the two companies are estimated to total at least £500m, with a minimal impact on jobs as the pair have few overlaps in their businesses. The new merged company offers a huge range of internet and mobile phone services. On Wednesday, Anglo-Dutch computer services firm CMG confirmed that it had agreed a deal with Vodafone to supply it with WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) technology for its mobile phones. This is the technical standard that allows mobile devices to be used for internet access. Other phone companies are expected to be urgently looking to secure alliances to compete with the threat posed by the Vodafone-Mannesmann deal. The UK, Germany and the European Commission would have to give regulatory clearance to the merger. This is likely to require the sale of mobile phone operator Orange, bought by Mannesmann last October. Otherwise a combined Vodafone and Orange would be seen as being too dominant in the UK market. The EC is expected to give an initial ruling on 17 February. A titanic struggle for control of Mannesmann has been raging since just before Christmas, when Vodafone made its ground-breaking original offer - the world's biggest hostile takeover bid. Last-minute talks between the two sides had been arranged as time ran out for manoeuvring before it would come down to shareholders to decide. Without an agreed deal, shareholders would have voted on Monday on whether to accept the takeover bid - and it was looking increasingly likely that they would have accepted Vodafone's hostile offer. The main sticking point has been share of ownership in the merged company. Mr Esser was understood to have given up his idea of Mannesmann shareholders owning 58.5% of the new company, but was still not prepared to see German control slip below the 50% mark. Mr Gent, on the other hand, was said to be adamant that his company's shareholders should own more than half of the combined group. On Thursday morning, shares in Mannesmann had risen 119% since October. There was a feeling that an agreed deal, even at such a late stage, could leave its shareholders with better terms than going for the hostile bid. Vodafone has said it decided to launch the attack on Mannesmann after the German company decided to buy Orange - a UK firm. According to Mr Gent, this deal - which was seen as a defensive move by Mannesmann - contravened a gentleman's agreement not to compete on each other's territory."

All the men were found guilty of forming an armed gang, and nine were convicted of planning to bomb the British consulate, an Anglican church and a Swiss-owned hotel in Yemen.  He said the men had ""associated to form an armed gang intending to carry out murderous acts of sabotage and terrorism"".

""This is a victory of evil against justice,"" he said. ""These boys are innocent"".  Under Yemeni justice, the men have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal and then on to the Supreme Court.  The prosecution claims that the London-based Muslim fundamentalist Abu Hamza sent the men to Yemen to carry out terrorist attacks. Hamza is the father of Kamel and step-father of Ghalain.  The prosecution also claims that the defendants had trained in a military camp run by Islamic militant Zein Al-Abidine al-Mihdar.  In May, he was sentenced to death for his part in the kidnapping - four days after the men were arrested - of 16 Western tourists.  Four of the tourists, three Britons and one Australian, were shot dead during a gun battle between the kidnappers and the Yemeni authorities."
350,"Sebastian Vettel made light work of poor visibility at a rain-hit Chinese Grand Prix with a superb drive to give Red Bull their first ever race victory. Team-mate Mark Webber made it a one-two to ensure it was a dream day for the British-based team in Shanghai. Championship leader Jenson Button came third ahead of the second Brawn car of veteran driver Rubens Barrichello. World champion Lewis Hamilton was sixth for rapidly-improving McLaren behind Finnish team-mate Heikki Kovalainen. After two days of hot and sunny conditions for practice and qualifying, strong winds brought a continuous rain to the modern track meaning the Chinese GP started as the Malaysian race had finished - under the safety car. It was crazy out there, there was so much aquaplaning    That appeared to open up the field and play into the hands of Brawn GP, the championship pace-setters who were sat in fourth and fifth on the grid and carrying a heavier fuel load than the Red Bulls ahead of them and, in particular, Renault's Fernando Alonso in second. But Brawn's drivers could do nothing about the consistent pace of the Red Bulls in the soaking conditions, with Vettel particularly impressive on his way to his second GP victory after becoming the youngest ever race winner in Italy last year with Toro Rosso. The race started with eight laps under the safety car, though when it peeled off the cars were still engulfed in spray. But Vettel drove flawlessly throughout, eventually beating Webber by 10.9 seconds as he occasionally clocked laps that were three seconds quicker than anybody else - and the 21-year-old German now moves up to third in the drivers' championship. Australian Webber could himself have notched his first GP win but will have to settle for his best ever finish as the pole sitter took victory for the third successive race this season. Around 30 laps in he and Button became embroiled in a battle for second position and both drivers made small but costly errors, causing them to momentarily skid off the sheets of water which stood on the sodden track. That period proved crucial for Vettel who, with Button and Webber trading places but slightly losing time, kept his cool to stretch out his lead and make sure of the win. ""I am extremely happy, this is the second time now [I have won] in the wet,"" he said. ""The car was fantastic, the team did a really good job in fixing the problems we had and preparing it. ""It was the right decision to start behind the safety car."" Button stretched his lead at the top of the championship by a point as a result of finishing third and highlighted the difficulties drivers faced in the treacherous conditions in Shanghai. ""It was crazy out there, there was so much aquaplaning,"" he said. ""Every lap I thought I was going to run the car off, especially on the last corner."" Sixth-placed Hamilton secured three points after experiencing an improved showing in a McLaren car which is showing far greater reliability than in the first two Grands Prix of the season. Starting in eighth, the English driver made an impressive early charge after the safety car went in and moved up to fourth position around the 25-lap mark. The world champion's determination to challenge the frontrunners in a season in which he has largely been well off the pace, allied to the wet circuit, saw him spin off a number of times - but Hamilton expressed a quiet pleasure with the progress McLaren are making. Brawn is clearly the quickest in the dry but Newey has designed another great chassis which is in a class of its own in the wet...    ""It was terrible [conditions] out there,"" he said. ""There was a little bit of fun at the beginning when I had some grip but it was really tough. I'm sure it was the same for everyone. ""[But] the reliability of the car is fantastic and these were some good points for the team."" One of the most notable performances of the race came from Sebastian Buemi - the only rookie driver this season - who drove aggressively and, after briefly sitting fourth at one stage and then recovering from a minor crash into the back of Vettel, eventually finished eight to notch a point for Toro Rosso. Reigning constructors' champions Ferrari had another disastrous race and it is the first time since 1981 they have gone three races into the season without a point. Whilst going well in third position on lap 21, Felipe Massa's car gradually slowed down before coming to a halt as it broke down on the track, causing the Brazilian to retire. ""I'm very disappointed and a bit upset but my motivation is still intact,"" said Massa. ""All of us must work together to get out of this situation. The team is united and there is a real will to turn things round as soon as possible."" Team-mate Kimi Raikkonen did enjoy a brief battle with Hamilton around the same period as he looked to secure the Italian team's first points of 2009, but the Finn eventually finished 10th. Force India came close to securing their first ever points in F1 but Adrian Sutil, who was in sixth place with five laps to go, spun off on worn tyres. After the race both Red Bull drivers gave credit to the team's crew, who had to fix a driveshaft problem that had blighted the race cars in Saturday practice and restricting their running in qualifying. They will now be looking to build on their first win in the next race in Bahrain on Sunday, 26 April.     "
351,"The former members of Lostprophets have started a new band following the conviction of frontman Ian Watkins on child sex charges last year.  Stuart Richardson, Lee Gaze, Luke Johnson, Mike Lewis and Jamie Oliver are working with former Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly.  Speaking to Radio Cardiff, Rickly said that Watkins' former bandmates deserved ""a second chance"".  He has compared No Devotion's music to The Cure and New Order.  Geoff Rickley, a US songwriter and producer, is best known for being the former lead singer of Thursday.  The 35-year-old released six studio albums with the band and has released one with his current group United Nations with a second due in 2014.  Speaking about Watkins' sexual abuse prison sentence and how it affected the other Lostprophets members, Rickly said: ""I think if ever there was a group of people that needed a second chance, it's those guys and they're going to take full advantage of it.  ""People don't really think of what happens to the other members. That took away their life.""  Rickly confirmed that he was working with the band through his label, Collect Records.  ""It's been my honour to work with them on their new band from a label perspective,"" he added.  ""People are not going to know what hit them when the new band comes out.  ""It's like everything I grew up on; a little bit of New Order, a little bit of Joy Division, little bit of The Cure. It's just so forward-thinking.""  Ian Watkins was sentenced to 35 years in prison at the end of last year for a string of child sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby.  He was given a 29-year jail sentence and will spend a further six years on licence.  Watkins, 36, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to 13 child sex offences.  His two co-defendants, who are the mothers of children he abused, were jailed for 14 and 17 years.  Earlier this year it was reported that he was seeking leave to appeal against the length of his jail term.  Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube"
352,"Mother Teresa - a special calling to help the poorest Tributes have been pouring in for Mother Teresa, whose death after a heart attack was announced in India on Friday. The Vatican in Rome said Pope John Paul II was quickly informed of Mother Teresa's death, and immediately prayed for her. A Vatican spokesman said her death had touched the Pope's heart very deeply. Francis Sejerstad, the Norwegian chairman of the Nobel Committee which awarded the 1979 Peace Prize to Mother Teresa, said she had been a choice that the committee looked back on with pride. Humanitarian work, he said, had always been one of the most important criteria, and Mother Teresa had been an outstanding example of how this can be done in a self-sacrificing way. The head of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, Cardinal Basil Hume, said Mother Teresa had been a unique example of genuine holiness. Ordinary people around the world, he said, had been inspired by her unshakeable trust in God, her absolute commitment to the poor, and the strength of her love and humanity. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that in a week already filled with tragedy, the world would be saddened that one of its most compassionate servants had died. Mother Teresa's spirit, he said, will live on as an inspiration to all of us. President Clinton - who is currently on holiday in the north-eastern US state of Massachusetts - described her as an incredible person. In India itself, crowds grew outside Mother Teresa's mission -- known as the Mother House, as more and more of the poor of Calcutta came to know of the death of the nun who did so much for them. They gathered outside the house to say the last farewell to the Saint of the Gutters, as she became widely known after she relinquished more conventional forms of missionary work in the 1940s and founded her own order, the Missionaries of Charity. Mother Teresa: a special calling to help the poorest Inside the Mother House, sisters of the order, whose hallmark is a simple blue-edged white sari, said mass amid scenes of profound emotion. Mother Teresa had become increasingly frail in recent years, though she surprised everyone by undertaking a trip to Europe and the United States only three months ago, providing her with what has now turned out to be a last chance to meet the Pope. Her death came swiftly, shortly after she had complained of chest pains and doctors had been summoned urgently to the mother house. The Indian Prime Minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, led the tributes to Mother Teresa and her work within India by calling her an apostle of peace and love. Though she was born of Albanian parents, India's President, K R Narayanan, described her as particularly Indian in the true spirit of the country's culture. Such a one as her, he said, rarely walked upon the earth. When she was 18 she joined a community of Irish nuns and went to their mission in Calcutta in 1929. Just over twenty years later she founded the Missionaries of Charity -- which over the succeeding years established hundreds of orphanages, homes for the poor and other charity centres around the world. Mother Teresa was not without her critics. Some doctors accused her of providing haphazard medical care and not using basic medicines, like painkillers. Writing in the leading medical journal The Lancet in 1994, Dr Robin Fox commented: ""Mother Teresa prefers providence to planning"". In the same year, a British documentary - controversially entitled ""Hell's Angel"" - charged that she urged the poor to accept their fate, portraying the rich as favoured by God. Journalist Christopher Hitchens, who wrote the script, remarked: ""She lends spiritual solace to dictators and to wealthy exploiters...and preaches surrender and prostration to the poor."" In 1979 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, one of many honours bestowed on her. She said simply that she had a special calling to help the poorest of the poor."
353,"Flintoff has not played Test cricket since January 2007 England legend Sir Ian Botham says Andrew Flintoff should not be rushed back into the national side. The squad for next Thursday's first Test against New Zealand is named on Sunday and the 30-year-old all-rounder has been tipped to return to the fold. Flintoff has bowled well after a fourth ankle operation last October but Botham has warned against a speedy comeback. ""I would just hold Fred back a bit. I'd like him to play a bit more county cricket,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I'd like him to have plenty of overs under his belt and plenty of runs as a batsman come the South Africans (later in the summer), because I think that will be a much sterner test. ""I'd just like him to be given that time to get his confidence back; full confidence in his body and more importantly in that ankle. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""England do need him but they need a fit Fred. ""But he also knows this is really make-or-break time because he's 30 years old and he's had four operations on it, so it's got to be right."" Flintoff has not played a Test match since the Ashes whitewash in Australia in January 2007. He has struggled with the bat on his return to action this season - a pair in his latest game for Lancashire against Durham means he has managed only 68 runs in seven competitive innings. But the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have denied reports former England opener Geoffrey Boycott will be brought into the senior coaching set-up to help Flintoff with his batting. Flintoff is a known admirer of the Yorkshire legend and has called on Boycott's expertise in the past. He is the type of batsman where it can just click with one shot    But the ECB said any extension of that relationship would be in an unofficial capacity, and that informal talks with Boycott, 67, had actually been held with a view to him helping younger age groups. ""We use Nasser Hussain to talk to age-group teams and that is what we envisage other former players doing,"" said a spokesman. While Flintoff is struggling with the bat, England team-mate Paul Collingwood believes the Lancastrian, who dismissed him on Thursday in the current County Championship match with Durham, is ""back to his best"" with the ball. ""He has run in really hard this week and it has been impressive stuff,"" Collingwood told BBC Radio 5 Live. Who should England select for the first Test against New Zealand? ""He has bowled around 90mph, got it to shape away a touch and, as Fred always does, bowled in areas that are very difficult to defend against, let alone score off. ""I am not a selector but from what I have seen this week he is pretty much back to his best with the ball. Whether he has enough overs under his belt I don't know, you'd have to ask Fred. ""We have to be very careful because he has had a few operations on his ankle and we don't want to rush him back too soon. ""But the last few days has been hairy stuff and he has produced some exceptional bowling. ""I am sure he is a bit concerned about his batting and would love to have scored a lot more runs. ""But he is the type of batsman where it can just click with one shot. He is destructive on his day and it could be one ball that comes out the middle of the bat, and it just clicks again."" • Sir Ian Botham has announced plans for a 12th charity walk on behalf of Leukaemia Research. It will start in Taunton on 10 October and take in nine towns before finishing in Durham eight days later.     "
354,"Curries are now a regular part of life in the North West. Rusholme's curry mile in Manchester has offered a diverse range of foods from the Asian subcontinent since the 1960s. But did you know that curries were eaten in the North West as early as the 18th century? Inside Out went to John Rylands library in Manchester and tracked down recipes dating back to 1769, written by the house keeper at Arley Hall in Cheshire. Tony Morris researches the history of the nation's favourite dish The first curry houses in the North West were cafes, set up for the men who had come to the region from the Asian subcontinent in the 1950s to work in the textile mills. The Tandoori Kitchen was one of the first curry restaurants to open on Rusholme's famous Curry mile on Manchester's Wilmslow Rd. The Hussain family opened the business 35 years ago, originally serving Persian food to immigrant workers. In recent years there's been a revolution in curry eating. The image of men behaving badly, gulping downing super-hot curries with several pints of lager, are long gone. Today, a trip out for a curry is a posh affair, with some of the country's top chefs cooking up sophisticated dishes of complexity and variety. A far cry from a Saturday night curry from a foil container! The Shere Khan opened its first restaurant on Wilmslow Road in Manchester 16 years ago. Chief executive Nighat Awan says she wanted the restaurant to be bright and modern, away from the ""flock wallpaper"" image that other restaurants had at the time. Her empire has now grown to include restaurants and takeaways across the North West, and a Shere Khan range of food products which are exported across the world. So what are the Shere Khan's top tips for making that perfect curry? One of the hardest things to get right for the amateur cook is the 'spice factor'. If your sauce is too hot, try cooling it down with a touch of yoghurt. On the other hand, if it isn't spicey enough, simply add some chopped green chillies. Better still, try out the Shere Khan's very own special recipe for chicken balti. 1 knob of butter or tablespoon of vegetable oil Add peppers and fry with chicken for three to four minutes. Garnish with coriander and serve with basmati rice and naan bread."
355,"BBC News has thousands of journalists, a multi-million pound budget and hundreds of millions of users worldwide. So just how does news chief Helen Boaden manage it all? Simple, she just thinks of the audiences.  Audiences are at the heart of BBC News which strives to report what matters in the UK and around the world with independence and impartiality.  BBC News aims to provide access to the information and ideas everyone needs to make sense of an increasingly complex world, providing background and context to the news.  Through its emphasis on specialist knowledge, international newsgathering, and its breadth of programmes, BBC News seeks to deliver a complete news package, covering arts, science, sport, politics, business and world affairs.  What falls under the BBC News banner?  BBC News gathers and produces national daily news, business, political and current affairs programmes on BBC television and radio.  It is also responsible for the continuous news channels BBC News 24, BBC Parliament, BBC World, interactive services, Ceefax and the BBC News website.  BBC Radio News produces between two and three hours of programming for every hour of the day. It is broadcast across seven UK radio networks and around the globe on the BBC World Service.  Radio News also produces material for BBC Scotland, BBC Wales and BBC Northern Ireland and for BBC local radio. Programmes made by Radio News include Today, The World at One, PM, The World Tonight, Broadcasting House and The World This Weekend.  How big is the BBC News budget - is it justified?  BBC News has an annual budget of £350 million (2004/05).  BBC News is highly respected both in the UK and around the world, from the World Service which reaches a global audience of more than 150 million listeners with hundreds of bulletins in more than 40 languages every day, to the BBC's flagship television news programme The Ten O'Clock news programme on BBC One.  The breadth and depth of BBC news coverage is unrivalled, with subject specialists who can throw a spotlight on people and stories which are not widely known.  There is no universal news agenda that applies to all. That is why we broadcast in many different styles and via many different media.  The BBC's news service is trusted and respected and represents excellent value for money.  The bulk of programming comes from the news centre in Television Centre, west London - the largest such operation in the world.  Political programming, including the BBC Parliament channel, is based in the heart of Westminster at Millbank while international radio programming comes from the home of World Service - Bush House in central London.  The current staff total is 3,500. We also have staff across the UK, and in key news bureaux around the world to provide viewers with a breadth and depth of information about a wider world.  How many people do we employ in the UK and worldwide and in how many bureaux?  BBC News is the largest broadcast news operation in the world with more than 2,000 journalists and 44 newsgathering bureaux, 41 of which are overseas.  To what extent do we ""compete"" with Sky News and ITN and, globally, CNN across our platforms?  BBC News 24 was launched to be the best UK television news channel. We compete to be the best, with our emphasis being first-hand coverage of the latest breaking news with a commitment to depth, context and intelligent analysis.  We always welcome the competition that plurality brings; greater choice for the viewer is a positive move.  BBC News does not produce the BBC's UK regional news programmes and service but works very closely with BBC Nations and Regions across all media to ensure that we reflect the diverse picture of life in communities throughout the UK.  Do you think BBC News has a good relationship with its audiences?  Audiences are at the heart of what we do.  The BBC sees its audience as citizens who have a right to independent and impartial information, and we gauge their feedback whenever we can.  Recent opinion polls have suggested that audiences have not lost trust in BBC News following the events of last summer; in latest research, 78% of respondents said that they continued to view the Corporation in the same way they had prior to the Hutton report.  Has the BBC achieved ""closure"" regarding the Hutton Report?  One can't contest the impact the Report had on the BBC, but we have learnt from the experience and moved on.  Are we meeting the recommendations of the Neil Report, such as impartiality, truth, accuracy and diversity of opinion?  The BBC News mantra has always been one of truth, impartiality, accuracy and diversity of opinion.  The BBC has always recognised the fundamental need for independent journalism to support a healthy democracy, and sought to be a trusted guide in an information age.  Accommodating a range of views is a must for democratic debate, and BBC News has always endeavoured to offer a platform for such voices.  As the Head of News, who are you accountable to?  The Director of News reports to the Director General, Mark Thompson, and the Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, but all in the BBC are accountable to the most important 'stake holders' - the licence fee payers.  What next for BBC News? Are we prepared for the nature of news demand from our audiences across ever-changing platforms?  Audiences are consuming news coverage in increasingly different ways, it is our job to keep up with the demand.  BBC news has always embraced the potential of new technology, as highlighted with a recent broadcast report via a mobile phone."
356,"Eight police officers have been injured and 58 people arrested in the worst outbreak of violence yet outside the News International printing plant in Wapping, east London.  One officer, a 27-year-old sergeant, was taken to hospital with head injuries.  Police estimated 5,000 demonstrators gathered near the printing works for a mass demonstration.  Similar mass protests have taken place regularly outside the Wapping plant ever since the start of a strike three weeks ago over new working conditions and the move from Fleet Street to cheaper premises in East London.  News International publishes some of Britain's best known newspapers - the Times, the Sunday Times, the Sun, and the News of the World.  Its owner, Australian press baron Rupert Murdoch, has been heavily criticised for his handling of the dispute.  He summarily dismissed the thousands of staff members who downed tools on 24 January, and brought in members of the maverick electricians union, the EETPU, to keep the printers running.  Ever since, the strike has become an increasingly violent and bitter battle between the printers, the police and Mr Murdoch.  For the first time since picketing began, police used riot shields during today's fighting, and mounted police were brought in to break up sections of the crowd.  Wyn Jones, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said, ""We saw the classic example of honest well-intentioned union members supporting their cause being joined by diverse elements whose only interest was in causing as much trouble as possible.  ""They were intent on disrupting business and assaulting officers.""  Police barricades have been put up at entrances to the Wapping site, and traffic has been stopped from getting through apart from vans carrying copies of newspapers.  Michael Hicks, an official for the main union involved in the strike, Sogat '82, said today's turnout had been ""magnificent"", but added, ""Unfortunately we had a handful of people who joined this march who did not carry out the instructions of the print workers' stewards.""  The general secretary of Sogat '82, Brenda Dean, also condemned the violence.  She said, ""If fringe people were responsible for violence, that is not helping our case. We would appeal to everyone to have peaceful picketing and demonstrating at Wapping."""
357,"Alastair Cook scored his first Test century since December 2007    Alastair Cook hit a career-best 139 for his eighth Test century as England batted out day five to draw the fourth Test against West Indies in Barbados. The tourists resumed on 6-0, 143 runs adrift, and the captains eventually shook hands after tea as England declared on 279-2, 130 runs ahead. England lost Andrew Strauss for 38 and Owais Shah for 21 before Cook hit his first Test century since December 2007. West Indies will go into the match in Trinidad knowing that they cannot be beaten in a series against England for the first time since 1998. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Having made 600-6 declared in the first innings, England will be disappointed that they were not in a position to push for the win going into the final day at Kensington Oval. But after the hosts declared on 749-9 in reply, Strauss' men can take credit for securing the draw so comfortably. With England's batting collapse on day four of the first Test still relatively fresh in the memory, West Indies knew victory was by no means beyond them if they could apply pressure on the tourists from the outset. Will the detractors who claim Cook should be dropped for getting out in the 50-60s be satisfied now he has got his century?    Their task was made more difficult by a flat pitch on which 1,355 runs had been scored at the start of play and that was showing few signs of deterioration despite the odd crack. But the hosts began in determined fashion and might have emerged with the wicket of Cook when the batsman was beaten outside his off stump on three occasions in the first over by Fidel Edwards. It was vital for England that openers Strauss and Cook weathered the early storm and they did so in cautious fashion amid some testing and disciplined fast bowling from Edwards and Daren Powell. The pair gradually grew in confidence, though, and went some way to calming any nerves as Strauss crashed Powell past point for four and Cook worked Edwards through the off side to the same effect. Having seen Cook struggle to cope with short-pitched deliveries in the first innings - he eventually fell on 97 with the last of several miscued hook shots - Edwards targeted the Essex left-hander with more of the same. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Cook issued a mixed response, offering a few poorly timed slaps before emphatically pulling Powell and Edwards to the rope. Strauss was making fairly serene progress but almost lost his partner when Cook's miscued slog-sweep off Sulieman Benn narrowly eluded Brendan Nash, who was running back from deep mid-wicket with the ball coming over his shoulder. Cook was also the beneficiary of poor West Indian field placing when a Benn delivery clipped his glove and looped into the air, only for the leg slip to be positioned too deep. Cook converted a fifty for only the eighth time in 28 attempts Keen to inject some much-needed life into the session, Windies captain Chris Gayle brought himself into the attack and the decision paid dividends. He almost had Cook run out by Benn before Strauss tried to cut a quicker delivery that was drifted into him but succeeded only in chopping the ball into his stumps. Shah was quickly into his stride with a blistering drive off Benn through cover, while Cook passed 50 for the 20th time by cutting Benn to the rope and helped the tourists to 115-1, a 34-run deficit, at lunch. But any thoughts England may have harboured of a comfortable start to the afternoon session were dashed when Shah, struck plumb on the toe, fell lbw to Benn in the sixth over after the restart. By that point Gayle had already sent down a devilish maiden to Cook that culminated with third umpire Daryl Harper rejecting a TV referral after Ryan Hinds took what West Indies felt was a catch off the bat. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Cook was having problems coping with Gayle and Benn but, fortunately for England, Pietersen was on hand to steady the innings and get the scoreboard ticking over again. That, in turn, seemed to relax Cook and after England overhauled West Indies' first innings total, he opened up with a flurry of well-timed boundaries off Edwards and part-time spinner Hinds. He crafted his way to 99, becoming the youngest Englishman to reach 3,000 runs in the process, but remained there for 10 nervy deliveries before passing 100 by working Hinds into the leg side for three. Cook was entitled to celebrate - his last hundred came against Sri Lanka in Galle on 18 December 2007 - but he would have been returning to the pavilion on 105 had Devon Smith held on at slip after Hinds coaxed an outside edge. Pietersen clubbed Hinds over long-on for a towering six and swept a single to bring up his fifty as England reached tea on 233-2, an 84-run lead. In a tame evening session, Cook passed the 127 he made against Pakistan in 2006 but just 46 runs were added in 13 overs before a draw was agreed.     "

360,"England batsman Owais Shah has agreed to play for the Wellington Firebirds in New Zealand's domestic Twenty20 cricket competition in December.  In 17 Twenty20 internationals for England, the 30-year-old Middlesex batsman has scored 347 runs at an average of 24.78.  Ex-New Zealand and Wellington captain Stephen Fleming, who played with Shah at Middlesex, recommended the batsman.  Fleming said: ""He's one of the world's better international Twenty20 batsmen.""  Pakistan-born Shah is part of England's squad for the Twenty20 and one-day international series against Australia as well as the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa in September and October.  ""A key goal for the Firebirds the summer is to win the domestic T20 competition,"" said Wellington head coach Anthony Stuart.  ""There is now the added carrot of a spot in the lucrative Champions League tournament in India.""  Shah is the second top international player to join a New Zealand side for the 2009/10 domestic Twenty20 series after Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan signed a short-term deal with Northern Districts.  Last season, England one-day all-rounder Dimitri Mascarenhas helped Otago to the domestic Twenty20 title which qualified them for the forthcoming Champions League.  Earlier this year Shah, who has twice toured New Zealand with England in 2002 and 2008, was signed by Delhi for the second series of the Indian Premier League, but did not play in any games.

See if you agree with what he says: ""Prone to argue with the chairman, slightly vulnerable, perspires a lot, a favourite with the crowd - people hiss when I'm cruel to him,"" said Humph.    Tim: Yes, I think none of that's true except the bit about my perspiring a lot. I do do that, I have to say. Yes, I'll accept that. I'm very pleased with that. Move on..    Barry, Humph describes you thus: ""The gag man. There are no embarrassing silences thanks to you...    Barry: Embarrassing noises but not silences.  Inteviewer: ...bottomless pit of one-liners, able to come up with gags at a second's notice, provides the bricks and mortar.""  Barry: And they let me appear in it sometimes as well. I bring my wheelbarrow. It's very gracious of him though, particularly about my quick wit.  Tim: Anyway, what would he know?    Graeme, you're described thus: ""Bides his time, picks his moment, a punchline man supreme, very dry, often has the perfect punchline which helps me (Humph) end the show on a high note.    Tim: Very dry as opposed to the very sweaty me, is that what he's saying?   Barry: Was that Humph who said that?  Interviewer: Yes.  Barry: I detect a very Graeme style in that.  Graeme: I put a stop to the fun basically is what he's saying.  Tim: Yes, but you bide your time about it.    Humph's very modest about his own comic abilities. What do you think his particular gifts are?    Barry: He's very arrogant, overbearing and quite ruthless.  Tim: I've been a fan of his since I was a teenager. I used to go listen to his band which still plays magnificently today. And I still get a thrill out of working with Humph. It's extraordinary, after all these years. He's such an incredibly nice and bright man and he is modest, but he shouldn't be. I think he's quite fantastic.  Barry: I still think 'It's him, it's him!'.    How much of his stuff is written and how much is ad-libbed?    Tim: Well, he is capable of writing everything but Iain Pattinson actually writes his script now. I think Iain would say that the great thing is you're writing for a great man. There's nothing worse for a writer than to write something that is delivered badly. Iain writes some good stuff and Humph makes it even better which is perfect for a writer.  Graeme: And, obviously, the nature of the show is not all scripted. Humph reads his links then we play the games and Humph says injections of his own and very often they're show-stoppers as well. He's an extremely funny man. I don't think he knows how funny he is or how he is funny which is probably a good thing - he just does it.  Barry: He's in a great tradition like Kenneth Horne was in Round the Horne - the obeying man in the middle with all the idiots milling about and he's never quite sure what's going on but he just wants to get it over.  Tim: And the seeming innocence allows him to be absolutely filthy. ""Humph can't have said that, can he?"" And, of course, everything he says is double entendre anyway and he looks really, genuinely surprised if the audience laughs. As Graeme says, he can ad-lib as well. I remember something he said during our recording on Sunday. He said something like ""Your hand writing is so bad, I have to pin it up and run past it to read it."" I don't quite know what it means but it made me laugh enormously.         Back to Interviews...     "
363,"Around 1,200 people are thought to have attended the wedding of Emmanuele Filiberto and Clotilde Courau.  The bride, who is six months pregnant, was initially viewed with disaste by Filiberto's father, Vittorio Emmanuel, because of her left-wing views.  The event has been given extensive media coverage and was shown live on Sky TV. It has been dubbed the ""wedding of the year"".  Courau sported a Valentino dress, a veil held in place by a diamond tiara and gems belonging to the House of Savoy.  She held a tumbling bouquet of pink roses as she walked down the aisle with her father.  Both were moved to tears on several occasions.  Prince Albert of Monaco, who introduced the couple three years ago, was the best man.  Celebrities such as French rock singer Jonny Hallyday and fashion designer Pierre Cardin were in attendance, as were a number of Italian aristocrats.  The basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels, built on the ruins of the Diocletian baths, is where Filiberto's great grandfather King Victor Emmanuel III married Helen of Montenegro in 1896.  The 31-year-old banker has said media reports that his fiancee was an ""anarcho-communist"" were speculation.  Courau has said she will continue to work as an actress.  ""I will work under my name and I will be Clotilde of Savoy to advance humanitarian causes,"" she told the newspaper Corriere della Sera on Thursday.  Both have stressed that they married for love.  ""Our love is strong, it will carry us far,"" Courau told the newspaper.  They also say they do not want to be treated as royalty.  A constitutional ban which kept the male Savoy heirs out of Italy for more than half a century was lifted late last year at the same time as the family condemned Mussolini's race laws.  The last Savoy monarch approved the laws which marked the start of the persecution and deportation of Italian Jews during World War II."
364,"England suffered penalty agony once more as Italy won a shoot-out after the Euro 2012 quarter-final finished goalless in Kiev.  Italy were vastly superior to England over the course of 120 minutes - but the resilience and organisation that have swiftly become the trademark under new manager Roy Hodgson took an enthralling game to penalties.  And, as on five of the previous six occasions England have entered this sudden-death environment, they were left heartbroken, with Italy confirming a semi-final meeting with Germany in Warsaw on Thursday.  England captain Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney were successful from the spot, but Ashley Young struck the bar and Ashley Cole's effort was saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Buffon.  ""Italy were far superior to England. What impressed me was technically they controlled the game, but also they were physically stronger. That surprised me, and they deserved to get into the semis where they will expect a good clash with Germany. I had hopes for England but to be honest they didn't deserve it because they could not keep tempo with Italy, they didn't close down spaces and it was too big a mountain to climb.""  Mario Balotelli scored Italy's first spot-kick but Riccardo Montolivo's miss gave England hope that was cruelly snatched away as Andrea Pirlo audaciously chipped in his spot-kick and Antonio Nocerino coolly slotted home before former West Ham midfielder Alessandro Diamanti scored the decisive penalty.  England cannot complain that the better team did not emerge as winners - but even in the face of a constant wave of Italian attacks Hodgson's men still showed enough heart and durability to make their Euro 2012 exit with pride.  As Italy subjected them to what was almost torture by possession, England's back four and goalkeeper Joe Hart responded magnificently by erecting a wall of defiance, with John Terry outstanding.  England will head for home on Monday after a campaign they can reflect on with a measure of satisfaction despite the disappointment. Hodgson - at short notice - marshalled his forces effectively but the gulf in class with Italy was clear and his team looked jaded long before the end.  Hodgson will now take stock of events in Ukraine, where England drew with France and won against Sweden and Ukraine to top Group D, as he plots the qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.  Hodgson picked England's first unchanged team since the miserable last-16 encounter with Germany at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa - a show of faith in the side that beat Ukraine in Donetsk.  England were almost given the worst possible start when, after a prolonged period of possession, De Rossi's swerving left-foot volley hit the post with Hart stretching in vain to make contact.  If this was an ominous start for England, they responded with an opportunity of their own when Glen Johnson found space in the area but could not get sufficient power in his shot and Buffon was able to claw the ball away.  England's opening spell had been their best of Euro 2012. It was almost capped with a goal in the 13th minute when the dangerous Johnson crossed for Rooney but he could only glance a header over the top.  Balotelli had been his usual combination of threat mixed with moments of infuriating slackness. He was slow to react to the peerless Pirlo's pass and allowed Terry to make a fine recovering tackle, then forced his Manchester City team-mate Hart into a save from a low effort.  England had lost the measure of control they had exerted for a spell, but there was still much to encourage Hodgson, particularly when Rooney opened up Italy's defence and Danny Welbeck should have done better than sidefoot wide from the edge of the area.  Balotelli was again involved as he closed in on Antonio Cassano's header six yards out but was left hacking at the post in frustration as Terry and Joleon Lescott combined to clear.  Italy continued to control possession after the break and England were fortunate to survive a chaotic incident in which Hart saved from De Rossi and Balotelli before Montolivo diverted the rebound over the bar.  Hodgson knew he needed to shift the momentum away from Italy and he chose to try to do it with a double substitution on the hour, replacing Welbeck and James Milner with Andy Carroll and Theo Walcott.  Both were involved as England managed to unsettle Italy, only for Young's close-range effort to be deflected following muscular work from Carroll.  Italy coach Cesare Prandelli introduced Diamanti in an attempt to pierce England's stubborn resistance and he swiftly forced Hart into a smart save.  The game continued to absorb into the closing seconds of normal time as Johnson produced a crucial block to stop Italian substitute Nocerino, while Rooney almost stole the win for England with an overhead kick at the other end.  England made a quick change in extra time as Jordan Henderson replaced Scott Parker but Italy still held the initiative, with Diamanti's attempted cross bouncing of the upright to safety.  Nocerino then had the ball in the net with a header as penalties loomed, but it was rightly ruled out for offside.  So it went to penalties - and a familiar tale of woe as England were again the victims of this cruellest form of defeat.

Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean have been crowned the Olympic ice skating champions after scooping gold in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. More than 24 million people watched the British couple score maximum points at the Zetra Stadium for their slow, sensuous free dance performance of Ravel's Bolero. It was an overwhelming St Valentine's Day victory for the duo in an event traditionally dominated by Soviet skaters. The couple from Nottingham received a standing ovation from the 8,500 spectators in the arena and flowers rained onto the ice after they completed their stirring four-minute performance. They scored 12 out of 18 possible sixes for their free dance and the maximum possible of nine sixes for artistic impression. I think it was the most emotional performance we have ever given. What just happened out there - getting the medals - that is what we've worked for so hard for so long   Torvill smiled as the gold medal was hung around her neck and Dean had to fight back tears as he stood on the Olympic podium to receive his award. ""Tonight we reached the pinnacle. I don't remember the performance at all. It just happened,"" Dean said. ""But I think it was the most emotional performance we have ever given. What just happened out there - getting the medals - that is what we've worked for so hard for so long."" Torvill added: ""I just don't believe it. I don't think we'll get to bed tonight at all. I just want to say hello and thank the people of Nottingham."" Natalya Bestemianova and Andrei Bukin, from the Soviet Union took the silver medal while the American skaters Judy Blumberg and Michael Seibert picked up the bronze. Princess Anne, who has been in the front row for all their Olympic performances, congratulated the pair on their victory. The Queen also sent a telegramme commending the British couple on their outstanding achievement. Throughout the Olympics they have picked up three sixes for the first time in the tournament's history and another four for their Original Set Pattern Dance which, with their gold finish, gives them a career total of 107 perfect marks, more than any previous skaters. Torvill and Dean now have only their world championship to defend before starting a lucrative professional career.  Torvill and Dean's Olympic gold was followed up with a record-breaking maximum points in the world figure-skating championship shortly after. It was their fourth world title in their amateur career. In 1984 they were also crowned BBC Sports Personality Of The Year. The duo went on to win the European Championships in 1994 and they made a dramatic return to the Olympic stage in Lillehammer, Norway in that same year, picking up a bronze medal. They performed together for the last time on the Canadian Stars Ice tour in 1998 before they announced their retirement from a 23-year partnership. A year later Torvill and Dean were awarded an OBE. The pair were reunited on ice in 2006 when they took part in a celebrity show for ITV, Dancing on Ice, where they provided commentary and coaching for the contestants.   "
366,"Glaxo Wellcome announced its merger with SmithKline Beecham in January 2000.  The deal would form the world's largest pharmaceutical company, but Glaxo already knows how to play the merger game.  The company was created in March 1995, when Glaxo took over Wellcome for £9bn, in what was then the biggest merger in UK corporate history.  At that time it was the darling of the corporate world, enjoying a major success with Zantac, a treatment for ulcers that was the best-selling drug in the world.  Since then, Glaxo, has struggled to find a replacement for its blockbuster, whose patent has expired in the US, and for Zovirax, Wellcome's anti-herpes drug which has already become available without a prescription.  Glaxo had high hopes for its anti-flu drug, Relenza, and was furious when the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence told doctors not to routinely prescribe the drug on the National Health Service.  Glaxo's chief executive, Sir Richard Sykes, led a campaign by the drug industry against the decision, threatening to reduce its research and development spending in Britain.  In 1999 Glaxo's shares suffered, underperforming the market by 27% as the company missed its ambitious profit target.  Glaxo originates in New Zealand, where it was founded in 1873 by Joseph Nathan as a general trading company. The firm produced its first medical product, a vitamin D preparation, in 1924.  But it was only in the 1980s, with the development of Zantac, that it became a major force in the pharmaceutical industry.  The Burroughs Wellcome & Company, meanwhile, was founded in 1880 in London by two pharmacists from the United States, Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs.  The Wellcome foundation, now Wellcome Trust, was founded as early as 1924, and became the firm's majority stakeholder 12 years later.  The company pioneered medical research, as well as developing well-known home remedies like Calpol.  It also played a major role in developing Retrovir, a drug that limits the spread of Aids, although it was criticised by some gay activists for charging too much for the medicines.  In 1988, Nobel prize for medicine was awarded jointly to Dr Gertrude Elion and Dr George Hitchings, two Wellcome researchers.  Nowadays, Glaxo Wellcome is among the world's ten largest drugs companies and employs 59,000 people worldwide, including 13,400 in the UK.  The firm owns 76 operating companies and runs more than 50 manufacturing sites worldwide.  During 1998, pre-tax profits stood at £2.67bn ($4.37bn) on a turnover of £7.98bn ($13.1.bn).  Glaxo Wellcome describes itself less as a maker of drugs, but as ""one of the world's leading research-based pharmaceutical companies"" with an annual research and development budget of £1.2bn.  Seven of the company's products are listed among the world's top 50 best-selling drugs.  Coldsore treatment Zovirax, anti-asthma drug Ventolin, migraine drug Imigran and Aids treatments Retrovir and Epivir are among its leading products.  In the UK, the company has research sites at Ware and Stevenage in Hertfordshire, Greenford in London and Dartford and Beckenham in Kent.  Manufacturing plants are based at Ulverston in Cumbria, Barnard Castle in County Durham, Speke on Merseyside and Montrose in north-east Scotland.  It also has major worldwide research centres in North Carolina in the United States and in Japan, and further production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East.  The modern company is largely the creation of Sir Richard Sykes, a research scientist who also led the development of many of Glaxo's most successful drugs.  He was born in 1942, a carpenter's son from Yorkshire.  He put himself through night school, and went on to become a scientist, earning two doctorates - one in science at London University and another in microbial biochemistry at Bristol University.  He first joined Glaxo in 1972. Five years later he worked for US rival Squibb, before returning to Glaxo in 1986.  He is the company's chief executive since 1993.  When he turns 60 in 2002, he will leave the new merged Glaxo SmithKline to run Imperial College London."
367,"Carlisle United have revealed plans to move from their Brunton Park home to a new stadium at Kingmoor in the north of the city.  The plans that would see a new 12,000 all-seater stadium built, ending a 102-year stay at their present home, were revealed to shareholders on Thursday.  Funding for the venue and surrounding buildings under the proposals would come from a development partner.  In addition, the new stadium would have office and training facilities.  A feasibility study found that the club's current site was a costly and unsuitable option for redevelopment.  Kingmoor Park was recommended by the study from 17 potential sites.  ""Everyone was very happy with the proposal,"" CUFC Online independent website editor Tim Graham told BBC Radio Cumbria, having attended the meeting.  ""From what the board were saying and the feasibity study, everyone in the meeting was for it.  ""Once everyone realises what's involved with it, I think a lot of people will be for it to be honest.""  The Cumbrians' existing ground meets the criteria set by the Football League to play in the bottom two tiers, but would not be suitable under regulations beyond that for the Championship.  ""Football League regulations, released in 2009, stipulated minimum ground standards which we are currently struggling to meet within Brunton Park,"" chairman John Nixon said within the statement.  ""The board would be doing a disservice to the fans if we didn't look into the future options for the club and report back to them for their input.""  Carlisle's next step is to present the findings and results of the study to supporters, which will take place on 24 November."

369,"Hamed, 31, and two others were arrested after the star's Mercedes sports car collided with another car in Sheffield on Monday, injuring two people.  South Yorkshire Police said three men were arrested on suspicion of leaving the scene of an accident.  The three also face claims they attempted to pervert the course of justice. They were bailed until August.  The accident happened in Ringinglow Road at about 1430 BST on Monday.  Police said the boxer's Mercedes was travelling out of the city with a Ford Mondeo when the star's car was in collision with a Volkswagen Golf driving in the opposite direction.  The driver of the Golf had to be cut free from his car before being airlifted to hospital with a suspected broken leg and fractures to both arms. A female passenger also sustained cuts and bruises.  Half of the front wing of the boxer's car was ripped off in the accident.  Earlier, a police spokesman said: ""As a result of a road collision, three men have been arrested and taken into custody.  ""A 31-year-old and two 26-year-olds are helping us with our inquiries.""  He added that one of the 26-year-old men under arrest was taken to hospital after suffering from chest pains."
370,"A Finnish tourist who chipped an ear off one of Easter Island's world-famous statues has been fined $17,000 (£8,500) and told to stay away for three years.  Marko Kulju, 26, deposited the money into a bank account overseen by the court that handled his case, Easter Island prosecutors said.  He also wrote a public apology for damaging one of the statues, which are protected under Chilean law.  The statues of Polynesian ancestors are believed to be up to 1,000 years old.  Kulju called his attempted theft of the ear ""the worst mistake of my life"" in comments published by the Santiago daily newspaper La Tercera.  He was detained last month and could have faced seven years in prison for his action.  Police on the Pacific island, which is an overseas territory of Chile, said a woman had seen him chip off the earlobe, which then fell and broke into pieces.  There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island in various stages of construction, some of them more than 10m (33ft) tall and weighing more than 80 tons.  The island's Rapa Nui National Park, in which the moai are situated, became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1995.     "

372,"Barclays Bank has been ordered by the Treasury to pay half-a-billion pounds in tax which it had tried to avoid.  Barclays was accused by HM Revenue and Customs of designing and using two schemes that were intended to avoid substantial amounts of tax.  The government has taken the unusual step of introducing retrospective legislation to end such ""aggressive tax avoidance"" by financial institutions.  Tax rules forced the bank to tell the authorities about its plans.  The government has closed the schemes to retrieve £500m of lost tax and safeguard payments of billions of more tax in the future.  BBC business editor Robert Peston has been told by Barclays that it is surprised by HMRC's reaction to the two schemes, which it believed to be in line with those used by other banks.  Our business editor says it is highly embarrassing for Barclays, because Britain's big banks have all signed a code committing them not to engage in tax avoidance.  However, he adds that Barclays may end up paying no more than £150m of additional tax.  Announcing the crackdown, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, said the bank should never have devised the schemes in the first place.  ""The bank that disclosed these schemes to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) has adopted the Banking Code of Practice on Taxation which contains a commitment not to engage in tax avoidance,"" he said.  ""The government is clear that these are not transactions that a bank that has adopted the code should be undertaking.  ""We do not take today's action lightly, but the potential tax loss from this scheme and the history of previous abuse in this area mean that this is a circumstance where the decision to change the law with full retrospective effect is justified.""  One tax scheme involved Barclays claiming it should not have to pay corporation tax on profits made when buying back its own IOUs.  The second tax avoidance scheme, also designed by Barclays, involved investment funds claiming that non-taxable income entitled the funds to tax credits that could be reclaimed from HMRC.  The Treasury described this as ""an attempt to secure 'repayment' from the Exchequer of tax that has not been paid"".  A Treasury source suggested that outlawing the tax schemes immediately would save the government a further £2bn in tax that would otherwise have been foregone.  Barclays disclosed the two schemes to the tax authorities under rules which have been in place since 2004.  Anyone, such as a bank, accountant, lawyer or tax adviser, who devises a seemingly legal tax avoidance plan, is obliged to tell the tax authorities about it within a few days of using it or marketing it to clients.  More than 2,000 schemes have been disclosed in the past eight years.  Mr Gauke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the experience of Barclays showed that the system of compulsory disclosure for legal tax avoidance schemes was working.  ""They have got caught, they disclosed this information, the HMRC has acted very quickly, there will be no benefit to the bank, they are clearly taking a substantial reputational hit and we have demonstrated that banks are simply not going to be able to get away with it,"" he said.  John Whiting, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT), said: ""Quite a few of the disclosures have come from banks in the past.  ""They [the schemes] are usually intended for sale to others such as clients.""  Thebanking code on taxationwas first introduced by the Labour government in June 2009.  It followed reports that some big banks used large scale tax avoidance schemes involving complex transactions and financial instruments.  The code - which was supported by the incoming coalition government the following year - demands that banks which sign ensure that their tax and the tax obligations of their customers are observed.  It says they should not go out of their way to avoid tax for themselves or clients.  The 15 biggest banks operating in the UK have signed up.  In a separate development, HMRC said it would appoint a senior official to act as an ""assurance commissioner"" for any tax deals struck with big companies for more than £100m.  The job of the commissioner will be to make sure taxpayers in general do not suffer from any such settlements.  The move follows severe criticism last December from MPs on the Public Accounts Committee who denounced HMRC for appearing to cut contentious tax deals with companies such as Vodafone and Goldman Sachs.  Lin Homer, the new HMRC chief executive said: ""This commissioner will take the role of challenging whether any proposed settlement secured the correct amount of tax efficiently and that taxpayers had been treated even-handedly.  ""The commissioner will also make sure that the governance procedures have been followed,"" she added."
373,"George Graham has always courted success but never popularity - which was just as well in the eyes of Spurs fans.  Graham's hasty departure from White Hart Lane was the inevitable conclusion to a war of attrition he was never going to win.  Spurs fans almost challenged him to win their hearts and minds by ditching his football principles that were set in stone to do things the so-called ""Tottenham way"".  They issued the challenge - then turned against him when it became clear Graham was only interested in his way not their way.  Graham's theory was based on the not unreasonable suggestion that Tottenham's traditional approach had brought a meagre return of one title in 40 years.  He won the occasional battle, lifting The Worthington Cup in 1999 shortly after his arrival from Leeds United and leading Spurs to FA Cup semi-final this season, but he was never going to win the war.  The tough Scot's football philosophy and background counted against him in the eyes of Spurs fans, who saw him tainted as a successful manager of bitter north London rivals Arsenal. They also saw him as the living embodiment of what they regarded as then chairman Sir Alan Sugar's failure to bond with the Spurs following. What chairman would genuinely believe he was giving Spurs fans a gift they wanted by appointing a hugely successful former Highbury legend who still had Arsenal shares as manager? Graham was given a welcome that could be described, at best, as cautious when he took over. The majority of supporters greeted him with reserve and suspicion, feelings that would run the entire length of his White Hart Lane reign. He never heard his name chanted by Spurs fans, some of whom would only call him ""the man in the raincoat"" rather than actually utter his name.  Graham was not prepared to alter his principles an inch to accommodate the feelings of the fans - and in the end it was his undoing. Indeed, after the influential Tottenham Action Group lobbied for a vote of no confidence in chairman Sugar and the Spurs board, Graham was swift to label them ""professional whingers."" It was hardly the act of a man intent on currying favour with the fans. He will believe he can leave Spurs with his head held high after plotting a dramatic FA Cup quarter-final win at West Ham last week. Graham is convinced he has a promising group of youngsters - but he was never going to change the Spurs' fans feelings towards him. He stoked up their rage before the start of the season by selling the beloved David Ginola to Aston Villa for £3m. Spurs fans were up in arms, and yet Graham's judgement has been proved correct as the flamboyant Ginola has been a major disappointment at Villa Park.  He offered up £11m Ukranian Sergei Rebrov as the player he believed would be as exciting and influential as Ginola, but with the added bonus of being a team player. So it was with heavy irony that Rebrov finally produced the form he is capable of by scoring twice in the game that was to prove to be Graham's Spurs swansong at West Ham. But he has also had to contend with the ""will he won't he"" Sol Campbell contract saga that took on the appearance of a daily soap opera to cast a shadow over Graham's work. The end, when it came, was unexpected and badly timed. George Graham has finally gone - defeated in a one-sided battle against Spurs fans and Spurs tradition. And it is highly unlikely there will be many tears shed inside White Hart Lane at his departure."
374,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Nottingham Panthers held off a relentless Cardiff Devils outfit to lift the Challenge Cup despite suffering a 5-4 defeat in a scintillating second leg at the National Ice Centre. Devils trailed 4-2 after last week's first leg in Wales but showed tremendous spirit to lead 2-0 and then 3-1 in the second period thanks to strikes from Tylor Michel, Wes Jarvis and Max Birbraer. But a pulsating second period from the Panthers in which Marty Gascon, Marc Levers and David Clarke all netted ultimately secured the win - and a second Challenge Cup success in three years. Cardiff's Mark Smith did ensure a dramatic finale with the only strike of a tense third period but the majority of the near 6,000-strong crowd went home happy as Panthers held on. Nottingham made a blistering start, seemingly desperate to snuff out any chance of a Devils comeback in the early exchanges. Visiting netminder Stevie Lyle pulled off a couple of fine early stops as Cardiff held out and then showed their intent to go all out for glory. They went ahead through a fabulous breakaway strike by Tylor Michel, who finished low and hard beyond Kevin St Pierre. St Pierre then gifted the visitors a second to make it 0-2 on the night when he inexplicably allowed a weak Wes Jarvis effort to dribble agonisingly over the line. In fairness, it may have taken a deflection off a Panthers defender on its way in but the end result was the same and of little consolation to St Pierre who looked crestfallen. Things could have been even worse for the home side, who survived 100 seconds of a five-on-three. But survive Panthers did and they calmed the nerves of the home fans when they took advantage of their own five-on-three to make it 2-1 when player-coach Corey Neilson notched from in front of the net. This is a quality sport, it's fast and furious, great fun, full of action and you're even allowed to have a rumble    The second period began in the same frantic manner with Marc Levers denied one-on-one by the excellent Lyle but Devils were quickly level on aggregate. Max Birbraer restored Cardiff's two-goal advantage with another quality finish after a glorious move from the right to the left circle. But the game turned on its head in a four-minute spell either side of the halfway mark. First an unbelievable strike by Marty Gascon, who somehow managed to drag his stick across the ice and finish low into the net despite being bundled to the surface and facing the wrong way. Not to be outdone, Levers then showed similar athleticism, shrugging off a challenge and shooting high into the net on the backhand. David Clarke completed a breathtaking spell for the Panthers with yet another backhand finish high into the roof of the net - his 36th goal of the season. But the Devils never let their spirits drop and a sweeping move saw Birbraer ram home his second to tie the scores at 4-4 on the night. The visitors stormed into the third period and Matt Miller had two stabs at reducing the arrears to a single goal. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. At the other end, Jay Henderson sent a clever flicked effort narrowly wide of the top corner. Both sides had good opportunities to add to their goal tally and although Smith did give the Devils a 5-4 win on the night, the Panthers held on for their third Challenge Cup win in the history of the competition. Panthers forward Kevin Bergin told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""Great team character tonight, they were up 2-0 and we had a great, great comeback. ""One down, two to go I guess [as they chase the Elite League title and play-offs].""     "
375,"Thousands of people are reported to have been killed and many others injured in a poison gas attack on a Kurdish city in northern Iraq.  Up to 20 aircraft, said to include Iraqi Migs and Mirages, were seen overhead at around 1100 local time in Halabja.  According to experts, the chemicals dropped by the planes may have included mustard gas, the nerve agents sarin, tabun and VX and possibly cyanide.  The attack on Halabja, which is about 150 miles (241km) north-east of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, is the latest in the Iran-Iraq war and follows its occupation by Iranian forces.  Iraq was said to be keen to avenge the fall of Halabja, which is seen as an important centre for Kurdish resistance in their struggle for autonomy.  The assault came after two days of conventional mortars, artillery and rockets from nearby mountains.  According to pro-Iranian Kurdish commanders in Halabja, there were up to 14 aircraft sorties, with seven to eight planes in each group.  The planes were believed to have concentrated their attacks on the city and all the roads leading out of it.  Eyewitnesses have told of clouds of smoke billowing upward ""white, black and then yellow""', rising as a column about 150 feet (46 metres)in the air.  Most of the wounded, who were taken to hospital in the Iranian capital Tehran, were suffering from mustard gas exposure.  Those who escaped death have developed respiratory or visual problems from the cocktail of chemicals dropped on the city.  According to some reports, up to 75% of the victims were women and children.  The injured survivors seen by reporters showed the classic symptoms of mustard gas poisoning - ugly skin lesions and breathing difficulties.  Some residents survived by covering their faces with damp cloths and taking to the mountains around Halabja.  One resident, Abdul Rahman, 60, an employee at the city's mosque, said: ""I do not know where my children are."""
376,"Former Hull FC centre Martin Gleeson, chief executive James Rule and coach Ben Cooper have all been banned for anti-doping rule breaches.  Former Great Britain international Gleeson failed a drugs test in May and Rule and Cooper were ""complicit in the lies"" that followed the test.  Gleeson, 31, who left the club in September, has been banned for three years, with half of that suspended.  Rule is banned for two years and Cooper for two years, with one suspended.  Gleeson played his last game for the club against Harlequins on 12 June, nearly one month after testing positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine following a game at Salford - in which he scored two tries - on 13 May.  He was subsequently absent from the team and his omission, it was claimed, was due to a stress-related illness.  Gleeson had his contract terminated in September.  The judgment from UK Anti-Doping reveals that Gleeson ingested the stimulant inadvertently while taking a dietary supplement he mistakenly believed to have been approved.  He initially claimed to have bought the supplement himself and had received clearance to take it from Cooper.  He later admitted, however, that he had obtained it from his former team-mate Sean Long ""and did not speak to Mr Cooper himself but instead relied on Mr Long's (truthful) statement that he had sought and obtained Mr Cooper's clearance to use the supplement"".  Cooper and Rule were also found to have made false statements on the matter.  A statement from UK Anti-Doping read: ""James Rule and Ben Cooper were charged with conspiring with Martin Gleeson to cover up the circumstances which led to Mr Gleeson testing positive for a banned stimulant.  ""Mr Gleeson was charged by UK Anti-Doping in June 2011 with committing an anti-doping rule violation after he tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine on 13 May 2011.  ""He was banned for two years by the National Anti-Doping Panel (following a hearing on 9 June 2011), and later admitted lying to the National Anti-Doping Panel about the circumstances that led to him testing positive.  ""Mr Cooper and Mr Rule were charged with being complicit in these lies, in violation of Rule 2.5 of the RFL's Anti-Doping Rules.  ""Mr Gleeson agreed to a three-year ban being imposed by the National Anti-Doping Panel, with half that ban suspended in recognition of his providing assistance to UK Anti-Doping.""  UK Anti-Doping chief executive Andy Parkinson said: ""This case marks two firsts for the anti-doping community. It is the first time that tampering with the doping control process in this manner has resulted in a violation, and the first time that members of an athlete's entourage have been convicted of anti-doping rule violations in the UK.""  RFL chief executive Nigel Wood added: ""Such behaviour is unacceptable and this case has brought the sport of rugby league into disrepute. We must applaud UK Anti-Doping for the hours of work they have put in to conduct a detailed and extensive investigation.""  Gleeson's ban expires on 12 November 2012, while conditioning coach Cooper can return on 8 June 2012 and Rule's ban lasts for another year."
377,"Correspondents say the blast in the al-Doura area, apparently aimed at a police patrol, is the deadliest car bombing in the capital in weeks.  The market was mostly used by Shia Muslims.  The blast came as visiting UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw urged Iraqi leaders to put aside sectarianism to form a government of national unity.  Doura is considered one of the most dangerous areas of the capital, with bombings a regular occurrence since the Sunni Arab-dominated militant insurgency began in 2003.  The explosion, which police said was detonated by remote control, left a number of cars and shops ablaze at the Abu Dshir general market.  Witnesses said some of the dead were passing motorists.  Women were reported to be screaming ""Our children have died"" and ""The terrorists, may God punish them.""  In other developments on Tuesday:  Tuesday's market blast came as Mr Straw held talks with Shia, Sunni Arab and Kurd leaders amid slow progress in forming a new coalition government.  Shia leaders say they have the right to control key posts after winning 128 of the 275 seats in parliament after December's elections.  But Sunni Arab leaders want to ensure they are represented at a senior level, and are seeking to break the control of Shia militias on the interior ministry.  Following talks with President Jalal Talabani, Mr Straw said Iraqis wanted a government that bound together different segments of society.  The US warned that aid to Iraq would be cut if the new government included politicians with a strong sectarian bias.  The Iraqi prime minister dismissed the US warning.  Ibrahim Jaafari said he did not want a sectarian government, but would not accept interference in what was an ""internal Iraqi affair"".  ""We do not need anybody to remind us, thank you."""
378,"Ukraine is observing a day of national mourning for more than 40 people who died when a new Ukrainian plane crashed into a mountain in Iran on Monday.  Black-ribboned state flags flew at half-mast across the country.  Most of those who died were Ukrainian or Russian aeronautical engineers, including many senior officials from the plant where the plane was designed and built.  They were on their way to Isfahan for the official inauguration of the Iranian version of the plane, which is being built under licence.  Iranian officials at first said they believed pilot error was to blame for Monday's crash, but later said it was too early to determine what caused the accident.  Investigators in Iran say they have recovered the black box of the Antonov An-140 twin-engine turboprop.  Rescue teams have recovered the bodies of at least 44 people, including many aviation experts.  The plane crashed into a mountainside on Monday evening as it was preparing to land in Isfahan, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) south of the capital Tehran.  ""It was an excellent plane and those on board were the best aviation experts that Russia and Ukraine have,"" said Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych.  The plane had taken off from Kharkiv, Ukraine, and made a brief stop at Trabzon in Turkey before flying on to Iran.  However, as it was nearing the airstrip at Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries, near Isfahan, witnesses saw the plane hit a mountain, an Iranian official told Reuters news agency.  Air traffic controllers said the plane lost contact minutes before it was due to land.  The Ukrainian President, Leonid Kuchma, and Iranian Transport Minister Ahmad Khorram offered condolences to families of the victims.  The An-140 is a modern twin-turboprop commuter plane which made its maiden flight in 1999 and has rarely been involved in accidents.  Iran is assembling An-140s - renamed the Iran-140 locally - under licence from Ukraine.  ""It was the same model plane that we are developing with Ukraine, but I don't think the crash will affect this project,"" Mr Khorram told Reuters news agency."
379,"It was a spectacular end for the robotic probe, which has spent the last 16 months testing innovative and miniaturised space technologies.  Smart 1 has also produced detailed maps of the Moon's chemical make-up, to help refine theories about its birth.  At 0542 GMT (0642 BST), the probe thumped into a volcanic plain.  With an impact speed of about 7,200km/h (4,500mph), even at a glancing blow of just one degree to the surface, the probe met a sufficiently violent end for telescopes to observe the event from Earth.  Smart 1 was returning pictures as it plunged towards the Moon's Lake of Excellence. Controllers and scientists at the European Space Agency's (Esa) operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany, clapped and cheered after the spacecraft smacked into the surface.  The Canada France Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, in Hawaii, captured an infrared picture of a bright flash as Smart 1 hit its target.  ""I was really surprised as the flash was very impressive. I was betting on not seeing much,"" said Gerhard Schwehm, mission manager for Smart 1.  The hope now is that the impact will have kicked up a big enough plume of fresh lunar ""soil"" for scientists to study its composition using ground telescopes.  The impact was expected to leave a 3m by 10m (10ft by 30ft) crater on the Moon, spreading debris over 80 sq km (30 sq miles).  A fleet of spacecraft - both orbiters and landers - are now expected to visit the Moon in the next few years.  Smart 1 was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket in September 2003 as a technology demonstrator.  It became Europe's first space science mission to use an ion engine instead of chemical combustion to reach its destination.  The system drew power through the probe's solar wings and then used this energy to propel the spacecraft forward by expelling charged particles of xenon. It was highly efficient, covering 100 million km in a series of looping orbits and using just 60 litres of ""fuel"".  Professor Manuel Grande has been principal investigator on one of Smart's miniaturised instruments: the compact X-ray spectrometer known as D-CIXS.  Knowing the absolute abundances of these elements will help to refine theories for the Moon's formation. These describe the satellite emerging from the debris thrown out from a mighty collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body billions of years ago.  ""It will take a long time for to work through the detail; the devil is in the detail with the X-ray instruments,"" said the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, researcher.  ""But when we finally put the picture together what we will get is maps of what the Moon is made of.""  On Saturday, mission controllers had to raise Smart 1's orbit by 600m (2,000ft) to avoid hitting a crater rim on final approach. Had the orbit not been raised, the craft would have crashed one orbit too soon - making the impact difficult or impossible to observe.  ""Smart 1 will now rest in peace on the Moon,"" said Professor Foing.  ""We are now collaborating with the international community, preparing the way for the future exploration of the Moon - the next fleet of orbiters, landers; leading to robotic villages and human bases."""
380,"Serge Gainsbourg, perhaps best known in the UK for his banned record 'Je T'aime (Moi Non Plus)' , was one of the biggest stars in French music in the second half of the 20th Century. He rose to fame as a singer/songwriter in the mid-1950s and, with some ups and downs, consistently penned hit records, whether performed by himself or others, until his death in 1991. Alongside his musical achievements, Gainsbourg was also in love with the world of film, appearing in many French pictures as well as directing and producing some of his own. He is almost as well-known in France, though, for his relationships with a string of popular divas, including the love of his life, English rose Jane Birkin, who supplied the ecstatic sighs for the best-known version of 'Je T'aime' . He's almost as renowned for making provocative public statements and actions in the media as for his impressive discography. Loved by many, loathed by a few; it is fair to say this unique character achieved legendary status in 20th-Century French popular culture.  Lucien Ginsbourg, later known to the French public as Serge Gainsbourg, came into the world a few moments after his twin sister Liliane on 2 April, 1928. The proud parents, Joseph and Olga Ginsburg, were Russian Jews who had fled the anti-Jewish Bolshevik movement and settled in France in the early 1920s after a long and difficult journey via Georgia and Turkey. By the time Lucien was born, the Ginsburg family were living in a flat in the relatively humble 20th district of Paris. Joseph, a talented artist and pianist, was establishing a good reputation on the piano-bar circuit in Paris and earning extra money providing entertainment in flashy holiday resorts in the summer season. The 1930s were a prosperous period for the hard-working head of the Ginsburg family and though he sometimes took his family with him to his longer provincial engagements, young Lucien spent most of these pre-teen years in Paris.  With the outbreak of WWII, times were to change for the Jewish Ginsburg family. Joseph was no longer allowed to work as a pianist in the Paris bars and eventually decided to flee to the 'free zone' in the south, leaving his family behind in Paris. As well as attending school in the early 1940s, Lucien also studied art at the Montmartre Academy. By late 1943 Joseph had managed to make arrangements to bring his family to the town of Limoges, where they were reunited in early 1944, only to be arrested and forced to flee once again - though this time they remained together. When Paris was liberated in 1945, the Ginsburgs returned to their apartment there and turned the page on a painful period; Olga's brother was not so fortunate; he never returned from the concentration camp to which the Vichy regime had sent him.  In his final year of school in post-war Paris, Lucien was not a happy student and felt ugly - particularly because of his big nose and ears. It was at this time that he took up smoking, which was to become a lifelong habit and a personal trademark. Despite failing his baccalaureat exams, he stayed on at his Montmartre art college to study architecture. Above all, though, he wanted to follow in his father's artistic footsteps and he soon gave up on architecture and began to paint prolifically. Living in a garret room in the same building as his parents' Paris flat, he stopped attending his art classes, concentrating instead on his own works and copying many great paintings from the Louvre. It is said he produced more than 400 canvases during this period, before he suddenly decided to burn them all in a dramatic gesture of dissatisfaction with his own work.  In spite of this, a few of his paintings from this time are known to have survived, including a self-portrait from 1957.  At the Montmartre Academy in 1947, Lucien met and fell in love with the daughter of a Russian aristocratic family, Elizabeth Levitsky, fashion model and secretary to surrealist poet Georges Hugnet. Duty called, however, and in 1948 he was required to complete his national service, despite having enrolled in the Ecole Normale de Musique in a bid to avoid it. He would later say that it was during his national service that he learned to drink. On his return to civilian life a year later, he moved in with 'Lise' and, although dreaming of returning to music and painting, took a position in a centre for Jewish children, where he appears to have shown some talent for teaching. He stayed for two years, marrying Lise in November 1951 before moving back to Paris in the following year and taking to the bar circuit as a musician. He soon abandoned his ambitions as a painter entirely and, through his father's contacts, landed a steady job as a pianist/guitarist at the Club de la Forêt in Le Touquet. Although he had already written a few songs to entertain the kids at the centre, it was not until 1954 that he registered his first songs (six of them) with the SACEM under the pseudonym Lucien Grix. He had taken his first step in what would be a monumental career as a singer/songwriter.  Between 1954 and 1957, Lucien supported his family through regular appearances at the Club de la Forêt and from 1955 on, he could also be seen conducting a small orchestra at Madame Arthur's, a cabaret club specialising in drag acts where he wrote songs and generally collaborated with the artistic director Louis Laibe. By 1957 he was also working at another club, the Milord L'Arsouille, where he changed his pseudonym to Serge Barthélémy and registered, among others, the song that would shoot him to national fame, 'Le Poinçonneur des Lilas' . In October of that year, though, Lucien and Elisabeth Ginsburg were divorced. Two months later, he recorded 'Le Poinçonneur des Lilas'. It was also around this time that he played piano one night for Boris Vian at the Milord and was inspired by the legendary surrealist writer/singer/songwriter's material and stage performance. During this time the young songwriter produced some pretty saucy lyrics, already beginning to use the kind of provocative wordplay that would become his trademark.  On 29 March, 1958, under the new stage name of Serge Gainsbourg, he appeared for the first time on French television, performing 'Le Poinçonneur'. Over the course of that spring, people began to take notice of the odd-looking young singer-songwriter. In July he was back on the box, performing 'Douze Belles dans la Peau', an early example of the kind of (untranslatable) wordplay in his titles and lyrics that would become another of his trademarks. He also continued writing for others as he did over the years with remarkable success, particularly for some of the most glamorous female vocalists of the times. It was at about this time that he took part in the stage show Opus 109 (another play on words - cent neuf the number 109 and Sang neuf - new blood). 1959 saw Serge Gainsbourg become a household name for the first time. In early 1959, Opus 109 took to the road, with fellow up-and-coming 'chanteur' Jacques Brel headlining. In spring he was back on the television and in April he shared the 'variety' award at the 'Festival International de Haute Fidélité et de Stéréophonie. A second record was released in June, followed by another television appearance in July only to top it all in November by recording an EP of his songs performed by the massive star of La Chanson Française, Juliette Gréco. It was also around this time that he began to dabble in acting , appearing in a minor role in the 1959 Brigitte Bardot film Voulez-vous Danser avec Moi?  January 1960 saw the release of his first hit record, the eponymous title track of the soundtrack for the film L'eau à la Bouche, which sold over 100,000 copies and still receives regular airplay in France today. In December he performed another song that would become a Gainsbourg classic, 'La Chanson de Prévert', on television. During the early sixties, his songs tended to be most successful when performed by others, especially his collaborations with Juliette Gréco. This is not to say that he did not release his own renditions, but they were never as successful as those performed by better-established stars of the Rive Gauche scene. Throughout this time, he also appeared regularly at various clubs and theatres to great applause, gaining a reputation as something of a dandy with misogynist tendencies. In late 1962, he wrote his first song for Brigitte Bardot, 'L'Appareil à Sous', and in January 'La Javanaise' was a huge hit for Gréco, as it would later be for Gainsbourg himself. Early in 1963, he was in Hong Kong working on L'Inconnue de Hong Kong and in June he felt confident enough to announce that 'La Nouvelle Vague, C'est Moi'. So by November of that year, when he recorded his first full album Gainsbourg Confidentiel, he was a successful figure in the French music industry, if not yet an established star in his own right. This he would achieve through his collaboration with a young female vocalist named France Gall.  On 7 January, 1964 Gainsbourg married Françoise Pancrazzi, also known as la princesse, just as his first full album, Gainsbourg Confidentiel, hit the record shops all over France. He continued to write for other artists, though, and it was in March 1964 that he wrote the first of a series of songs for petite blonde starlet France Gall, 'N'écoute pas les Idoles'. In August his wife gave birth to a baby girl, Nathalie. By this time, he was performing to packed crowds at the Milord while spending his days recording a second album, Gainsbourg Percussions, released in November. With its innovative Afro-Cuban rhythms, Percussions contained many songs that would stand the test of time, but it was a move away from the Rive Gauche style that his established fans expected and received mixed reviews. Even so, 1964 saw him write several more songs for France Gall, as well as other stars such as Petula Clarke (O ô shérif), and Serge Regianni ('Quand J'aurai du Vent dans mon Crâne').  1965 was the crucial year in Gainsbourg's career. He kicked off with an interview in which he announced that he was turning his back on so-called 'literary songs' in favour of good honest rock music, but when touring as a support act for Barbara, he was disheartened by the poor public reaction, became depressed and abandoned the tour after just five shows. In the recording studio, though, he had started the year with a second collaboration with Bardot ('Bubble Gum') and the enormous hit 'Les P'tits Papiers' for Régine. It was France Gall's performance of his 'Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son', though, that launched them both into the upper echelons of French pop music stardom. The catchy pop number not only carried all before it at the Eurovision Song Contest that March, it was also, unlike some winners of that August's assembly of Europe's musical talent, a huge hit with the public, shooting to number one all over Europe .  Suddenly thrust to star status all over Europe, and for the first time in his life a wealthy man, Gainsbourg continued to write for France Gall and penned a string of hits for other artists, often, but not exclusively, female. It was at this time that he openly explained in an interview that he had changed style in order to succeed, calculating that if he wrote twelve songs and put them all on a Serge Gainsbourg album, ten of them would probably never be successful; whereas if he gave them to other established artists to perform, they could all be hits. Nonetheless, he did release one EP of his own in 1966, 'Qui est In, Qui est Out', recorded in London with Arthur Greenslade. Meanwhile, freed from financial worries, the versatile artiste was devoting himself to his acting career, featuring alongside Jean Seberg in the sixties caper movie Estouffade à la Caraïbe, episodes of several popular television series and a string of minor French films throughout 1966-67. Perhaps the most memorable was the musical Anna, for which he wrote much of the soundtrack. It seems, however, that his personal life was suffering under the strain of all this success, and in the summer of 1966 he was divorced from his second wife, from whom he had been separated since late 1965. Although they did get back together for a time, they would soon split definitively when Gainsbourg entered into a relationship that would confirm his megastar status with the French public and inspire some of his biggest hit records.  Brigitte Bardot had had a first hit with the Gainsbourg-penned 'Bubble Gum' in the summer of 1965, but it had been rather overshadowed by the Eurovision victory. But in May 1967, BB asked him to write 'la plus belle chanson d'amour qu'il puisse imaginer.' . Gainsbourg claimed to have written his response, 'Je T'aime (Moi non Plus)', along with two other hit-songs-to-be, 'Harley Davidson' and 'Bonnie and Clyde', during the night of 26-27 May, 1967. In June 1967, the outbreak of the Six-Day War in Israel distracted Gainsbourg, once persecuted by the collaborationist Vichy regime, and inspired him to write a military marching song for the Israeli army, 'Le Sable et le Soldat'. For the rest of that summer he was filming Ce Sacré Grand-père with Michel Simon, and later the film Le Pacha with Jean Gabin, perhaps most notable for the classic Gainsbourg track 'Requiem pour un Con', included on the soundtrack. So it wasn't until October that he began recording work with Bardot and then the relationship quickly went beyond the studio and into the bedroom. It was to be a short, but intense and very public affair. In December they recorded the hit single 'Harley Davidson', and in January 1968 they produced the legendary Show Bardot on television - in which France's favourite female star performed some of their favourite musical auteur's latest material. In the few weeks they were together, they collaborated on two enormously successful albums, Bonny and Clyde and Initiales BB before their relationship imploded as quickly as it had begun and they went their separate ways.  As France was in the throes of the social revolution known as 'the events of May 1968', Serge was in London auditioning for a film called 'Slogan' and it was here that he met the girl who would be the love of his life, Jane Birkin. In spite of an inauspicious start they embarked on a love affair that - despite the fact they ultimately split - would remain the most important of his life. In June, when filming began in Paris, their initial dislike for one another quickly mutated into a passionate love affair that was to last for twelve years. In November they recorded together, including the notorious 'Je T'aime (Moi Non Plus) . 1968 had been a busy year for Gainsbourg; since his much-publicised affair/collaboration with Bardot, he had found time between appearing in and writing soundtracks for several films and following Jane (a rising star at that time) around Europe, to continue writing for other performers, including another hit single for Régine 'Ouvre la Bouche, Ferme les Yeux'.  Early 1969 found Gainsbourg trying to launch Jane's career as a singer. They performed together on stage and also appeared together in several films with limited success. In August the risqué 'Je T'aime (Moi Non plus)' hit number one in the UK charts and had similar success in other European countries - though the erotic 'panting' caused outrage, particularly in Italy and Catholic circles generally. Perhaps unsurprisingly, in the 'Summer of Love', this did nothing to reduce (indeed, may well have increased) sales in France and following a second pressing sales topped the one million mark. In August the official Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore, denounced 'Je T'aime' as obscene. In September, other countries followed Italy's lead and the record was banned from radio and television in Sweden, Spain and the UK. Whether in a bid to capitalise on the publicity, or simply in phase with their times, the couple released a second sexually-charged single, '69, Année Erotique', taken from their album Jane Birkin, Serge Gainsbourg.  Throughout the early 1970s, Serge seems to have indulged his love of acting, appearing in a string of obscure films (both with and without Jane). Nonetheless, he did find time to record a single album in 1971, in the form of a kind of musical 'tale' entitled L'Histoire de Melodie Nelson. It was a year that brought him grief and joy in his private life; in April, his father Joseph died and in July Jane gave birth to a baby girl, Charlotte. The happy couple eventually married in the spring of 1972, in a remarkable ceremony at the Gare de Lyon. A sumptuous buffet was laid out in the departure hall followed by a masked ball, at the end of which the bride and groom boarded a train to a secret honeymoon destination. That year also saw him return to writing for other artists, including Juliette Gréco, France Gall, Régine and his first collaboration with Jacques Dutronc.  On 15 May, 1973 Gainsbourg suffered the first sign that his hard-drinking, chain-smoking lifestyle was taking its toll: he had a heart attack. By September, though, he was releasing an album of original material, Vu de L'Extérieur, including the classic hit single 'Je suis Venu te Dire que Je M'en Vais'. It was to be the first of three albums produced in London with a group of English musicians. In June 1974, he was back in front of the camera, playing the lead role in a short film that provided the supporting feature for the latest instalment of the Emmanuelle series . After a period working with the radical new star of the French rock scene, Jacques Dutronc, in early 1975, Gainsbourg released a provocative album, Rock Around the Bunker, comprising a confusing collection of songs, some of them bizarrely upbeat, relating to various aspects of the Nazi regime. As a foil to this strangely provocative production, the summer saw the release of the raucously lightweight, but undeniably fun, 'L'Ami Caouette', about a peanut that just wants to have a good time!  The late 1970s was a quiet time for the now aging auteur. The rest of 1975 was spent on his debut film behind the camera, Je T'aime, Moi Non Plus, which came out in March the following year. Early 1976 saw him honing his directorial skills on a series of adverts, and after the premiere of Je T'aime (for which of course he wrote and released the soundtrack), he produced another experimental album, L'Homme à la Tête de Chou which would not appear in the shops until January 1977. In June 1978, he had a big hit with the summer single 'Sea, Sex and Sun', which would later be used by Patrice Leconte as the title music for his hugely successful film Les Bronzés.  Still, Gainsbourg had one more trick up his sleeve before facing the 1980s, and in 1979, with astonishing vision, he set off to Kingston to record a reggae album, engaging the talents of Sly Dunbar (drums) and Robbie Shakespeare (bass) - musicians usually associated with Peter Tosh, but who also worked with Black Uhuru and Gregory Isaacs and subsequently with Bob Dylan, Ian Dury and Joe Cocker. They were accompanied by Sticky Thompson, Mikey 'Mao' Chung on keyboards, Radcliffe Bryan on guitar, as well as Bob Marley's backing vocal trio, Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths. The resulting album, Aux Armes et Caetera was largely written and entirely recorded in just five days at Island Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In April, Gainsbourg performed his reggae version of 'La Marseillaise' on French television and the album went platinum within six months. This use of the national anthem, however, sparked outrage among the right-wing press (not forgetting that Gainsbourg was Jewish) and provoked the outrage of many French right-wingers and particularly soldiers. In December of that year, Gainsbourg returned to the stage for the first time in fourteen years to perform with his group of Jamaican musicians, meeting with considerable success in spite of the ongoing Marseillaise scandal.  By 1980, as he was in his mid-50s, Gainsbourg was entering the fourth decade of his career and a new generation of fans was just beginning to discover his music. Though it was to be his last, it is fair to say that he continued to be innovative in his work and provocative in all things to the end. A famous incident took place on 11 March, 1984. Having spent the spring making a number of television commercials, Serge turned up drunk for a live television interview. As the nervous presenters tried to keep away from anything too scandalous, they found themselves asking him about income tax. Calmly joking about the 74 percent of his income that he had to hand over to the taxman, he promptly whisked out a 500 franc note and set it alight, leaving it to burn until only a quarter remained. Waving out the flames, he commented that that 'was all that was left to him out of every 500 francs he earned!  Then there was the Whitney Houston incident. Arriving on a talk show drunk on 5 April, 1986, our man sat down next to Whitney and immediately said in heavily-accented English, 'I'd like to f*** you.' This causes a bit of a stir, as it is one of the most widely-recognised words in the English language. The presenter tried to smooth over the incident, claiming that he had said he'd like to 'flirt' with Whitney. But Gainsbourg was having none of that, insisting, 'No, I said I'd like to f*** her.' Greatly amused by his little outburst, he carried on, 'Now, hang on, I didn't say I wanted to f*** her here on the show! No, afterwards!' Needless to say, Miss Houston was more than a little shocked by this 60-year-old French crooner's rather crude display of appreciation , but she stayed nonetheless and sang a duet with him before the end of the show.  Early 1980 saw the publication of his only novel, Evguénie Sokolov. In August, after probably the happiest years of his often troubled personal life, Jane Birkin left him, taking their daughters Kate (13) and Charlotte (nine) with her. Meanwhile, after meeting Catherine Deneuve on the set of Je Vous Aime in which they both featured alongside Gerard Depardieu and other well-known stars, Gainsbourg wrote a number of songs for her, performed 'Dieu est un Fumeur de Havanes' on television as a duet and she released them as the album Souviens-toi de M'Oublier. In the spring of 1981, he met and began a relationship with 21-year-old Caroline Von Paulous, also known as Bambou. His second reggae album, Mauvaises Nouvelles des Etoiles, came out in November 1981. It was around this time that he appeared on TV with a black eye, explaining that he had been accosted coming out of a Champs-Elysees nightclub by some paratroopers who didn't like his recent material. In December 1981, perhaps as a kind of gesture of defiance towards those who had so disliked his treatment of the French national anthem, he acquired the original manuscript of the Marseillaise at auction. August 1983 saw the release of Equator, his second attempt at directing a feature-length film. In the second half of that year he wrote two albums, Baby Alone in Babylone for his estranged wife Jane, and Pull Marine for rising star of the silver screen Isabelle Adjani. As busy as ever, in 1984 he released the modern-sounding Love on the Beat featuring lots of synthesiser sounds and drum-machine beats, gaining him credibility with the eighties generation but causing a good deal of consternation among fans of his earlier work.  During the late 1980s, he would 'keep it in the family', beginning with a period of work involving his daughter Charlotte. 1985's Lemon Incest, a duet adapted from a tune by Chopin, caused a stir because it appeared to suggest a sexual relationship between father and 14-year-old daughter. Apart from a series of major concerts at the Casino de Paris in September/October, Serge had spent most of the year on his third offering as director, Charlotte Forever, released on 10 December. Daughter Charlotte played the title role and provided most of the vocals on the soundtrack, which was released the next year as an album under her name. In 1986 the original version of 'Je T'aime (Moi Non Plus)' with Bardot was finally released as a 12"" single, Serge continued to record with Charlotte as well as recording a debut single for his new main squeeze, Bambou, Lulu. 1987 was not so productive; just a new album for Jane, Lost Song and in October 1987 his final studio album under his own name, You're Under Arrest - with an unflattering mug-shot style photo of 'Gainsbarre' for the front cover. In March 1988, he played a series of dates at the huge Zénith in Paris, followed by a tour of France, releasing the highlights of the Zénith shows as a double-album later that year entitled simply Le Zénith de Gainsbourg. Though it may not have been the high-point of his career, it will be thought of by many as a glorious and fitting end to his live performances.  From January 1989, it was clear that Gainsbourg's health was deteriorating and he was in and out of hospital with liver problems, complicated by a related eye condition that threatened to leave him blind. In April he underwent extensive liver surgery and left hospital the same month. In May, a double live album of recordings from his Zénith concerts the previous year was released and in June he directed his fourth and final film, Stan the Flasher. With a box-set release in September 1989, it would be easy to imagine that there was no more to come from the prolific songwriter, but this was not the case. Before the end of that year he had written a full album for Bambou, Made in China, releasing several of the tracks as singles in a bid to launch her career in pop music that would prove unsuccessful. In 1990 he penned the lyrics for France's Eurovision entry, coming second, wrote eleven songs for a young up-and-coming singer named Vanessa Paradis, which formed the bulk of her second album Variations sur le Meme T'aime, and a final album for Jane entitled Amours des Feintes. He finally gave up the ghost on 2 March, 1990, and was buried five days later at the Montparnasse cemetery, final resting place of many eminent French literary figures including 19th-Century poet Charles Baudelaire and 20th Century writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Catherine Deneuve read one of his texts at the funeral."
381,"Spice Girls publicists have denied rumours that the group is splitting up following claims by Mel C that she ""does not intend to do any more work"" with the band.  It ain't over until it's over and it ain't over  Rumours of a split began circulating when the 27-year-old star told Reuters news agency: ""I don't intend to do any more work with the Spice Girls.  ""Really, I've not been comfortable being in the Spice Girls for probably the last two years.  ""It doesn't really feel that natural to me any more.  ""I've grown up and I just feel that I want to do things my own way and not compromise.""  Mel C is widely considered to be the strongest vocalist in the group and from an early stage was said to be unhappy about her ""Sporty Spice"" image.  But the Spice Girls publicity machine has brushed aside her comments, insisting the band has a strong future.  Spice Girls spokesman Alan Edwards said: ""Melanie C hasn't left the Spice Girls.  ""Everyone wants to say it's over but it isn't, the group have still got strong ties.  ""What she said is that we've got no plans at the moment and it's been exaggerated into the final split and it isn't the final split.  ""As everyone knows, the Spice Girls are pursuing their own solo projects but the Spice Girls still exists.  ""It ain't over until it's over and it ain't over."""
382,"The story of how James Ibori went from convicted thief in London in the 1990s, to become governor of a wealthy oil-producing Nigerian state and then to a British prison is a remarkable one.  It is the story of a wily political operator, backing the right political horses and shifting allegiances when expedient.  Given slightly different circumstances, according to one observer, it could have seen Ibori in the presidential villa rather than a British jail cell.  Ibori's defence in the face of allegations had always been that he had a successful business career and had made money independent of government.  But in 1991, he was working in a hardware store in the London suburb of Neasden.  The prosecution in this trial told a judge he was earning around £15,000 ($24,000) a year.  He was caught by his employer allowing his wife to walk through the till he was manning without paying for goods.  They both pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court and were fined.  In 1992, he was convicted for possession of a stolen credit card, which had £1,000 spent on it, and was again fined in a UK court.  Ibori then returned to Nigeria intending to become a political operator. The country was about to be tipped into a tumultuous period.  Military leader Ibrahim Babangida had scheduled elections to return Nigeria to democracy in June 1993.  Ibori worked for the governorship campaign of a friend.  The experience gave him good connections with the parties that would eventually merge to form the People's Democratic Party, currently ruling Nigeria.  The 1993 elections were cancelled by Mr Babangida. Later that year, Gen Sani Abacha staged a coup, cementing the military's grip on power for another five years.  According to Antony Goldman, who worked as a journalist in Nigeria for many years and has followed Ibori's career closely, this is when Ibori made his first shift of political master, offering his services to Abacha.  ""He had an unspecified role in security,"" Mr Goldman said. ""That could be anything, it was a very murky business.""  Abacha was accused of murdering political opponents and ruthlessly crushing dissent and pro-democracy movements.  In the mid-1990s, Ibori was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) in the US about how he came into the possession of millions of dollars that he transferred to accounts in the US.  The FBI suspected the money came from advance fee fraud, the infamous Nigerian 419 scam, but he was able to prove the money came from his work with Abacha, Mr Goldman said.  Abacha died in 1998 and Ibori switched horses again, attaching himself to influential northern politician Atiku Abubakar, who went on to become vice-president.  In 1999, Ibori took out a mortgage on a property in Abbey Road, London.  To do that, he got a new passport with a false birth date to mask his previous convictions.  The birth date he chose was in fact medically impossible as it was only a month after his sister's birthday, the prosecution told the court.  Ibori was installed as the governor of the oil-rich Delta State in the 1999 elections.  In order to take office in Nigeria, he had to swear an affidavit that he had no convictions. To do this, he used the same birth date he had made up to acquire his mortgage.  It was this evidence that would, in a London court 14 years later, spell the end for Ibori.  Soon after he became governor, Ibori paid off the Abbey Road mortgage in cash.  He went on to buy three other properties in the UK. He paid £2.2 million in cash for a house in the plush London suburb of Hampstead.  In 2005 the Metropolitan Police began to take an interest in Ibori after they came across a purchase order for a private jet, made through his solicitor in London.  It was just after this that Ibori shifted horses again, switching his allegiance from Mr Abubakar to the then President Olusegun Obasanjo.  In 2006, President Obasanjo recruited Ibori to help him force through a change in the constitution to allow him to run for a third term as president.  When that plan failed, Ibori promised his allegiance to Mr Obasanjo's anointed successor, Umaru Yar'Adua.  At the ruling party's pre-election convention in 2006, Ibori was on hand to lift up the northern governor's hands in a display of victory - hours before delegates from the People's Democratic Party (PDP) voted to select him as their candidate.  Ibori is then accused of bankrolling the 2007 Yar'Adua election campaign, although this has been denied.  Mr Goldman says he understands Ibori was promised the vice-president's job, in return for his support.  But Mr Yar'Adua, who had been ill for many years, died in office.  His Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan succeeded him and remains Nigeria's president.  Despite being a fellow former governor of a neighbouring oil state, Ibori and Mr Jonathan were by now political enemies.  In 2010, President Jonathan set the country's anti-corruption police, the Economic and Financial Crimes commission on him, but their officers were ambushed when they came to arrest him.  He went to Dubai, whose government arrested him and transferred him to the UK to face trial.  Mr Goldman says had Yar'Adua lived, and made Ibori his vice-president, he would have had a clear run to become president.  ""Then Mr Ibori would have met Queen Elizabeth at the state house, instead of serving at her pleasure,"" Mr Goldman said."
383,"UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was ""shocked"" at the ""apparently deliberate targeting"" of the post. Israel has expressed ""deep regret"".  Israel earlier said it would control an area in southern Lebanon until international forces deployed.  The force will be discussed at international crisis talks to be held in Rome on Wednesday.  The meeting is being attended by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Mr Annan, as well as foreign ministers and top officials from five European and four Arab countries.  BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall said the Italian prime minister and others believe a quick ceasefire to be the main priority.  But the US and Britain will not push for a ceasefire unless root causes of the conflict are addressed, she adds.  The summit will take place without a delegation from Israel.  Ms Rice will attend the talks after ending her tour of the Middle East on Tuesday.  More than 380 Lebanese and 42 Israelis have died in nearly two weeks of conflict in Lebanon, which began after Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid on 12 July.  The UN in Lebanon says the Israeli air force destroyed the post, in which four military observers were sheltering.  It said the four, from Austria, Canada, China and Finland, had taken shelter in a bunker under the post after it was earlier shelled 14 times by Israeli artillery.  A rescue team was also shelled as it tried to clear the rubble.  ""I am shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defence Forces of a UN Observer post in southern Lebanon,"" Mr Annan said in a statement from Rome.  Unifil has been operational in the border area since 1978 and is currently 2,000 strong.  Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has vowed the group will continue its rocket attacks on Israel.  Mr Nasrallah told Hezbollah's al-Manar television that the militant group would fire rockets deeper into Israel and would counter any Israeli advance into southern Lebanon, and criticised what he called an Israeli-US plan for a ""new Middle East"".  ""There is no way that we can accept any humiliating conditions on us, our people or our country... especially after all these sacrifices... we are open to political discussions and solutions with flexibility, but the dignity and national interest is a red line.""  Earlier, Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz had said a ""security zone"" in southern Lebanon would be maintained ""under the control of our forces if there is not a multinational force"".  He said: ""We have no other option. We have to build a new security strip that will be a cover for our forces.""  He did not specify whether Israeli troops would remain there but insisted they would ""continue to control [Hezbollah]"" in their operations.  Israeli government sources have estimated the width of the zone at anything from three to 10km (1.9-6.2 miles).  An unnamed Israeli official quoted by Reuters news agency said between 10,000 and 20,000 international peacekeepers would be needed.  BBC defence and security correspondent Rob Watson says Israeli details on the zone - and how it will be secured - are far from clear.  He says it is possible Mr Peretz is trying to put pressure on the international community to deliver the peacekeeping force.  Mr Abbas called for an immediate end to ""aggression against the Gaza Strip and the West Bank"" and for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in Lebanon.  Ms Rice said the only solution was a sustainable and enduring peace.  Her words were reinforced later by US President George W Bush who said: ""I support a sustainable ceasefire that will bring about an end to violence... Our mission and our goal is to have a lasting peace, not a temporary peace.""  In his meeting with Ms Rice, Mr Olmert said he was ""very conscious"" of the humanitarian needs of Lebanon's civilians, but insisted Israel was defending itself against terrorism."
384,"Dedicated fans are lining up outside the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood but have been told it will open on 19 May at a cinema a mile away.  Producers opted to open the film at the ArcLight cinema, making it unlikely other cinemas in the area will show it.  But the fans are refusing to move, believing the news to be false.  Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith will open at the ArcLight complex, which is adjacent to another Hollywood landmark, the Cinerama Dome.  ""We've heard all this before,"" said Sarah Sprague, one of the small group already queuing.  ""This is still the epicentre for Star Wars fans,"" Ms Sprague added.  ""For the big iconic pictures of the 1970s, people lining up were here. They weren't at the Cinerama Dome.""  Revenge of the Sith will be the last of three prequels to the original 1977 science fiction classic.  Executives from 20th Century Fox and ArcLight told Variety magazine Revenge of the Sith would be showing at the Arclight although a deal had yet to be completed.  In 2002, two die-hard fans started camping outside their local Seattle cinema four months before the release of Episode II: Attack of the Clones.  Despite mixed reviews for the past two Star Wars releases, anticipation for the final instalment is expected to be high.  Director George Lucas has said Revenge of the Sith is darker and more emotional than previous Star Wars films."
385,"Burundi's army has launched a counter-attack in the hills around Bujumbura after the capital was shelled by suspected rebels.  Four soldiers and 10 rebels were killed in the clashes, the government says.  A BBC correspondent in the city says the sound of explosions and gunfire could be heard throughout the night.  Peace deals have been signed with most of Burundi's rebel groups - including one which now forms the government - except the FNL, which remains active.  The military's deputy spokesman Colonel Justace Ciza said the fighting had broken out in Bubanza, 50km (30 miles) north-west of the capital, Bujumbura.  ""FNL rebels shelled mortar bombs and threw hand grenades on our different positions... but we retaliated,"" he said, Reuters news agency reports.  He also told the AFP news agency there were clashes in numerous locations around the city following a ""major attack"" by the rebels.  ""The FNL has shown they are not commmitted to peace,"" government spokesman Hafsa Mossi told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.  But an FNL spokesman said the army had started the fighting.  ""This was self-defence,"" said FNL spokesman Pasteur Habimana from Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania.  The BBC's Prime Ndikumagenge in Bujumbura says a ceasefire was agreed with the FNL in September 2006 but it has not been implemented.  Witnesses have told him they saw troops and armoured vehicles heading to the hillsides north of the capital, shortly before the shelling started late on Thursday.  Ex-rebel Pierre Nkurunziza was elected president in 2005 under a deal to end years of conflict between the Tutsi army and Hutu rebels.  More than 300,000 people died in the war sparked in 1993 by the assassination of Burundi's first Hutu head of state and democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye.     "
386,"The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has completed the move of its Halley research station.  The base is sited on the floating - and moving - Brunt Ice Shelf, and had to be relocated or face being dumped in the ocean.  Tractors were used to tow the eight modules that make up the futuristic-looking Halley 23km further ""inland"".  Last month, BAS announced it would ""mothball"" the station for the duration of the coming Antarctic winter.  The decision was made after a new crack opened in the ice shelf.  This fissure is a long way (17km) from Halley's new position but it has prompted some concern about the stability of the whole area.  Glaciologists want more time to assess the situation, and safety considerations demand staff be withdrawn before deteriorating weather conditions and 24-hour darkness make access and egress extremely difficult.  Halley's move was facilitated by its novel design.  The base has a hydraulic leg and ski system that allows it to be raised above the annual snowfall, and periodically shifted.  If these adjustments were not to happen, the station would eventually be buried and carried to the shelf edge where it would then be dropped into the ocean inside an iceberg.  Halley bases I to V were abandoned to this fate or demolished. The new design makes any adjustments easier and less labour intensive.  ""The relocation has gone really well,"" BAS director of operations Captain Tim Stockings told BBC News.  ""When you consider the big red module, which contains the general living and recreation space, weighs over 200 tonnes, I'm sure you can understand what a big exercise this is.  ""And, yes, we plan it really well, but until you see these things actually move, you're always going to be a little nervous.""  And the head of BAS, Prof Dame Jane Francis, added: ""The relocation is a terrific achievement for our operational teams. Everyone who has worked so hard is absolutely buoyant about the success of the move.""  The UK has operated a research station on the 150m-thick Brunt Ice Shelf since the late 1950s.  It has two key functions. One is as a support link to deep-field exploration of the Antarctic interior. And the second - and main task - is as a centre of research itself.  Scientists at the base have an international reputation for their studies of Earth's atmosphere.  It was at Halley, for example, that a BAS-led team was able to show in 1986 that a hole had opened in the ozone layer.  Present day work also includes investigations into ""space weather"" - the impacts that occur when particles and magnetic fields billowing away from the Sun collide with Earth's magnetic field and upper atmosphere. Solar storms are known to disrupt the operation of satellites and can even interfere with electricity grids on the ground.  Halley base and a tale of two fissures  BAS is now in the process of reorganising all this research to take account of the forthcoming shutdown.  Although automatic weather stations can continue to collect their data on solar and battery energy, pretty much all other experiments will have to be suspended.  Prof Richard Horne is head of the space weather and atmosphere team at BAS.  ""We're going to lose some of our data streams which go into our space weather forecasting model,"" he told BBC News. ""Fortunately, we've built that model in such a way that it's robust and we can still operate.  ""So, we'll continue to issue our forecasts, but it's going to make it more difficult to interpret what's going on.  ""To give you an example - just this morning we were detecting on our magnetometer at Halley two sub-storms - there's a global disruption of the Earth's magnetic field going on.  ""When the power goes off, it's going to stop that kind of monitoring.""  BAS is gradually winding down the base with the aim of having everyone out come March.  Summer-only staff who have assisted with the move are returning home onboard the Royal Research Ship Ernest Shackleton.  Of the 16 people who would ordinarily expect to over-winter at Halley, three will now work out of the UK's Rothera station on the Antarctic Peninsula instead.  Another individual will go to King Edward Point station on South Georgia.  All the others will come back to BAS HQ in Cambridge.  Halley will be re-opened in November - the start of the next summer season.  Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
387,"Face recognition technology can be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study.  Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world.  Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities.  The Carnegie Mellon team combined off-the-shelf face recognition technology with publicly-accessible Facebook profiles to identify individual students walking on campus.  In another experiment, researchers were able to extract the social security number of a student starting only with their photo.  ""When we share tagged photos of ourselves online, it becomes possible for others to link our face to our names in situations where we would normally expect anonymity,"" said team leader Professor Alessandro Acquisti.  The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen.  Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.  ""The seamless merging of online and offline data that face recognition and social media make possible raises the issue of what privacy will mean in an augmented reality world,"" Said Professor Acquisti.  The results of the research will be presented at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas this week."
388,"About 100 people were charged for calling a competition after lines had closed, chief executive Andy Duncan told a House of Commons committee.  The mistake was discovered by auditors appointed to review Channel 4's live phone-ins following recent problems.  Mr Duncan said Channel 4 was contacting the callers to arrange refunds.  The error was apparently due to a computer glitch at phone service provider Eckoh.  Mr Duncan said if competitions returned to its horse racing coverage, Channel 4 would probably use ""somebody else"" to run them.  The latest phone-in problem came as ITV denied mistakes with vote-counting on reality show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here.  The Sun newspaper claimed David Gest was wrongly evicted from last year's series after 30,000 text votes intended to save the star were not counted.  ""This accusation is completely wrong,"" an ITV statement said. ""On the night of David Gest's eviction, all votes were counted and verified.""  Eckoh, which ran the voting lines, said it was seeking legal advice over the ""maliciously fabricated"" claims.  ""Eckoh and its staff have been put under intense scrutiny in recent weeks and this cannot be allowed to continue,"" chief executive Nik Philpot said.  ""On that basis we are taking legal advice and we will be reporting the matter to the police.""  Speaking to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ITV executive chairman Michael Grade said he was ""really surprised"" at the Sun story.  Mr Grade also defended the use of interactive votes on ITV shows, and suggested viewers should develop a ""sense of humour"" over seemingly impossible questions.  One maths question on the late-night Make Your Play show proved so difficult that even an Oxford University maths professor was unable to solve it.  He added that as long as the public enjoyed phone quizzes it was ""perfectly proper to make a margin of profit"" from them.  But Mr Grade admitted programme staff had not understood the importance of complying with phone-in regulations.  ""In the excitement of a live gallery - which is a pretty fevered place on a big network show - I don't think the training and the importance of compliance has really sunk in,"" he said.  He also revealed the number of votes for Dancing on Ice had risen last week, suggesting public confidence had not been affected by the current problems.  The committee was told premium rate phone-ins were a vital part of programming.  Five chief executive Jane Lighting said telephone services were ""due to deliver about £8m"" to the channel in 2006.  ""If you look at our children's programming, our entire production cost is around £6m, so it is an important contributor to our funding,"" she said.  Icstis is currently investigating three shows: Channel 4's Richard and Judy, the BBC's Saturday Kitchen and ITV's The X Factor.  Possible regulations breaches on ITV's Soapstar Superstar, Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! are also being looked into, but no formal investigations have been launched."
389,"An internet campaign has been started to get the Stoke City anthem Delilah back into the charts.  A group of Potters fans have set up Facebook and Twitter pages to urge people to download it before their FA Cup final appearance.  Shawn Beardmore, who has been a Stoke City fan for 26 years, said: ""It's our anthem. It's the song that every other club associates with Stoke.""  The Tom Jones song reached number two in the British charts back in 1968.  ""To get in the top 10, we're going to need 15,000 downloads.  ""So if everyone who goes to the final buys it just once, that's 25,000 downloads and I would imagine that would get us top 10.  ""We just want to show the lads [players] that we are thinking of them, and we appreciate everything they've done over the last few years,"" added Mr Beardmore.  Lifelong fan Anton Booth is the supporter most closely associated with the song. Back in the 1980s, he would be held aloft on the terraces to sing the opening lines.  Football folklore suggests that the song was chosen after an away day in Derby. Mr Booth was in a pub with other Stoke City fans when police officers asked them not to sing any songs with swear words. Delilah came on the jukebox and the rest is history.  Stoke City say they have had talks in the hope Tom Jones will re-record Delilah in time for the final on 14 May.  Fans of Manchester City, who Stoke face in the FA Cup final, adopted Blue Moon as their anthem in the late 1980s. It was originally sung by Crewe Alexandra's fans."
390,"Soldiers surrounded the hotel where Gen Sarath Fonseka had stayed President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been declared the winner of Sri Lanka's presidential poll but the outcome was immediately rejected by his challenger. Gen Sarath Fonseka promised a legal challenge to the outcome of the ballot, the first since Tamil Tiger rebels were defeated after 25 years of civil war. The Elections Commission declared Mr Rajapaksa the victor with 57.8% of votes cast, to 40% for his main rival. Gen Fonseka later left a hotel where he had complained of being intimidated. He left in a vehicle with security on Wednesday, and prevented troops who had been stationed around the luxury hotel from searching him and his vehicle. The surprise challenger in this race, Gen Sarath Fonseka, alleges that there are sufficient grounds to ask the elections commissioner, Dayananda Dissanayake, to annul the outcome of this historic post-war poll. His reasons include the inability of many internally displaced Sri Lankan Tamils to cast their vote because of inadequate transport between camps and villages; and also the alleged misuse of state resources by the president's side, including the use of public funds for Mahinda Rajapaksa's campaign. Independent monitoring groups back up many of his complaints. Mr Dissanayake does, too, to some extent. But it may be difficult for the general to present a strong case for annulment. The margin of victory is much larger than many predicted, with Mr Rajapaksa getting more than six million votes, compared with something over four million for Gen Fonseka. Also, despite many election day irregularities, there were not complaints of very wide-scale chaos or vote rigging. Once he had left the area, the troops immediately took down roadblocks and dispersed. It was believed his security would be removed when he got to his house, but a military spokesman said 40-50 troops would be retained for him. A government spokesman had said the troops were at the hotel to look for army deserters, with a military spokesman adding that the troops' deployment was a ""protective measure"". The BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan, who had been in the same hotel as Gen Fonseka and other opposition leaders, says the troops' presence had created a very tense atmosphere. An opposition spokesman, Rauf Hakeem, said opposition members had appealed to the government over what he said were ""high-handed tactics"" intended to intimidate them. He told reporters there were no deserters inside the hotel. Gen Fonseka has alleged vote-rigging and has lodged several objections with Sri Lanka's electoral commission by letter. He has also accused the government of wanting to kill him and said it had removed his personal security from the hotel, leaving him vulnerable. Speaking the BBC's Sinhala service, Gen Fonseka later confirmed that he had reached his home. ""We went to the hotel because there was a threat to my life,"" he said. ""There is nothing we can do about it. There is no law and order in this country. They are planning to assassinate me."" He did not give any details about any alleged plot to kill him. He added that he was planning to leave the country, but would not say where he was going. Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the brother of the president-elect, has previously expressed concern about Gen Fonseka's allegations that at the end of the war he ordered surrendering Tamil Tiger rebels to be shot. Gotabaya Rajapaksa has denied the claims. Since he left the army the higher ranks have very much rallied behind Mr Rajapaksa, the BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says. Gen Fonseka also does not have his own party base, having stood for election backed by a disparate group of opposition parties. Independent election observers have been perturbed by two main elements, our correspondent says, one of which is the amount of violence in the run-up to the election - with most complaints about the perpetration of violence laid at the door of the president's side. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The other is what monitors say is the misuse of public resources and state media, particularly state-run TV, which provided blanket coverage of the incumbent president's campaign. Some 70% of Sri Lanka's 14 million-strong electorate turned out to vote. However, turn-out in the Tamil areas in the north-east, where the fiercest fighting occurred during the conflict, was less than 30%. Lucien Rajakarunanayake, a spokesman for Mr Rajapaksa, told the Associated Press news agency that the president had ""won a historic and resounding victory in the first free and fair elections held throughout the country since the defeat of terrorism"". Supporters of Mr Rajapaksa celebrated in the streets of Colombo, waving Sri Lankan flags and setting off fireworks. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh congratulated Mr Rajapaksa, saying he was confident ""Sri Lanka will find lasting peace, where all communities can live with dignity and in harmony."" Millions of Tamils live in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu. After a violent and acrimonious campaign, during which four people died and hundreds were wounded, Tuesday's election was largely peaceful. But there were serious exceptions, especially in the Tamil-populated north. In the city of Jaffna, the private Centre for Monitoring Election Violence said there were at least six explosions before and just after voting began. Later there were two blasts in Vavuniya, the town near the huge camps for people displaced by the war. The organisation said it feared this was a systematic attempt to scare people away from voting. There were also grenade attacks in the Sinhala-dominated centre and south. It later turned out that Gen Fonseka had not been able to vote because his name was not on the register. The two men were closely associated with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers last May but fell out soon afterwards. Gen Fonseka quit the military, complaining that he had been sidelined after the war.

391,"Controversial plans to build a mosque in Camberley have been thrown out by councillors at a heated meeting. The local Bengali Association's bid to knock down a listed building and build a domed mosque was rejected by Surrey Heath Borough Council. Local historians and residents had argued the town's heritage must be protected and opposed the plans. Abdul Mojid, who chairs the association, said they would consider whether to appeal against the decision. More than 350 people packed into Camberley Theatre in Knoll Road, with some residents queuing from 0900 GMT for a ticket. The plan involved knocking down the listed Victorian school building in London Road, which is about half a mile from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. It was originally home to Yorktown Infants and Primary schools, before later becoming St Gregory's Roman Catholic school. When the school closed, the building was sold to the Berkshire, Hampshire & Surrey Bengali Welfare Association (BWA) which has been using it as an Islamic centre since 1996. The association argued that the building no longer met the needs of the growing local Muslim community, and people wanted to worship in a mosque and not in a school. The plans had been approved by the council's planning committee earlier this year, but overturned on a technicality. The school building has been used as an Islamic centre since 1996 Nahrni Choudhury, who spoke at the meeting on behalf of the BWA, accused some of the campaigners of racism. Speaking after the meeting, she said: ""I am upset. It's not just about what the buildings will be. ""It's about the fact that we are Muslims and we are an ethnic minority and they don't want to see a mosque here."" Conservative council leader Moira Gibson admitted there were ""a few racist elements"" but said said she did not think the campaign was fuelled by Islamophobia. Please turn on JavaScript.

392,"   Read my answers to your questions Football is a fantastic game but one of the things that attracts controversy is players diving. This week the Torquay chairman Chris Roberts announced an initiative to punish his players for diving - even going as far as sacking them for a third offence. Over the last few years a lot of stuff that players thrive on have been taken out of the game    If it works then fair enough but it seems drastic to be fining players - to go as far as sacking them for diving would be unbelievable. I think this is a problem that can be sorted out by players having a stern word with their team-mates. We have had instances at our place where a few of the lads have done it. What happens is they end up getting stick for it in training and that seems to put a stop to it - they do not want to be embarrassed by the attention they get through the week. The gaffer Sam Allardyce has talked about it and I think it is something that all the managers have got together and said they want to stamp out. It is something that has been going on for a while. Even though football is quite physical, over the last few years a lot of stuff that players thrive on have been taken out of the game - like the tackle from behind. There used to be players who would spend all game booting people and the fans loved them. Now those players have virtually gone from the game. People sometimes compare the behaviour of rugby players and footballers - but the games are totally different. The other week I was watching the Australia v Great Britain rugby league game and a player punched an opponent and then 10 minutes later hit the scrum-half. It was unbelievable but he only got a one-game ban. If that was a footballer he would be looking at a three-month suspension at least. The diving situation is a difficult one - but what can we do about it? I'm sure plenty of people have looked at the problem and it is not happening so maybe it is one of those things. Without all these controversies we would not have pundits and people analysing the game. These people have so much to talk about they have made a living out of it. I think people actually like all the controversies in the game. So do we really want to do anything about it? I do not think you will be seeing many Torquay players diving now if they face the sack so if it works then good luck to them. Jasmine Elizabeth Nolan is absolutely gorgeous - I am so proud to be a father    But if that happened at Bolton I do not think too many of the players would be happy. It would go to a vote between me and the other players to see if we can come to an agreement. I am captain so when things happen we have a group of about four players and we get together and chat about it. Personally I do not think I would back it - even though I am not a diver and do not condone diving. I would much rather sort out the problem another way. Last week I missed the game at Everton to attend the birth of my daughter Jasmine Elizabeth Nolan. The contractions started late on Thursday night and continued through Friday. Fortunately one of our friends Julie is a midwife so she looked after my fiancee Hayley while I went to training. It was on my mind throughout the weekend - in fact it has been on my mind for the last nine months. We went to the hospital at 4am on Saturday and it was not until 1.58pm that Jasmine arrived. It was an unbelievable experience which is impossible to explain unless you have children yourself. She is absolutely gorgeous - I am so proud to be a father and so proud of Hayley. It was really sad seeing her in so much pain during the birth and not being able to do anything for her. But she has been superb throughout the pregnancy and even six hours later she was talking about doing it again. On the Friday I had taken part in our team-play in training and the plan was to leave it until the last minute to make a decision on whether to play. Normally we meet up as a squad on Saturday morning but the gaffer gave me special dispensation to meet at Everton as it was only 15 minutes from where I live. If the baby had come at 1pm I could have popped over, stuck my boots on and had a go. I was a bit upset to miss the game but I would not have changed it for the world - it was well worth it. I do not think I could have left her so soon after the birth. All my Evertonian friends have been saying she is a true blue because she made me miss the game! Nothing I have done in my career - getting promoted to the Premiership, playing in Europe or scoring a goal - can even compare to such a fantastic experience. I went back to training on Tuesday and life is now getting back to normal - it is just that I have got another little life to look after now. It has been great going to work with a smile on my face and coming home to her is brilliant - even seeing her cry makes me happy. I am just looking forward to Jasmine meeting all my team-mates - maybe if Hayley will let me we can get her a Bolton strip for when I go down and show her off. I would just like to say a special thanks to Julie for looking after us and Hayley's mum Christine who was great as well. Hi Kevin. I am a Liverpool fan but I have seen you play a few times now and think you are a great player. I was wondering though, out of the players you have played with and against in the Premiership, what would your dream five-a-side team be?   Mark Weir,  Wales In goal I would have Jussi Jaaskelainen then probably Steven Gerrard, Thierry Henry, John Terry and Wayne Rooney. I would put myself on the bench and be the captain - shouting at them from the sides. What main factor in the whole game of football would you like to see stamped out to help the future of the game?    Gary, Bristol I think the rule when a player gets injured and has to wait at the side of the pitch to come back on is ridiculous. I'd rather he just came back on and we get on with the game with 11 versus 11. Hi Kevin. Great column mate! Just a quick question really. It's kind of stupid but its been bugging me for quite a while! Do players wear a brand new kit every game? If not how long before a new one is issued and what happens to the old ones? Best of luck for the rest of the season!    Steve Kerwood, UK Generally we get a kit every 6-8 games but it depends. A lot of players swap it every week, some don't. I tend to give away between 10-20 shirts a year to players and then some to friends and family. All the shirts, shorts and socks that don't get used get given to us at the end of the season to give out so I pass them on to local charities. Although my dad and brother normally pinch one each - I think they mainly use them as pyjamas. Hi Kevin. I read on BBC Sport that Sam Allardyce took advantage of the international break and took the rest of the squad to see a Celine Dion concert in Las Vegas. Was this seen as a nice treat or a punishment for the rest of the players to try harder to make the international squads in future?!    Andy Montgomery, England He took his wife to see Celine Dion and Shirley Bassey as a present - we were back at home training hard unfortunately. But I saw Celine Dion over there a few years back and she was terrific. I would definitely recommend seeing her if you go over there. Hi Kev. Firstly good luck with your new arrival (say goodbye to your sleep). Just a quick question, when players have a fitness test just before a game what does this consist of exactly?    JASON GLOVER, ENGLAND There is a lot of twisting and turning and a lot of sprint work. It normally starts slowly with some jogging and then goes into sprinting and then some ball-striking with the inside of the foot. I've been very lucky in that I've not had many injuries and not had to do any fitness tests, so the only information I've got is from watching others doing it - so touch wood it will never happen. All right Kevin. Good column and hope everything goes well with the kiddo. I was hoping you could answer a question regarding training. What sort of stamina is expected at your level? Are you up near the 20 mark in the beep test? Been wanting to know that for a long time! Cheers, all the best    James K, Australia I've never done the beep test but we have a thing at Bolton called the premier endurance test that our fitness department and the manager came up with. It's what is expected during a Premier League game and consists of lots of sprints, three-quarter runs and stuff like that. I think it works as over the last five years we have become quite a fit club. I'm generally one of the fittest, along with Gary Speed, who is still very fit, and Kevin Davies. But most of the lads are as fitness stats are vital when the gaffer signs a player. Kevin will continue to answer a selection of your questions each week throughout the season.

393,"Changing priorities has seen BP move its focus away from its green branding    Environmental groups have accused BP of dropping its pledge to be green and replacing it with a commitment to be ""responsible"". The oil giant was widely recognised as the first oil company to both acknowledge and tackle climate change. Also, its in-house carbon trading scheme - built with a little help from an unlikely ally, the US-based Environmental Defense Fund - was among the first of its kind. However, a change of chief executive has led to an apparent change of policy. In April, CEO Tony Hayward announced that safety was the company's ""number one priority"". Some environmental groups saw this as an attempt to move away from ""green"" as a brand value, which was introduced by Mr Hayward's predecessor, Lord Browne. Greenpeace said the oil giant had a lot to gain by dropping its promise to be green. Charlie Kronick, Greenpeace's senior climate change adviser, suggested that the pledge was the only thing holding it back from making further cuts to its green credentials. ""Now that BP is blissfully released from its pledge to invest in clean energy, it has a carte blanche to sell off its unprofitable green energy arm,"" he told the BBC. ""It can get back to doing what it does best: being a 100% fossil fuels train wreck,"" Mr Kronick added. ""This is classic smoke and mirrors."" BP denies that it is back-tracking on its commitments to climate change. ""The change represents an evolution and expansion of green as a brand value rather than a replacement,"" said spokesman David Nicholas. ""The new brand value, 'Responsible', encompasses BP's original aspirations towards the environment, in addition to other key areas such as safety and social welfare,"" he explained. ""Our aspirations remain absolutely unchanged: no accidents, no harm to people and no damage to the environment."" Tom Woollard, a director at environmental consultancy ERM, which counts BP as one of its clients, is inclined to agree. Lord Browne re-positioned BP as an energy, not petroleum, company ""I don't think BP has taken a step backwards on being green,"" he told the BBC. ""The people I know who work at BP are still as committed as ever to upholding green values, despite the change."" However, BP's low-key roll-out of the new brand values does mark the end of an era. Lord Browne's re-branding in 2000 promised that the company would move ""Beyond Petroleum"" by finding cleaner ways to generate energy, and listed ""performance-driven, innovative, progressive and green"" as its brand attributes. Britain's green energy sector flourished, as Lord Browne's shining for solar power went head-to-head with rival oil giant Shell's investment in wind projects. Both oil titans lavished huge quantities of money on slick green advertising campaigns. But Rita Clifton, chief executive of brand specialists Interbrand, said high-profile promotions could be a double-edged sword. ""You can't promise in an advert what you aren't delivering on a day-to-day basis and not expect a backlash,"" she told the BBC. The company focused its attention on solar energy And the backlash was fierce: campaigners demanded to know what exactly was green about being responsible for a massive oil spill on Alaska's North Slope""; investing in the extraction of oil from tar sands (described by campaigners as ""global warming's greatest crime""), and spending less than 1.5% of its budget on solar power. BP's environmental credentials suffered a further setback in 2008 when the company announced its intention of withdrawing financial support for a scheme that monitored mangroves next to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant it was constructing in Papua, South-East Asia. ""Withdrawal of BP's support for the monitoring process goes against all the green rhetoric that is so prominent in BP's public relations and marketing exercises,"" campaigners at TAPOL, Down to Earth and a number of other human rights organisations wrote in a letter to BP CEO Tony Hayward. Paul Barber, a TAPOL spokesperson, says that BP has also broken its promise to reinject the carbon dioxide which will escape into the atmosphere from the gas field. ""About 12% of the gas field is carbon dioxide, which will now be vented directly into the atmosphere because BP has backtracked on its promise to institute carbon capture and storage at the Tangguh gas field,"" Mr Barber told BBC News. BP's tone changed in 2008 when Tony Hayward, who replaced Lord Browne in 2007, intimated that he was looking to ""monetise BP's Alternative Energy Business"". The company was unlikely to appease its fiercest critics And BP recently pulled clean out of Britain's green energy sector, cutting investment in renewable energy by 30%, and cutting its solar power workforce by a quarter. Time for a new look then? And if so, what? BP has rebranded itself as ""responsible"" in order to regain the trust it lost following the 2005 Texas City explosion, which killed 15 people and injured more than 170 others. The incident was described as ""one of the worst industrial accidents in the history of the US"" by ERM's Tom Woollard. It led to a record fine of more than $21m by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It also resulted to BP picking up the nickname ""Big Problems"", and the episode ""seriously shook BP's bond of trust with investors"", says Rita Clifton. Tony Hayward has worked hard to regain the public's trust by improving the safety of BP's operations. In April, he announced that safety was the firm's ""number one priority"". ""A new brand value is BP's way of saying that safety is now a top priority,"" Mr Woollard explained. ""It's a promise to potential partners that another Texas City is not on the cards,"" he added. It would be easy to jeer at BP for casting off what many have always considered to be a half-heartedly green mantle. But is it any wonder that BP is reverting to its old habits, given the scepticism with which campaigners greet the green shoots of green thinking in the senior management of oil companies? When confronted with the prospect of sneering green groups, it could well be that any oil company toying with the idea of experimenting with green initiatives - beyond the near term interests of their shareholders - will think twice. And anyway, as Lord Browne outlined in a recent speech at Cardiff University, perhaps saving the world should not be left to the oil companies. If the world could not incentivise green behaviours using good ol' capitalism, Lord Browne noted, it had to be accomplished via legislation, if it can be done at all.     "
394,"Former chancellor George Osborne says he is quitting the House of Commons ""for now"".  The Conservative MP for Tatton said he was ""very excited"" about becoming the new editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper.  He told his local Tory party he would be using the role to provide ""straight facts and informed opinion"" through the paper's general election coverage.  MPs have backed Theresa May's call for a snap election on 8 June.  Mr Osborne told the BBC's John Pienaar he would be fighting for the same values he had as chancellor and an MP of 16 years standing.  But as Evening Standard editor he would also ""speak for London, speak for my readers and speak for this country and its future"".  ""Our country has got some big decisions to make now about the kind of Britain we want to be and those values of openness, tolerance and enterprise are ones I hold dear,"" he said.  Asked if he believed Mrs May understood the concerns of people who voted for Britain to remain in the EU, he said: ""We have got to make sure that not just London's voice is heard, but the voice of a Britain that wants to play a big role on the world stage, that celebrates the fact we have a diverse society, that is optimistic about the future, not afraid about the future - those are things I have always believed in.""  Earlier, in a letter confirming he would not be seeking re-election, Mr Osborne said: ""It's still too early to be writing my memoirs.""  At the age of 45, he did not to spend the rest of his life ""just being an ex-chancellor"", he said. ""I want new challenges. I'm very excited about the opportunity to edit the Evening Standard.""  He added: ""More so than at any time in my life, the public need from the media the straight facts and informed opinion to help them to make the big decisions Britain now faces about the country we want to be.  ""That starts with the coverage of this general election.""  Following last month's announcement that Mr Osborne would be taking over as editor of the London-based free newspaper from Sarah Sands, questions had been asked about how he would combine that role with being an MP for a northern constituency.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the appointment as a ""joke"" and called for an immediate by-election in Tatton.  ""The appointment makes a mockery of the independence of the media,"" he said at the time. ""It takes multi-tasking to a new level and is an insult to the electors he is supposed to serve.""  But Mr Osborne defended himself, adding that he believed having MPs who could draw on outside experiences was good for Parliament as it enabled former ministers, in particular, to ""continuing to contribute to the decisions we make"".  Mr Osborne, who was chancellor for six years, had ambitions to be a journalist as a young man.  He failed to get a place on The Times' trainee scheme after graduating from Oxford University - at which he edited its Isis magazine - and was briefly a freelance reporter on the Daily Telegraph's diary column.  Since being axed as chancellor by Theresa May when she became PM last July, Mr Osborne has picked up a number of other jobs."
395,"A Wirral wildlife haven will be without a live-in custodian as Wirral Council say they have had difficulty finding a ranger prepared to live without mains electricity or running water on Hilbre Island.  Councillor David Elderton, Wirral Council cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism, said ""We are finding it very difficult finding someone who will live there, cut off from the mainland half the time.""  Hilbre Island, off the coast of west Wirral near to West Kirkby is part of the Dee Estuary and home to seals, oystercatchers. The island is a Grade I Site of Special Scientific Interest.  While there will no longer be a permanent human presence on the island Joe Hanik from the Wirral Ranger Service says there will still be regular visits by rangers, ""We've got a team of rangers that can come out here.  ""Not necessarily just to respond but to come out here more regularly."""
396,"Shortly after HMS Bulwark arrived in Limassol, Foreign Office minister Lord Triesman visited the vessel to thank the crew for their hard work.  He said the passengers finally felt safe after having been through ""a hell of a trauma"".  The evacuees will fly back to the UK from RAF Akrotiri later, joining the hundreds who have already returned.  The violence was sparked last week when Hezbollah militants captured two Israeli soldiers.  The UK has refused to back calls from the United Nations for an immediate ceasefire.  Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett told the BBC that a more durable and long-term solution needed to be found.  And she denied claims that intervention by the US could stop the bloodshed.  ""The people who have the answer to a stop of violence, now this minute, in their hands, are the people who hold those kidnapped Israeli soldiers,"" she said.  Anti-war protesters are planning 11 demonstrations in cities around the UK this weekend to register their opposition to Israel's actions in Lebanon.  Meanwhile, local authorities are preparing for the return of the evacuees, with various council teams prepared to meet them at a reception centre in Gatwick Airport.  Ministers have confirmed that dual nationals will have the same entitlements as British citizens when they arrive in the country.  And the prime minister's spokesman praised the ""magnificent efforts"" of the Royal Navy in evacuating 3,000 people so far.  Evacuated Britons on HMS Bulwark were joined by several hundred foreign nationals.  The boredom of their 12-hour journey was relieved by screenings of Harry Potter films in the officers' quarters and handouts of sweets.  Captain Clive Johnstone said the passage had gone ""excellently"".  ""It has been quite fun, the crew have got the immediate interaction with the passengers and hopefully people will have had a good experience.""  Among those who tried to board the ships was radical preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed, who was banned from Britain last year.  He said he had been turned back by officials because he did not have a British passport.  Friday's rescue efforts came a day after HMS York transported hundreds of people from the country.  Others who were trapped in the southern port of Tyre, which has been hit by Israeli air-strikes, were being evacuated on a UN-chartered ferry.  Some 687 British nationals have already returned to Britain after being rescued from Lebanon.  Angela Quartermaine, a 23-year-old student from Macclesfield in Cheshire, was among 60 evacuees who touched down at Manchester Airport early on Friday and said her experience had been ""surreal"".  ""I never thought I would want to get back to Beirut, but now my life has changed,"" she said.  Trudy Hindi, a 41-year-old mother of three, was also evacuated to Cyprus and is waiting to return to her home in Bridgend, south Wales.  She said bombs had landed close to where she and her daughters were staying which was ""pretty frightening"".  She said she was glad to leave, but that leaving her frail parents-in-law in Lebanon had been ""really hard"".  More than 330 Lebanese people and 34 Israelis have died in fighting in the past ten days. Most of the fatalities have been civilians.  The UK Foreign Office can be contacted on 020 7008 1500, or the embassy in Beirut on +961 1 990400."
397,"But a leading feminist campaigner claims that sex reassignment surgery is based on unscientific ideas - and could be doing more harm than good.  ""I should never have had sex change surgery,"" Claudia MacLean, a transsexual woman told the audience at a recent debate organised by the BBC Radio 4 programme Hecklers and the Royal Society of Medicine in London.  ""As a result of the surgery, I am incapable of sex and I have lived a life apart.""  Claudia was speaking out in support of Julie Bindel, a radical feminist and journalist, who was trying to persuade medics and trans people that sex change surgery is unnecessary mutilation.  To them, the claim that someone can be ""born into the wrong sex"" is a deeply threatening concept.  Many feminists believe that the behaviours and feelings which are considered typically masculine or typically feminine are purely socially conditioned.  But if, as some in the transsexual lobby believes, the tendency to feel masculine or feminine is something innate then it follows that gender stereotypical behaviours could well be ""natural"" rather than as the result of social pressures and male oppression.  As a feminist, Julie Bindel therefore has a strong political motivation for her scepticism about sex change surgery.  But, her argument goes beyond ideology.  Having looked into the medical research on transsexualism, she claims there is a lack of science behind the diagnosis, no satisfactory research into the outcomes for patients and individual stories of post-operative regret.  Claudia says she was referred for surgery after a single 45 minute consultation.  ""At no time did I say to that psychiatrist that I felt like a woman. In my opinion what happened to me was all about money.""  She is one of a small number of trans people who have publicly expressed their regrets about having had sex change surgery.  Another is Charles Kane who, as Sam Hashimi, was the subject of a BBC documentary One Life: Make me a Man Again, televised in 2004.  This showed Sam, a transsexual woman, undergoing surgery to become a man again.  She told the BBC that her desire to become a woman had developed following a nervous breakdown.  For her, these feelings were caused by a longing to retreat into a fantasy character rather than having a crisis of gender identity.  ""When I was in the psychiatric hospital there was a man on one side of me who thought he was King George and another guy on the other side who thought he was Jesus Christ. I decided I was Sam.""  Others, like Miranda Ponsonby, blame post-operative discontent on society's lack of willingness to accept transsexual people.  In her forthcoming autobiography, The Making of Miranda, she describes having a strong sense from a young age that she was a female trapped in a man's body.  However, like Claudia, she says that, since her surgery, she has lived a life apart.  She claims that she is no happier now than she was before the operation.  Her advice to those contemplating sex change surgery is ""Don't do it.""  Against these stories of disappointment and regret, there are many more people who will testify publicly to their overwhelming satisfaction with sex change surgery.  But are most people who have sex change surgery satisfied or dissatisfied?  It comes as something of a surprise to learn that the medical profession does not yet know the answer to this question.  According to a review carried out by the School of Health and Related Research at Sheffield University, the poor quality of research in this area means that ""little robust evidence exists"" on the outcomes for patients who have sex change surgery.  Dr Kevan Wylie, a consultant in sexual medicine and the head of the UK body looking into standards of care for sex change surgery patients, admits there have been difficulties.  ""The problem is that we tend to lose touch with our patients after a relatively short period of time following surgery.""  Some local health authorities now refuse to fund sex change operations on the basis that there is a lack of evidence about the surgical efficacy and psychological benefits of surgery.  In the absence of more research studies, gender dysphoria specialist Dr Kevan Wylie says it is important to listen to his patients.  However, those contemplating surgery - and the health authorities which fund them - ought also to be able to get advice about the risks versus the potential benefits of such a major operation and, until further research is done, doctors are unable to give them such information.

398,"The BBC has confirmed children's show Blue Peter broke guidelines in a vote to name its cat, as it revealed three other breaches of editorial rules. The cat was called Socks after staff changed the results of an online poll. Viewers wanted the cat named Cookie. BBC 6 Music's head of programmes Ric Blaxill has resigned after two further instances of fictional competition winners on his station were revealed. Another rule breach concerned a film show on the Asian Network. The BBC said a number of disciplinary proceedings had been undertaken. No further details were given for Mr Blaxill's departure from 6 Music, where fictional winners were announced on shows presented by Clare McDonnell and Tom Robinson in September 2006. The BBC said it had uncovered four new breaches of guidelines More revelations to come The BBC said neither DJ had been aware of the deception. The BBC's latest admissions came on 20 September, two days after it emerged that a producer at 6 Music had been sacked after staff on the Liz Kershaw show posed as competition winners on ""live"" shows which had actually been pre-recorded. Media union Bectu said she would be appealing against the decision. The BBC also said an audience vote for award winners on the Asian Network's Film Cafe in February 2007 had been overruled by a member of the production team, once as a result of an error in reading results, and another time because a genuine winner was unavailable for interview. An apology will be broadcast to Blue Peter viewers when the show's new series begins on Tuesday. Socks will be joined on the programme by a new kitten, Cookie, to reflect the results of the original audience vote in January 2006. Director general Mark Thompson said: ""I would like to repeat my apology to viewers and listeners who were misled by these editorial lapses. ""Although these lapses amount to tens of hours across one million hours of broadcasting, the BBC's standards must be as high in small-scale competitions as they are in the most major news story."" A review of contracts had begun to ensure staff understood their responsibility for upholding editorial standards. ""A phased and controlled return"" of competitions to the corporation's output is expected to begin in November. Former BBC executive Will Wyatt's independent inquiry into the controversy surrounding a forthcoming documentary about the Queen will report in October, with the details to be made public. All 16,500 BBC production staff will undergo what the corporation called an ""unprecedented programme of editorial training"" called Safeguarding Trust. The training materials will be made available to other broadcasters and producers. A major new online project to help the public understand how media content is produced has been commissioned by Mr Thompson. ""The BBC believes this will be a major contribution to media literacy in Britain,"" it said. Mr Thompson presented these proposals to the corporation's governing body, the BBC Trust, on Wednesday. In a statement, the Trust said the breaches suggested that, in certain parts of the organisation, a culture had developed where knowledge of and adherence to the BBC's editorial guidelines was inadequate. ""The Trust is clear that these cases arose not because of an individual's desire for personal gain, but because of some programme-makers' misguided belief that those decisions... were more important than honesty and fairness to the audience,"" it said. ""Had the BBC editorial guidelines already been complied with, none of these breaches would have occurred."""
399,"The Premiership club said on Friday that Mr Glazer held 8 million of the club's shares, about 3.17% of the total.  Under UK stock market rules, investors whose holdings in a firm rise above a 3% threshold are obliged to inform its management.  Mr Glazer, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team, has been linked with persistent speculation of an effort to take over Manchester United.  The club, owner of one of the most well-known global sporting brands, is thought to be in the sights of a number of potential buyers.  There were rumours earlier this year that Mr Glazer was weighing up a bid for the club, possibly in conjuction with three other Man Utd shareholders - Irish horseracing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus, and Dutch television entrepreneur John de Mol.  More recent takeover speculation has centred on an unidentified Russian billionaire and a Middle Eastern businessman, also unnamed.  Rumours of a foreign buyout have gathered pace following the surprise takeover of Manchester United's premiership rivals Chelsea by Russian oil billionaire Roman Abramovich.  However, Manchester United would not come cheap, with an estimated price tag of about £600m ($960m).  Manchester United shares were down 2.5p at 193p in mid-morning trade on Friday."
400,"The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reached a deal to form a coalition government, officials say.  His Likud-Yisrael Beitenu party list will form a coalition with the centrist Yesh Atid and Hatnua and the far-right Jewish Home.  Mr Netanyahu was forced to give up his alliance with the ultra-Orthodox parties: Shas and United Torah Judaism.  It took five weeks to reach deals with his new partners after the general election on 22 January.  ""There is a government,"" Likud spokeswoman Noga Katz was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.  On his Facebook page, Yair Lapid, the leader of Yesh Atid, says the coalition agreement will be signed ""probably tonight"".  Talks on the size and shape of the cabinet went on late into Wednesday night between Likud and its two main coalition partners, Yesh Atid and Jewish Home.  Apart from the prime minister, there will be 21 ministers, making it the smallest government in decades, Israeli media report. Yesh Atid is expected to be responsible for finance and education and Likud will run the interior ministry.  Once the deal is signed, it will have to be approved by the Israeli parliament or Knesset and sworn in.  Adding to the time pressure is a visit by the United States President Barack Obama scheduled to begin on 20 March.  It will be his first trip to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan since being elected president in 2008.  Yesh Atid has secured five ministerial portfolios, while Jewish Home parties will have three, reports say.  Likud and Yisrael Beitenu, which formed an alliance ahead of the vote, saw their position in the Knesset weakened by the vote.  They lost a quarter of their 42 seats, leaving them with 31 out of 120.  Yesh Atid took 19 seats and Jewish Home, led by Naftali Bennett, finished in fourth place with 12.  The two men formed a pact in coalition talks and got commitments to a new draft law that will compel more ultra-Orthodox men to perform national military service or other civilian duties.  Sharing the ""social burden"", as it is known, was a hot political issue in the last election.  Many secular Israelis object to the exemptions from army service given to students at religious seminaries or yeshivas and the large state subsidies that their institutions receive.  In the new cabinet, it is believed Mr Lapid - a former TV presenter - will be finance minister and Mr Bennett, a high-tech millionaire, will be economic and trade minister.  After tough negotiations it was apparently decided that Mr Lapid's deputy, Rabbi Shai Piron would take the education portfolio while Likud would have the interior ministry.  Mr Netanyahu is expected to act as foreign minister while Avigdor Lieberman, who leads his partner Yisrael Beitenu, faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in a trial.  The defence ministry will be headed by former IDF chief of staff, Moshe Yaalon, a member of Likud.  Tzipi Livni, whose Hatnua party holds six seats, will be justice minister and chief negotiator in talks with the Palestinians.  The opposition will consist of Labour, the third biggest party in the parliament with 15 seats, the ultra-Orthodox and Arab parties and centrist Kadima.  One of the first challenges for the new government will be passing the 2013 budget which will include austerity measures. Mr Netanyahu called for an early election last October because he said that bickering among his coalition partners made it impossible to pass a ""responsible budget"".  Talks with Mr Obama next week are expected to focus on Iran's nuclear weapons programme, the war in neighbouring Syria and efforts to revive peace talks with the Palestinians."
401,"Cracks in a dam just north of the Korean border have sparked fears that it could collapse and send millions of tonnes of waters crashing into the South.  The 16-year-old dam, near Mount Kumgang in the south-eastern corner of North Korea, lies on a northern tributary of the Han River which flows across South Korea and through the capital Seoul.  The security alert comes just four weeks before South Korea is due to host the World Cup.  ""Imnam Dam was found to have a damaged part, 20 metres (66 feet) wide and 15 metres (50 feet) deep, on the upper side,"" South Korea's Construction Ministry said in a statement.  In recent days, South Korea's media have released satellite photographs of the cracks.  The ministry said the North's dam was ""probably having troubles in safety"" and was ""seen to be unable to control floods"" in the rainy seasons.  The main risk will be during the rainy season in July.  ""If precipitation reaches between 300 mm and 500 mm (12 and 20 inches) during the rainy season, it may cause the worst case scenario, although the possibility is slim,"" Assistant Construction Minister Park Dong-wha told reporters.  The South Korean Government said it would take the precaution of emptying dams on its side of the border, and will clad the slopes of one of them with cement to withstand any massive flows of water from the North.  The government plans to raise the issue at inter-Korean economic talks to open in Seoul next week."
402,"More than 60 football fans in Rio de Janeiro have been injured, two seriously, after a fence collapsed during the final of Brazil's Joao Havelange Cup. The crush took place after hundreds of fans in the upper terraces of the Sao Januario stadium pressed forward, apparently trying to flee fighting that had broken out between rival supporters.    After the fight began, everybody fell on top of each other, then the whole terrace panicked    Fans lower down were pushed against the perimeter fence, which collapsed under their weight. Hundreds of people spilled onto the pitch. The accident occurred in the 21st minute of the game between Vasco da Gama and Sao Caetano, with the score at 0-0. Play was held up and then abandoned 90 minutes later. Officials at a nearby hospital said more than 50 people, including small children, had been brought in with injuries ranging from bruises to broken arms. ""Nobody has died, many people have been discharged, at least two are seriously hurt, though not critically,"" hospital director Maria Emilia Amaral said, adding that the number of injured could reach 70. Television footage after the incident showed dozens of spectators lying on the pitch, while others wandered around in a state of shock. ""After the fight began, everybody fell on top of each other, then the whole terrace panicked,"" one supporter told the Reuters news agency. Many of the wounded were treated at the scene by ambulance staff, while helicopters took those with more serious injuries to a hospital in Rio.    The governor, who is a weak-willed incompetent man, decided to have the match abandoned    The order to abandon the game - the showpiece of the Brazilian football season - came from the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Anthony Garotinho. He overruled police and club officials who had wanted to carry on. Mr Miranda was quoted by the French news agency AFP as saying that Mr Garotinho had no right to stop the game. ""The military police chiefs were prepared to encircle the pitch so none of the fans could interrupt the match restarting,"" he was quoted as saying. ""However, the governor, who is a weak-willed incompetent man, decided to have the match abandoned."" Vasco authorities are reported to have later declared themselves champions. The choice of the 35,000-capacity Sao Januario over the much larger Maracana stadium had been widely criticised before the game. Sao Caetano vice-president Jose Carlos Molina said his team had wanted the match stopped. ""There has been a tragedy here. We can't go on,"" he said. ""The players are in no state of mind to continue."""
403,"This is about a quarter of the figure given in a disputed Lancet article, but nearly three times higher than that of the Iraq Body Count campaigning group.  The result is based on interviews with over 9,000 families across Iraq carried out by the health ministry for the WHO.  The survey says more than half of all violent deaths were in Baghdad.  The World Health Organization study looks only at the period from March 2003 until June 2006.  Researchers interviewed households right across Iraq, in towns and the countryside, and asked the head of each one for details of all deaths in the group.  They say violence became a leading cause of death of Iraqi adults; among men between 15 and 59 it was the main cause of death.  The survey authors say they are confident in the general level of accuracy of the answers they received because they had a high response rate, and because the answers from other questions in their survey were consistent with information they already had.  Despite the large number of families interviewed, the authors do not say 151,000 is a precise figure.  Instead, they offer a range of between 104,000 and 223,000.  ""Assessment of the death toll in conflict situations is extremely difficult and household survey results have to be interpreted with caution,"" said study co-author Mohamed Ali, a WHO statistician.  ""However, in the absence of comprehensive death registration and hospital reporting, household surveys are the best we can do.""  ""The survey results indicate a massive death toll since the beginning of the conflict,"" said Iraqi health minister Salih Motlab al-Hasanawi.  The level of civilian casualties in Iraq has been a controversial issue ever since the US-led invasion of 2003.  The US does not give estimates of civilian deaths, although President George W Bush once gave a figure of 30,000.  In October 2006, the Lancet published a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It suggested that between about 655,000 more Iraqis had died since the invasion than would normally have been expected.  Its researchers spoke to more than 1,800 families comprising 12,800 people, comparing mortality rates in selected areas before and after the invasion.  It covered a similar period to the latest survey, but was undermined by allegations that the number of people surveyed was too small and that the authors may have inflated the figures for political reasons.  Mr Bush himself criticised its methodology as ""pretty well discredited"", and its figure as ""not credible"".  The best-known casualty tracker is the independent Iraq Body Count. It says it prefers to err on the side of caution, counting only confirmed deaths. The toll it gave for up to June 2006 was under 50,000.  It now gives a range of 80,381 - 87,792.  The BBC's Humphrey Hawkesley, reporting from Baghdad, says violence has fallen in recent months, put down to the success of the US's injection of extra troops.  But he says Iraq remains a very dangerous place.  The latest study's findings are published on the website of the New England Journal of Medicine."

But after the Revenue chose not to pursue the matter, music tycoon Winkelman's group is set to buy the club before the target date of 31 July.  That was the deadline set by the League to do the deal, or risk seeing the Milton Keynes-based club expelled.

405,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A junior member of the government has been sacked after breaking ranks to call for a challenge to Prime Minister Gordon Brown as Labour leader. Assistant whip Siobhain McDonagh said she wanted a debate about the party's future and a ""huge number"" of other Labour MPs also wanted a contest. A government spokesman said she had always been ""anti-Gordon"" but the Tories said Labour was in ""civil war"". She has been replaced in the whips office by Brent South MP Dawn Butler. Ms McDonagh - who was the only member of the government not to nominate Mr Brown for the party leadership last year - said she wanted a debate about the future of the party and the country. The Mitcham and Morden MP said ""everybody"" in government was talking about the leadership issue and she wanted such discussions to be out in the open. ""It's about time we let party members and people involved in the Labour Party and the wider community in on that debate,"" she told the BBC News Channel. I think Gordon Brown is a really good man who has the best of intentions - I just think that being prime minster is a shockingly hard job    ""I think we need to clear the air. I think whoever wants to stand for leader of the Labour Party should do so and we should have a good debate about the direction of the party and the government."" She insisted that she did not have a particular candidate in mind. But she told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that ""a huge number of Labour MPs want a leadership election"". She refused to say whether she would back Gordon Brown or another candidate in a contest. Asked if Mr Brown had done a good job since taking over, she said: ""I think Gordon Brown is a really good man who has the best of intentions. I just think that being prime minster is a shockingly hard job."" The Labour Party is quite clearly degenerating into a state of civil war    Asked whether she felt he was ""shockingly bad"" at it, she said not. Ms McDonagh is so far the only member of the government to call publicly for a leadership contest. She added: ""If I could have found an easier way, or a quieter way, to do this then I would have done it. ""But everyone's saying, 'You first.' I didn't want to be in a position where I'd look back in five years' time and think I could have done the right thing but didn't do it."" She is among a small group of Labour MPs to have sought details about the nomination process for a contest. She told PM she had written to Labour's general secretary in confidence to ask for nomination papers but had been forced to go public with her concerns after being contacted by a journalist. Labour confirmed the party had received letters from a ""small number"" of MPs asking why no nomination papers for leader were issued ahead of the party conference. It would take 70 MPs to trigger a potential leadership contest. Labour MP Emily Thornberry mounted a defence of Mr Brown's premiership on PM, saying the public would not ""respect"" Ms McDonagh for her call. And the reason no alternative candidate had come forward to challenge Mr Brown was that he was ""best qualified"" to steer the country through difficult economic times, she said. But Chris Grayling, for the Conservatives, said: ""The Labour Party is quite clearly degenerating into a state of civil war. ""For a prime minister to have one of his own whips calling for a leadership contest is unprecedented. ""At a time when Britain faces massive economic challenges it is profoundly damaging to have a government in such disarray. We need an early election to get the change Britain so desperately needs."" In a separate development, 12 backbench Labour MPs, including six former ministers, have urged the leadership to develop ""a convincing new narrative"" which has to be more than ""a series of policy initiatives"" in order to restore Labour's fortunes. In a joint article for New Labour magazine Progress, they say Labour has ""no explanation yet"" as to how it will ""steer the economy through the troubled waters ahead"". And they claim that ""one-off taxes and pay-outs, no matter how justified in their own terms, do not amount to a strategy"", adding there is a ""yawning chasm"" which the Labour party needs to fill or the government will suffer a ""hammer blow"". The piece is signed by Janet Anderson, Karen Buck, Patricia Hewitt, George Howarth, Eric Joyce, Sally Keeble, Stephen Ladyman, Martin Linton, Shona McIsaac, Margaret Moran, Tom Levitt, and Paddy Tipping. Progress insists the article it is not linked to Ms McDonagh's call for a leadership contest but it will add to pressure on Gordon Brown ahead of Labour's conference later this month.     "
406,"Royal Dutch Shell has agreed a $15.5m (£9.7m) out-of-court settlement in a case accusing it of complicity in human rights abuses in Nigeria. It was brought by relatives of nine anti-oil campaigners, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers. The oil giant strongly denies any wrongdoing and says the payment is part of a ""process of reconciliation"". The case, initiated 13 years ago, had been due for trial in the US next week. It was brought under a 1789 federal law which allows US courts to hear human rights cases brought by foreign nationals over actions that take place abroad. The case alleged that Shell was complicit in murder, torture and other abuses by Nigeria's former military government against campaigners in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Ken Saro-Wiwa and the eight others were members of the Ogoni ethnic group from the Niger Delta. They had been campaigning for the rights of the local people and protesting at pollution caused by the oil industry. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. They were executed after being convicted by a military tribunal over the 1994 murder of four local leaders. Ken Wiwa, 40, son of Ken Saro-Wiwa, said his father would have been happy with the result. He told the Associated Press that Shell's settlement represented a ""victory for us"". Judith Chomsky, of the US-based Centre for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and one of the lawyers who initiated the lawsuit, said she was ""thrilled"" with the verdict. She said it sent a message that ""corporations, like individuals, must abide by internationally recognised human rights standards"". 1990 Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) formed; Ken Saro-Wiwa is president 1993 300,000 Ogonis protest at neglect by government and Shell 1993 Shell pull out of Ogoniland after employee is beaten 1994 Conflicts flare between local communities, military sent to restore order.

Paul Hoffman, a lawyer for the Nigerian families, also expressed his satisfaction. ""We litigated with Shell for 13 years and, at the end of the day, the plaintiffs are going to be compensated for the human-rights violations they suffered,"" he said. ""Had we tried the case and won, the plaintiffs were still looking at years of appeals,"" he said. Mr Hoffman said $5m would go into a trust to benefit the people of Ogoniland - the area Ken Saro-Wiwa was seeking to protect. The rest would go to the plaintiffs and to pay the costs of litigation. Shell has not accepted any liability over the allegations against it. Speaking after the settlement was announced, Shell official Malcolm Brinded said it ""acknowledges that, even though Shell had no part in the violence that took place, the plaintiffs and others have suffered."" The lawsuit alleged that Shell officials helped to supply Nigerian police with weapons during the 1990s. It claimed that Shell participated in security sweeps in parts of Ogoniland and hired government troops that shot at villagers who protested against a pipeline. It was also alleged that Shell helped the government capture and hang Ken Saro-Wiwa and several of his colleagues. ""Shell has always maintained the allegations were false,"" said Mr Brinded. ""While we were prepared to go to court to clear our name, we believe the right way forward is to focus on the future for Ogoni people, which is important for peace and stability in the region.""

407,"Plans to create a new national register of tartan have passed the first Holyrood hurdle.  Plans to enshrine the register officially in law were backed by the Scottish Parliament on Thursday.  The bill, aimed at capitalising on interest around the world, would see a database being set up in Edinburgh.  Holyrood's economy, energy and tourism committee backed the first stage of a bill, put forward by Tory MSP Jamie McGrigor earlier this month.  The bill will now move ahead to the next stage of parliamentary scrutiny.  There are about 7,000 different tartans, with another 150 designs being created every year.  Under Mr McGrigor's plan woven and printed patterns would be registered for a fee of between £80 and £100.  A Conservative spokesman said: ""It is important that we keep Scotland as the Mecca for tartan worldwide and this national register will go a long way in helping to achieve this.  ""Tartan is an icon of Scotland, one that most countries would very much welcome for themselves.""  MSPs previously heard that the tartan industry contributes about £350m to the Scottish economy.  Total costs could reach £75,000 a year for the project, which MSPs were told could run at a loss.  The National Archives of Scotland would create and maintain the register, with input from industry experts.     "
408,"A musician who has led a cult British band for 40 years says he has ""lost any fear"" about being diagnosed with dementia.  Robert John Godfrey, of symphonic rock band The Enid, has been told he has the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease.  The 66-year-old musician and composer said the band can carry on without him.  ""I'm not fearful of the future and I've made the decision to retire and I'm looking to stop participating on stage as soon as possible,"" he said.  Godfrey formed the group in Kent in 1974 and has been the only ever-present member during a 40-year career of ups and downs.  The band, which is currently a six-piece based in Northampton, was signed to EMI and Pye in the 1970s, but has released its albums independently since the 1980s, partly relying on financial support from fans.  More recently they filled the Birmingham Symphony Hall with accompaniment from the the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and poetry from graphic novelist Alan Moore.  ""I have had a great life doing nothing but music - I lost any fear of death many years ago and the story of my life will come full circle as indeed it must,"" he said.  Godfrey, who plays keyboards, said he went to the doctor after a ""scary episode"" in his car when he forgot how to get home.  ""I was diagnosed with minimal cognitive impairment - I've still got all my marbles, but I'm not as fluent in marshalling my thoughts or remembering names and places.  ""Creatively, it's unlikely I'll have problems with my ability to play until the very end.  ""I'm hopeful I'm not somebody who will descend into frustration and anger and start throwing things.  ""I hope I'll just gradually sink in to childhood and be a happy little thing, but there's no way of knowing how this is going to pan out.""  Chris Quince, spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Society, said: ""While research has shown that dementia is the most feared condition for people over 50, it is possible to live well with it.  ""A timely diagnosis is vital to enable this to happen as it opens the door to support, information and potential treatments.  ""It also gives people the opportunity to plan for the future."""
409,"He also welcomed the decision to replace him with Air Force General Joseph Ralston.  It said Gen Clark had been criticised for being ""too political"" simply because he wanted to ""use his authority to actually accomplish something"".  The paper said that he had led the alliance to a victory in Kosovo that essentially saved its credibility and its future.  It said he managed to forge a successful strategy while taking orders from 19 separate allied governments, which did indeed require him to have political skills.  Gen Clark has repeatedly denied speculation that the decision for him to leave his post next April instead of next July was due to his handling of the alliance's 11-week air war against Yugoslavia.  However an editorial in The Los Angeles Times said that ""differences with the White House and the Pentagon clearly are factors in Clark's departure"".  Correspondents say he consistently urged more aggressive tactics, including the possibility of a ground invasion of Kosovo if the air strikes failed.  His request to use Apache attack helicopters in the air war was turned down by the Pentagon.  In an interview published in The New Yorker magazine, Gen Clark acknowledged his frustration with what he called ""the only air campaign in history in which lovers strolled down riverbanks in the gathering twilight ... to watch the fireworks"".  The US Defence Department said Gen Clark's early departure was not a result of dissatisfaction with his performance, but part of a general rotation of American senior ranks.  Nato Secretary-General Javier Solana paid a warm tribute to Gen Clark who, he said, ""has made and will continue to make a major contribution to peace in Europe and to the shaping of a new alliance ready for the 21st Century""."
410,"A painting in the Victoria and Albert Museum has been found to be a work by Italian master Jacopo Tintoretto.  Until recently, The Embarkation of St Helena in the Holy Land was attributed to his contemporary Andrea Schiavone.  But new analysis of the work has revealed it as one of a series of three paintings by Tintoretto, depicting the legend of St Helena And The Holy Cross.  The error was uncovered during work on a project to catalogue continental European oil paintings in the UK.  Detailed records of more than 1,000 paintings have so far gone online as part of the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings (Nice), which aims to catalogue and digitise around 22,000 pre-1900 artworks of continental European origin held in public collections in Britain.  The work by Tintoretto (1518-1594), one of 200 paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum to be reattributed or re-identified, forms part of an exhibition at the V&A which highlights 10 of the most interesting discoveries.  ""Although clearly of high quality, this painting was a puzzle. The subject matter could not be determined, and the canvas support was unusual for such a small painting,"" the curator of the exhibition has written, alongside the newly discovered Tintoretto.  ""It had been catalogued as a work by Andrea Schiavone, a Venetian artist of Croatian origins. Yet the style, with its broken brushwork and a palette of cool greys offset by white, ochre and carmine, is typical of early work by Tintoretto.""  The Embarkation of St Helena was acquired by the V&A in 1865. Its sister paintings, The Discovery Of The True Cross and St Helen Testing The True Cross, are held in galleries in the US.  Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine, is said to have found the actual cross on which Christ was crucified.  Research On Paintings: Technical art history and connoisseurship, is running at the Victoria and Albert Museum until 22 September."
411,"A Pan Am jumbo jet with 258 passengers on board has crashed on to the town of Lockerbie near the Scottish borders.  Initial reports indicate it crashed into a petrol station in the centre of the town, between Carlisle and Dumfries, and burst into a 300-foot fireball.  Hundreds are feared dead as airline officials said flight 103 was about two-thirds full with 255 adults and three children on board.  Rescue teams have confirmed there are many casualties at the scene including townspeople who were on the ground.  The Boeing 747 left London Heathrow at 1800 GMT bound for New York's JFK airport.  Shortly after 1900 the flight disappeared from radar screens at Prestwick Air Traffic Control Centre.  At 1908 there were reports by the Civil Air Traffic Control Authorities of an explosion on the ground 15 miles north of the Scottish border. Details of the accident are still unclear but there are unconfirmed reports the plane has ploughed into cars and houses. An eyewitness said the aircraft has hit a central part of the town in a residential area. ""There was just a terrible explosion, you just couldn't describe it,"" he told the BBC. ""It is just impossible to approach the town but at the time it went up there was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up. ""It was virtually raining fire - it was just liquid fire."" Parts of the town are being evacuated and a hall has been converted into a refuge centre. Dumfries and Galloway Hospital, about 20 miles away, is on emergency alert. Ambulances from southern Scotland and Cumbria have been sent to the scene. The RAF has sent personnel and helicopters from Scotland and Northern England, along with mountain rescue teams to help police. The A74 has been cordoned off after police reported several parked cars on fire. It is thought the plane would have been flying at about 31,000 ft over Lockerbie when it exploded."
412,"At the beginning of the 1960s, an event occurred that changed the sound of Britain's radio forever - the growth of 'pirate' radio stations. What started out as a protest for the freedom to play music ended up challenging the British government and the BBC's rather conservative radio broadcast output. If it had not happened it is possible that commercial radio as we know it may not have been allowed to develop.  At the beginning of the 1960s there were only three national radio stations in Britain, all run by the BBC. In the spirit of public service broadcasting, the government insisted that all programmes were respectable, hopefully educational and impartial - hence the BBC was not allowed to broadcast commercials for fear that advertisers or sponsors could try to influence the quality or content of the programmes.  At the start of the 1960s the BBC played very little contemporary or 'youth-orientated' music, partly because those in charge of output were quite disparaging about pop music, and partly due to existing agreements with the Musicians Union regarding the employment of musicians, which limited the amount of recorded music that could be played. So in the evening, if you wanted to hear pop music you'd have to retune to Radio Luxembourg a commercial station that broadcast from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, in mainland Europe. As it was originally granted a low-powered internal frequency and was not licensed to broadcast to Britain, it paved the way for British audiences to appreciate the later pirate radio stations.  At that time a young Irishman, Ronan O'Rahilly, was managing pop singer Georgie Fame, who had managed to get a few songs into the 'hit parade' with only limited airplay on the larger channels. Ronan decided to start his own station - and realised that the best way to get around the restrictive broadcast policies of the UK would be to transmit his programmes offshore.  A radio station broadcasting from a ship may have seemed an odd idea but Ronan O'Rahilly became inspired by Holland's Radio Veronica, which had been broadcasting since 1960. O'Rahilly was fortunate in that his father was a successful businessman who owned the port of Greenore in Ireland. Through his record company, Ronan raised finance for his first ship. Subsequent would-be pirate broadcasters had to form companies to afford the ships, maintain them and pay a crew and DJs. To do this they ran them, as Radio Luxembourg was run, with commercials or sponsors.  Although the station traditionally celebrates its launch over Easter each year, 27 March, 2004 marks the 40th Anniversary of the first test transmission from Radio Caroline. The station was officially opened by Simon Dee two days later on Easter Sunday 29 March, 1964.  The first ship - which was placed in the North Sea three-and-a-half miles from Felixstowe - was the 763-ton former passenger ferry MV Fredericia. On 27 April, 1964, she was joined by a smaller ship, the 370-ton coaster MV Mi Amigo, which was home to Radio Atlanta. Atlanta and Caroline were at first rival stations, though after a few weeks the two stations merged. The Fredericia sailed around the coast into the Irish sea to become Caroline North while the Mi Amigo stayed in the North Sea as Caroline South. In November 1964, the Mi Amigo was joined there by a major rival. The 780-ton American minesweeper MV Galaxy, housing Radio London.  Other ships soon followed, and stations were also set up in the old wartime forts that still stood in the Thames estuary; the result was that the British coast was soon surrounded by music. The young DJs, the majority of them just into their mid-twenties, were admired for their daring defiance of the government and rebellious choice of playlists. They played upon the 'romantic pirate' image, although in reality they were sometimes homesick or seasick. For audiences exposed to our 'Digital Age', it's difficult to explain the spirit of adventure and challenge that the pirates conveyed. Being confined on board ship for weeks at a time they developed a happy camaraderie that they communicated through their broadcasts to the listeners, a feeling of togetherness and freedom that the land-based stations could not capture. It lasted for over three years, until the Government's Marine Offences Act made it illegal for ships to broadcast within British territorial waters. The pirates were forced off the air on 14 August, 1967. All, that is, except one: Radio Caroline continued alone for another seven months.  Public reaction and loyalty to the pirate stations had not been lost on the BBC however. On 30 September, 1967, the BBC launched Radio 1 as part of a shake-up of their radio stations and, unofficially, as a replacement for the ships. Many of the DJs who'd made their names on the pirate stations were hired for the new station, as well as some from Radio Luxembourg. These were already well-known to the listeners and were experienced at 'personality' broadcasting. BBC programmes had always been presented by announcers who addressed an audience; the DJs aimed to speak to individual listeners.  BBC local radio started on 8 November, 1967, with Radio Leicester. At first, all BBC Local Radio broadcasts were on FM only. Currently, the BBC operates all local, licensed non-commercial radio stations in the UK.  The commercial stations tend to be independent of each other, although some have combined after their inception; some larger areas of the country are now covered by companies that broadcast the same program to the whole area. They have been regulated by the Radio Authority, which changed to OFCOM (the Office of Communications) at the end of 2003.  The Isle of Man has been legally broadcasting commercial radio on Manx Radio since June 1964 on FM and October 1964 on AM. It had its own internal government but needed a licence from the British government, which was reluctantly granted. The Republic of Ireland has always had its own different system of broadcasting. The first legal local commercial radio station within Britain - LBC - started on 13 October, 1973, followed a week later by Capital. The first national commercial station, Classic FM, started in September 1992. It broadcasts mainly classical music, competing with BBC Radio 3 for listeners.  Virgin 1215 AM is, at the time of writing, the only national commercial pop music station. It launched on 30 April 1993.  There are, of course, hospital and student radio stations in the UK, though these broadcasts can only be heard inside the buildings or campuses they serve.  Radio London's Ed Stewart currently broadcasts on Sundays on Radio 2.  Johnnie Walker started his radio career with Radio England before he 'jumped ship' to become one of Radio Caroline's most famous DJs. He is now back on Radio 2's Drivetime show, after an eight month break due to serious illness, from which he has now recovered.  The DJ who opened Radio 1, Tony Blackburn, was voted 'King of the Jungle' in the 2002 round of 'reality' TV programme I'm A Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here. He spun discs on both Caroline and London. Since 1988 he has been on commercial radio, but is now back with the BBC on local station, BBC London.  Many other DJs from the ships still broadcast on various stations all over Britain. All of them owe a huge amount to Ronan O'Rahilly's dream.  Broadcasting from ships did continue at various times throughout the 1970s. Radio Northsea International broadcast off the Dutch coast from the MV Mebo 2, a 630-ton general cargo ship, and Caroline continued on the Mi Amigo, until she sank in the Thames estuary on 20 March, 1980. From 1983 to 1991, broadcasts on 558 FM came from the MV Ross Revenge, a 978-ton Icelandic trawler, 223 feet 4 inches in length, which the Caroline organisation still has and are in the process of restoring. The present plan is to continue occasional broadcasts from the ship for 28-day periods, using a restricted service licence and to arrange tours at other times, but this could change in the future. The 558 frequency now carries Spectrum Radio a local commercial station for London's multi-ethnic community.  Radio Caroline herself is still broadcasting, legally now, via Sky, Worldspace digital and the Internet, still 'Keeping the Dream alive' as it says in the song which became Caroline's theme tune in the 1970s.  During Easter 2004, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pirate Broadcasting, BBC Essex broadcast a week of programmes from the lightship LV18 half a mile from the Norwich coast. DJs from the 1960s who took part included 'Tatty' Tom Edwards, Roger 'Twiggy' Day, Keith 'Cardboard Shoes' Skues and Mike Ahern 'Your DJ Michael A', all former Radio Caroline DJs, along with Pete Brady (formerly of Radio London) and Dave Cash (formerly of 270 and Radio London).  Most of the Radio Caroline DJs had nicknames. Dave Lee Travis had more than most: as well as 'DLT' he was known as 'your dinner record spinner' on the Radio Caroline lunchtime programme. During his time on Radio 1, he became the 'Hairy Cornflake' on the morning Programme and also 'The Hairy Monster'.  Sadly some of the DJs from the 1960s are no longer with us.  For pictures and information on the ships visit The Broadcasting Fleet. For pictures of many of the DJs who worked on them, plus much more information, visit The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame.  For all the main events in the history of UK Radio see the Timeline. The information in this Entry is correct at the time of writing, but stations and schedules are constantly changing."
413,"US pharmaceutical giant Merck has announced it will cut 8,500 further jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015.  The company's shares rose 2.35% to $48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts.  The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.  Merck said it will be shifting its focus to areas it sees as high growth, such as cancer treatment.  It is also pulling products in late-stage trials it estimates will not be so successful, and licensing other products to alternative companies.  The New Jersey-based company anticipates its costs will be reduced by $1bn at the end of 2014, from cutting marketing, administrative, research and development operations.  Kenneth Frazier, chief executive at Merck, said: ""While these actions are essential to ensure that Merck can continue to fulfil its mission into the future, they are nevertheless difficult decisions because they affect our dedicated and talented colleagues.  ""We appreciate the contributions of all our employees, and we will support them during this time of transformation.""  Merck will also be selling property in New Jersey to help save costs.  Alex Arfaei, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said he was concerned Merck was putting too much faith in a handful of experimental drugs.  He said these include a new type of cancer drug that boosts the immune system, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, improved versions of its cervical cancer vaccine and its treatment for hepatitis C.  ""Overall, today's announcement makes us more cautious about the potential of Merck's pipeline"" of experimental drugs, Mr Arfaei said."
414,"Budding music stars in the United States have had their first chance to take part in Pop Idol, the talent search that became a TV phenomenon in the UK. Called American Idol: The Search for a Superstar, thousands of US hopefuls are being judged by a panel of experts, including Simon Cowell, the record executive who was labelled the ""Mr Nasty"" of the UK show. He is joined by 1980s star Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson, of MCA records, to give their opinions on thousands of young singers. The first rounds of auditions were taking place on Monday in New York, and have already been held in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle. Abdul, who had hits with Straight Up and Opposites Attract, said: ""We're looking for good voice, presentation and confidence."" Pop Idol was billed in the US as ""the biggest thing to hit Great Britain since The Beatles"". ""It really was a phenomenon, and we are hoping we can only have some of their success,"" according to Mike Darnell from TV network Fox. The UK show's winner Will Young went on to break the record for the fastest-selling single in chart history. It became a national talking point and the final attracted more than 13 million viewers and a record 8.7 million phone votes. The show's success was recognised on Sunday when it won the prestigious Golden Rose at Montreux for overall best programme. American Idol is being made by the same people that made Pop Idol, led by pop supremo and former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller. The US series is reported to be worth $50m (£35m) to Fuller. As in the UK version, the prize for the winner is a contract with record company BMG, and if the show is a success, they are likely to become instant stars. ""When I dreamt up the idea of Pop Idol, I always saw it is a global concept, and I'm so delighted to see it being made for America,"" Fuller has said. US viewers will see the new show on Fox from 11 June. Talent search shows have had success in the US in the past - pop group O-Town came out of the show Making the Band, but the groups formed on two series of Popstars have not yet made the big time. Several countries have already screened their own versions of Pop Idol - including Spain, where the show broke the record for the biggest ever TV audience. France's Star Academy has also been a hit, while the third series of Popstars in Australia has been searching for just one winner. Pop Idol will follow successful UK TV exports including Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and The Weakest Link."
415,"Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has announced his new cabinet, which is dominated by MPs from his conservative New Democracy party.  Vassilis Rapanos, the chairman of the National Bank of Greece, has been given the key post of finance minister.  The socialist Pasok and Democratic Left parties have two party officials in the cabinet, but have barred their MPs from taking part.  It is believed they may not want to be associated with austerity measures.  The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says the decision of New Democracy's coalition partners not to participate fully in the cabinet does not bode well for the effectiveness of the new government.  One of the sticking points in forming the government has been the composition of the cabinet. Some former Pasok ministers wanted key posts but the party leader decided that none of his MPs should take cabinet positions. The third coalition member, Democratic Left, also kept its MPs out. Why? Clearly to avoid association with unpopular austerity measures to come. It does not bode well for the future strength and solidarity of the coalition. But government sources say all three parties have signed an agreement to support the coalition fully, even without representation in cabinet. The first test comes today at a eurozone finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, when Greece will request that some bailout terms be renegotiated. That may receive a cool response from EU members wary of letting Greece deviate from cost-cutting. But if Athens fails to win significant concessions in the weeks ahead, it would be a major blow for the government, prematurely ending any honeymoon period. Can the new government survive?  New finance minister Mr Rapanos, 65, is a former economics professor who served in the economy ministry when Greece joined the euro in 2001.  Some reports suggest he is seen as being close to Pasok.  New Democracy's deputy leader Dimitris Avramopoulos has taken the post of foreign minister in a smaller cabinet of 18 ministers.  The party won 129 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament on Sunday, including a 50-seat bonus for coming first in the election.  Along with Pasok and Democratic Left, the new government will have a majority of 29.  Mr Samaras became Greece's fourth prime minister in eight months at a brief ceremony at the presidential palace in Athens on Wednesday.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reportedly congratulated Mr Samaras in a letter, saying she looks forward to co-operating with him.  ""You're taking over the country at a difficult time,"" she wrote, as quoted by Greece's Skai TV. ""We all have expectations of your government.""  People in Athens who spoke to Reuters news agency were doubtful the new government could improve the Greek situation.  ""I don't have anything against [Samaras] but I believe that all the old politicians, like Venizelos and Samaras, should leave and something different should happen so we can have someone new,"" said Danae, a 46-year-old kindergarten teacher.  ""Otherwise, I don't think anything will happen.""  Greece will be represented at a eurozone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg by the outgoing Greek Finance Minister George Zanias.  Mr Rapanos is not expected to be sworn in until Saturday.  A top bailout official has warned eurozone states that they must tell Greece to make fresh budget cuts or raise more taxes, or face having to pay themselves.  The country got an initial EU-IMF package worth 110bn euros (£89bn; $138bn) in 2010, then a follow-up this year worth 130bn euros.  It has also had 107bn euros of debt, held by private investors, written off.  Greece's second bailout is ""totally off track, months behind schedule"", Thomas Wieser, head of the key Euro Working Group, told AFP.  Either you ""stick to the fiscal targets and then you need additional measures"" from Greece, he said, or you change deadlines, in which case ""you need extra money""."
416,"At least 10,000 people gathered in central Kuala Lumpur last week to demonstrate against the unfair treatment they say they have had to endure.  Police used tear gas and water cannon to break up the marches.  The level of support was unprecedented, but, aside from the numbers involved, what has particularly concerned the Malaysian government is the ethnic division the protest highlighted.  Modern Malaysia is built on the co-existence of three ethnic groups - Malays, Chinese and Indians.  The protesters were Indians, who make up around 8% of the population, railing against the Malay majority, who account for about 60%.  The country has quotas that ensure preferential treatment for Malays looking for work or those who want to set up a business.  The Indians say this means they lose out.  P Uthayakumar is one of the lawyers who lead the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) - the organisation behind last Sunday's protest march.  Along with two colleagues, he was arrested and charged with sedition before the event, but later released without charge.  He says discrimination was something Indians have always been worried about.  ""The term of reference of Malaysia's independence was equality for all communities, and there were many fears of the Indian community 51 years ago, just before we achieve independence,"" he said.  Now, 50 years on, as Malaysia looks forward to a new era of development, Mr Uthayakumar says those fears have become a reality.  ""There was even one suggestion made... that we would be completely at the mercy of the Malay [Muslim] majority. Today it has become completely true,"" he said.  The marchers were calling for fairer treatment. Education is a key complaint.  They say their Tamil-speaking schools do not get the same money as other public schools, which means the level of teaching is lower.  But in the area of the capital where the Indian community is centred, 21-year-old graduate and telecoms engineer Tavan Aysan said he had done very well out of Malaysia's education system.  ""In my case I didn't face that sort of a problem,' he said, but added: ""It could be my luck.""  But the people around us as we spoke, getting on with their work, illustrated the problem many complain of.  There were men cooking on the pavements as street vendors, and others weaving startlingly bright flower petals into beautiful garlands.  In modern Malaysia, the place where Apple makes its mice and Sony assembles many of its gadgets, flower arranging is not the way to a comfortable future.  The two million Indians in Malaysia are predominantly Hindus, and the Hindraf campaigners say there has been religious discrimination too.  Hindu temples have been torn down to make way for new buildings without proper consultation, they claim.  All of this would be valid grounds for complaint in the eyes of many governments but in Malaysia, protests are not acceptable.  Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi warned people that taking to the streets was not ""the proper way"" in Malaysia.  Even some Indians disagree with the cause of the Hindu Rights Action Force. Those Indians are the ones in government.  The Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) is a founder member of Malaysia's coalition government, the Barisan Nasional (National Front), which has governed the country in some form since its independence 50 years ago.  MIC Secretary General Dr S Subramaniam said that street protests were ""a culture which is totally foreign to this country"".  ""The people of this country are not used to it,"" he said.  ""They are concerned because of the multi-racial element in this country... it can grow into something which cannot be controlled.""  Concern about racial tension boiling over is not just because of what might happen, but because of what did happen.  Hundreds died in racial riots in Malaysia in 1969, when the country was barely a decade old.  The government sees any attempt to replicate that unrest as a threat to the nation itself.  But there is also a contemporary political element to these protests.  A general election is coming here, probably in the new year, and the race card is a vote winner, although you are unlikely to hear many say that overtly.  At the recent annual assembly for Umno - the main party of Malays and the main party in the governing coalition - the politicians warned people not to challenge Malay rights, which lie at the foundations of modern-day Malaysia.  Mr Uthayakumar said that the protest rallies would go on if the prime minister did not begin a dialogue with his organisation.  Further marches are planned across Malaysia over the coming weeks, part of separate campaigns for different causes.  But it is clear that some in this country now seem to have got the bug for demonstrating.  The key difference with last weekend's protest was that it was a protest rooted in ethnic division.  That is why it is such a cause for concern for Malaysia's government."
417,"Flashback: When the Taleban took Kabul   By Terence White, former AFP correspondent in Kabul I was a journalist based in Kabul when the Taleban first marched into the capital and committed an atrocity that most people other than Afghans have probably now forgotten - the brutal murder of President Najibullah, the former communist leader of Afghanistan. It was shortly after 0100 on 27 September 1996, when I monitored nervous radio messages from Afghan guards at the United Nations compound. Najibullah had been living there under UN protection for four and a half years, since his government fell in 1992. The guards told their Western bosses, who were staying in another part of the city, that some people were knocking on the gates demanding to see their ""special guest"". It didn't take a cryptologist's skill to understand that the Taleban had come for Najibullah. Earlier that night the capital had been abandoned by the Afghan Government troops of Ahmed Shah Masood, many of them my neighbours. I was lying in bed, fully clothed and fully awake, flush with adrenaline and uncertainty, pondering how we would be treated by the Taleban. The UN guards were instructed not to resist and a squad of religious militants grabbed Najibullah and his brother, who was staying with him. It wasn't until next morning that, along with tens of thousands of Afghans, I understood how Taleban rule would be. The hapless pair were hanging lifeless from a traffic control box, but they didn't die that way. Their bloodied and mutilated bodies were gruesome testimony to death by torture; Najibullah was said to have been castrated. As self-described champions of Islamic reform the Taleban had set a highly questionable - and to many, repugnant - example of Muslim justice. They also sent an imperious and sinister warning to the potentially rebellious population of Kabul. Next, the religious police from the soon to be dreaded Department for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice appeared on the streets. Their first victims were women, whom they beat with wire cables and hose-pipes when found on the street in violation of the Taleban's first decree, which stated that women could no longer work and must stay at home. This decree illustrated the Taleban's ignorance and bigotry, being a reflection of their Pashtun tribal culture rather than Islam, which does not ban women from work or school. The associated social haemorrhage caused by staff shortages in hospitals and government offices, where women could no longer work, underscored their abysmal lack of organisation and planning. If legitimately in public, to go shopping for instance, women had to be escorted by a male relative. ""Violators have no right to complain,"" was the facile Taleban explanation, and when jobless war-widows bravely demanded how they could feed their children, they were told God would provid. (Foreign aid agencies donated their food.) The next decrees obliged men to grow a beard and for all transportation to stop at the time of enforced congregational prayers. Music was banned and cinemas closed; children were not even allowed to fly kites or keep pigeons as pets. Curiously, the first gamblers, thieves and homosexuals apprehended by the Taleban were not punished severely but paraded through town with blackened faces as a humiliation. However, within a year, public executions, amputations and stonings were a regular Friday event in Kabul. This suffocating litany of decrees was broadcast from Radio Sharia (formerly Radio Kabul), all in keeping with the Taleban's narrow interpretation of Islamic religious law. This might have been acceptable to the people if they were included in the decision making. All major decisions came from the Taleban's spiritual headquarters in Kandahar where their reclusive leader Mullah Mohammad Omar lived. When I was expelled in 1997 on false charges of spying for Ahmed Shah Masood even the foreign ministry in Kabul was powerless to intervene. When Kabul was under threat from Masood the Taleban became more draconian in the enforcement of their rules and they sent goon squads out each night, searching for hidden weapons and dragging ethnic Tajiks off to jail. At these times they also prevented journalists from visiting the front lines. Sometimes you could bluff your way through although I got beaten by angry mullahs for doing this. As battlefield casualties mounted, popular support for the fight against the opposition United Front waned. This obliged the Taleban to increasingly rely on Pakistani and Arab recruits, most of the latter being Osama bin Laden's followers. Reportedly even Chechens and militants from Uzbekistan were among the foreign fighters. These pan-Islamic fighters have committed many atrocities against minority Afghan communities which have further alienated the Taleban. If the Taleban ever objected to Bin Laden's extremist ideology they have never said so. They allowed the proliferation of training camps for Muslim militants from all over the world, which has precipitated the current attacks on Afghanistan by the United States and the UK. I will not be sorry to see the Taleban vanquished, but given yet another war imposed on this poor country, I weep for Afghanistan and the continued price the Afghans must pay for before they can enjoy what many countries already take for granted: peace and prosperity and religious freedom."
418,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ""irresponsible"" image appeared to link teenage girls with sexually provocative behaviour.  The advert shows the model with a bare midriff in a short skirt, tie, shirt and knee-high socks in a classroom.  Ryanair refused to withdraw the image, but ASA dismissed this as ""PR bluster"".  The advert has been removed and it will not run again, an ASA spokesman told BBC News.  Media space owners will not accept the advert again, the spokesman said.  Ryanair, in turn, described the ASA ruling as ""censorship"".  The advert, which was printed in three newspapers reaching 3.5 million readers - the Herald, Daily Mail and Scottish Daily Mail - prompted 13 complaints to the ASA from readers who found it offensive.  After an investigation, the watchdog ruled the advert breached the advertising code's rules on social responsibility and decency.  ""We considered that her appearance and pose, in conjunction with the heading 'Hottest', appeared to link teenage girls with sexually provocative behaviour and was irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence,"" the watchdog said.  The ASA told Ryanair to withdraw the advert and ensure its future promotions complied with the advertising code.  However, the airline said the model's clothing reflected what was currently fashionable among young women and that the number of complaints was insignificant compared to the three newspapers' combined readership.  Ryanair also said its advert was considerably less suggestive than some others appearing in the media.  ""It is remarkable that a picture of a fully-clothed model is now claimed to cause 'serious or widespread offence', when many of the UK's leading daily newspapers regularly run pictures of topless or partially-dressed females without causing any serious or widespread offence,"" said Peter Sherrard, head of communications for the airline.  ""This isn't advertising regulation, it is simply censorship. This bunch of unelected self-appointed dimwits are clearly incapable of fairly and impartially ruling on advertising.""  Mr Sherrard added that Ryanair believed the advert was not irresponsible nor offensive and would therefore ""not be withdrawing this ad"" and would ""not provide the ASA with any of the undertakings they seek"".  Ryanair's stance was dismissed by the ASA spokesman as ""public posturing"".  The Herald, which received a complaint from a reader, said they were not prepared to run it again.  The Daily Mail and Scottish Daily Mail had not received any complaints from readers but said they would not run the promotion again."
419,"If completed, shop closures and job losses are seen as inevitable T-Mobile and Orange plan to merge their UK businesses, creating a mobile phone giant with 28.4 million customers. If completed, a deal between Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile and Orange owner France Telecom would see a firm with sales of 9.4bn euros (£8.2bn; $13.5bn). It would be the UK's largest provider, overtaking Telefonica's O2, with about 37% of the mobile market. It is the second large corporate action in two days, after Kraft Food's £10.2bn takeover proposal for Cadbury. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Orange and T-Mobile said their deal - due to be signed by November - would ""bring substantial benefits to UK customers"", and promised expanded network coverage, better network quality and improved customer services. However, it is likely that competition authorities in the UK and EU will probe the deal. Both brands would remain separate for the first 18 months after the deal was completed while branding options were reviewed. This deal - if it goes ahead - will shake up the UK mobile market. Both brands would stay for a while - but the Orange name is tipped to remain long-term. Being market leader would give it clout when it came to the handsets available. Neither Orange or T-Mobile offer ""must have"" phones such as the iPhone and Blackberry Storm - but this could change. And the firms promise customers will get better network coverage - and there's potential for investing in better, faster 3G networks and data access through mobiles. But not everyone will be happy. The range of tariffs offered by the two companies is likely to be scaled back. Meanwhile, just three major players in the UK mobile market would mean less consumer choice. Which? surveys suggest Orange and T-Mobile have worse customer service than their rivals - and meshing company databases together will bring another challenge. What will it mean for customers? Orange chief executive Tom Alexander would lead the new company, with T-Mobile's UK boss Richard Moat as chief operating officer. Orange employs 12,500 people in the UK, while T-Mobile has a UK workforce of 6,500. A spokeswoman confirmed there would be ""efficiencies"" that could be made across both businesses - but said it was too early to give details of any impact on staff. Integrating the businesses would cost between £600m and £800m, the firms said. This bill would include decommissioning mobile phone masts, cutting back the network of stores and streamlining other operations. Over time, savings should reach about £3.5bn, they added. UK mobile phone operators would welcome consolidation in the sector said lawyer Chris Watson, of CMS McKenna, adding firms saw the current levels of competition as ""ruinous"" because of how low they had to keep prices to win customers. There was very little prospect of the deal being approved by regulators without some alterations, he added, and said ""alarm bells will be ringing"" about price increases. Customers on existing contracts would not see their tariffs changed, he said. ""But when your contract comes up for renewal you may well find the price is more expensive."" Mobile phone analyst Nigel Hawkins told the BBC that it was not unprecedented for a firm to have more than a third of a European country's mobile phone market. ""If the deal goes ahead, then this merged firm, along with O2 and Vodafone will have more than 90% of the UK market and there will be concern that there remains plenty of competition and that this position is not abused."" Deutsche Telekom said earlier this year that it was considering its options for its UK business - which has struggled to win customers in the highly competitive market - which sees five operators and several smaller players compete. Observers say that a joint venture would allow the German firm to avoid the write downs it could face if forced to sell T-Mobile UK for less than it hoped. Meanwhile, for France Telecom, the deal is a way to strengthen its position in the UK market without paying cash or taking on vastly more debt. T-Mobile is currently the fourth-largest mobile operator in the UK, with a 15% share of the market. O2 has a 27% share, followed by Vodafone (25%) and Orange (22%).     "
420,"Two of the former suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation have been jailed for a racist attack on a police officer.  David Norris, 25, and Neil Acourt, 27, were convicted of the attack on Detective Constable Gareth Reid in south-east London on 11 May last year.  Norris, a passenger in a car driven by Acourt, threw a drink and shouted racist abuse at Mr Reid, who is black, as he walked home from Eltham railway station.  At Woolwich Crown Court on Friday, Judge Michael Carroll sentenced the two men to 18 months each.  ""The court has a duty to mark society's abhorrence of racially motivated behaviour, alarm or distress and as far as I am concerned this is one of the more serious incidents of this kind,"" he said.  ""As well as a punishment, I intend to send a signal to others it is not acceptable in Eltham or elsewhere to behave in this kind of way.""  The judge said the men would each serve a minimum of nine months behind bars.  But their lawyer John Hurlock said the pair did not accept their conviction, and planned to appeal against it.  The attack took place half a mile from where Stephen Lawrence was murdered in 1993.  The jury decided that Acourt drove the car straight at Mr Reid because he was black, as part of a ""joint enterprise"" with Norris.  Norris, of Benningfield Court, Chislehurst, Kent and Acourt of Dutton Street, Greenwich, were convicted in July.  Both men had denied the charge of racially-aggravated harassment, causing alarm or distress.  Norris claimed he threw the drink ""in a moment of madness"" brought on by ""nine years of persecution"" following the Lawrence investigation, but denied shouting racist abuse.  Sentencing the pair, the judge made reference to the Lawrence murder, although he added: ""I made it plain that I've no concern as to the details of that matter.""  ""You came into Eltham in a hire car and went to the area where Stephen Lawrence was murdered nine years ago, an event which you have since complained of as leading to persecution and harassment for you both,"" he told Acourt and Norris.  ""You committed this particular offence about half a mile away from where that murder took place, indeed in the same road.""  Police officers who worked on the case welcomed the jail sentences.  Speaking outside the court, Detective Inspector Mark Castell told the BBC: ""These sort of attacks should not happen and today's sentence reinforces that message.  ""The Metropolitan Police Service learned very good lessons from the tragic death of Stephen Lawrence.  ""We will support victims of race crime, victims of all hate crime, and we will help them through the judicial process.""  Chief Inspector Leroy Logan, chairman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said the jail terms handed down should have been longer.  ""We are somewhat displeased that it's not the maximum sentence of two years in view of the nature of the offence and the public interest,"" he said.  ""Police officers in general are subject to abuse, but if people think they can highlight extra differences through colour, culture or origins, they will throw comments at officers.""  Acourt and Norris were among five men accused of murdering black teenager Stephen Lawrence in April 1993.  The Lawrence family brought a private prosecution against the five three years later, but the action was dropped at the committal stage.  Acourt also previously stood trial for murder at the Old Bailey with two others but the judge ordered the jury to return a not guilty verdict."
421,"A Grade II-listed wooden bridge in Gwynedd is to close permanently as work continues on a new £20m road and rail crossing.  Pont Briwet over the Afron Dwyryd river at Penrhyndeudraeth was due to stay open while construction took place.  But the 154-year-old bridge was closed last month over safety fears and will not now reopen, Gwynedd council said.  Motorists will now have an 8m (12km) diversion via Maentwrog to the Harlech road while buses will replace trains.  A temporary road bridge will open in May 2014 with the new crossing due to be completed by 2015. Network Rail said train services will resume from 'Spring 2014'.  Gwynedd council said every effort had been made to keep Pont Briwet open for as long as possible.  ""We have had to come to the reluctant conclusion that there is no option but to close the road bridge with immediate effect as it is no longer fit for public use,"" said Councillor Gareth Roberts, Gwynedd council's cabinet member for environment.  ""We appreciate that this will cause temporary inconvenience for local people and our focus now will be to work with the contractors and all project partners to ensure that the temporary road bridge opens as soon as possible.""  Dafydd Wyn Williams, the council's chief engineer for street care and transportation, said the bridge was being closed for safety reasons.  ""Over the past few months there have been a deterioration in its condition and the road has been temporarily closed to traffic since 20 December,"" he said.  ""During the Christmas holidays a number of large potholes appeared on the carriageway.  ""This together with inadequate edge restraints and uncertainty of the load capacity of the bridge has necessitated the permanent closure of Pont Briwet,"" he added.  Network Rail, which looks after the rail infrastructure, said it understood the inconvenience it would cause, but safety was the ""absolute priority"".  ""Following examinations, we found that the only option to complete the new bridge was to keep the railway line closed until the new structure is in place,"" Mark Langman, route managing director for Wales, said.  Until the new bridge opens Arriva Trains Wales will run an amended timetable with all northbound services from Machynlleth terminating in Harlech.  Coaches and minibuses will take people to Penrhydeudraeth, Porthmadog, Criccieth and Pwllheli and road transport will also be available to take passengers from these locations to connect with southbound trains that will start from Harlech."
422,"Newcastle Jesters face a winner-takes-all clash with Nottingham Panthers on Sunday night to decide who will clinch the final place in the Sekonda Superleague play-offs.  The Jesters triumphed 4-3 in overtime over the Scottish Eagles in Ayr on Saturday.  Panthers will travel to the Telewest Arena knowing they have to win the game in regulation to claim the vital eighth place and leave Newcastle propping up the table.  That is a feat they have not achieved away from home all season in the league.  Jesters, on the other hand, now need just a point after claiming only their third league success in 20 matches in Ayr.  The two teams traded goals through the opening 30 minutes as Jan Mikel and Tony Hand equalised powerplay markers from Jesters' Corey Lyons and Santeri Immonen.  Ed Courtenay then put Eagles in front late in the second period.  But veteran defenceman Rob Wilson turned hero for Newcastle by first netting the equaliser to force the overtime where he then grabbed the winner on the powerplay.  Belfast Giants' defiance of the current foot-and-mouth crisis, by order of league chiefs, led to them suffering a 6-5 overtime defeat to Cardiff Devils.  Despite a ninth successive 7,000-plus crowd, it looked in vain as Belfast trailed 5-1 with 13 minutes remaining.  Ivan Matulik, Steve Thornton, Alan Schuler and a brace from Marco Poulsen comfortably cancelled out Paxton Schulte's opener.  Giants then staged a remarkable comeback as Colin Ward, Rod Stevens (powerplay), Jason Bowen and Kevin Riehl forced overtime.  But Poulsen completed his hat-trick two minutes into the extra period to deny the Giants.  Bracknell Bees made it a six-game sweep of Manchester this season with victory over Storm, who crashed to their seventh successive defeat at Amen Corner.  The in-form Bees' victory was kickstarted after just 34 seconds by Joe Ciccarello, only for a Barrie Moore brace - his second on the powerplay - to give Storm the lead.  And after Rob Trumbley had netted an equalising marker on the powerplay, Reid Simonten, Blake Knox and Jamie Mansoff completed the scoring."
423,"Hundreds of people had been taking part in a May Day protest over alleged corruption and illegal labour.  Police fired shots into the air and used dogs to try to disperse the marchers, as they veered off the route.  Protesters were complaining about the lack of local jobs due to an influx of cheap foreign labour caused by a recent boom in Macau's lucrative casino trade.  They accuse the government of turning a blind eye to the situation.  Some protesters carried signs saying, ""Severely punish employers of black market workers"", while others called for Macau's political leaders to stand down.  ""We are displeased with the labour crisis and the government's lack of action in dealing with it,"" said Ho Hen Kuok, president of the Macau Labour Union.  ""We don't want to see illegal labour being given jobs.""  ""The government is rich, the casinos are rich, but nobody is looking out for the Macau people,"" one marcher told the AFP news agency.  The protest turned violent as demonstrators tried to break through the police cordons lining their route.  Protesters surrounded one police vehicle and threw water bottles and placards at officers, who had boosted their lines with water cannons, the AFP reports.  Police also fired shots into the air, but it was not immediately clear if they had used blank or live rounds to disperse the crowds.  There were no reports of injuries, but several protesters were seen being led away by police.  Unlike nearby Hong Kong - another former European colony which was returned to China in the 1990s - such protests in Macau are uncommon.  Macau's population of 500,000 has a history of co-operation with the Beijing government.  The tiny territory has seen a surge in investment in recent years, with foreign gambling firms - mainly from the US - moving in to build new casino resorts.  Macau workers say that a resulting labour shortage in the territory has led many employers to hire cheap illegal labourers from mainland China."
424,"The building will cost £52m and will take up 19,000 square metres Work is on course to complete Hartlepool's new £52m College of Further Education. The project was one of only 14 from across the country to be given government funding from a list of almost 150 colleges. It should be open by April 2011, and will feature facilities for courses including hair and beauty and sports science, as well as a gym and bistro. BBC Tees' reporter Lee Johnson went to have a look around... Hartlepool's new college has been a long time coming. Work on the new college started in October 2009, but staff had to spend the previous 12 months putting together a business plan to get the funding from the Learning Skills Council. However, what started as a plan to create a £5m extension to the existing college turned into a complete new build, but even that almost didn't happen, as Assistant Principal Andrew Steel explains: ""It's been quite a difficult journey,"" he says. ""I think the skin of our teeth is probably the right way to put it. It took around 12 months just to get the bid put together, and the rules were changing all the time. It's hoped the building will be used by the whole town ""The Learning and Skills council asked us to make the building bigger, and we did that but then it was announced all money was stalled for the project."" In March 2008 the then Labour government announced it was closing the Learning and Skills Council, leaving projects like the one in Hartlepool facing an uncertain future. ""The government said it only had enough funding for 14 of the 145 colleges on the list for funding, so we had to go through an intense bidding process,"" adds Tony. ""As it happened we were one of those chosen but it was a very difficult time for us."" In September last 2009, just weeks before the cut off point for funding to be handed out, the government approved a £52m grant for the new 19,000 square metre building. Andrew Steel says the successful bid was a joint effort: ""We did utilise the local authority, One North East and certainly the local MP, Iain Wright, as well as (former Hartlepool MP and Business Secretary) Peter Mandelson. ""I think without all of that support we wouldn't be stood here today."" The new college will be situated alongside another educational project taking place in the town. The Cleveland College of Art and Design is extending its premises into a former council building, creating what both colleges hope will be an education quarter for the town. But Assistant Principal Andrew Steel says the new college won't just be for students. ""It's not Hartlepool College's building, it's the town's building,"" he says. ""It's located at the gateway into the town, and this will be the first major building people see, and we think it gives a great first impression about what the town is about."" It faced many obstacles, but should be complete in April 2011 The new college will offer students access to state of the art facilities for courses including hair and beauty and sports science. However, it'll also house equipment to use in building services, aerospace and construction and mechanical and electrical engineering. Andrew says tempting companies from across the region, and hopefully the rest of the country, will be vital in maintaining the college and bringing new investment into the local economy. ""We do think it's a state of the art building."" he says ""We have a healthy supply of students, but I think added to that, we're really keen on getting industry in to use the college. ""We want companies regional and national to use the college because the facilities will be second to none.""     "
425,"Standards watchdog Sir Christopher Kelly has said MPs must stop employing relatives if people are to be persuaded that expenses have been ""cleaned up"". He told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was ""essential"" the system was free from any appearance of abuse. More than 200 MPs employ relatives but Sir Christopher's inquiry last year recommended the practice be phased out. Some spouses have said they may launch a legal challenge against any effort to ban them from working for MPs. Sir Christopher - whose committee on standards in public life carried out a seven-month inquiry into MPs' expenses last year - was appearing before Northern Ireland's standards and privileges committee. I think that it is absolutely essential now that in Westminster people should be able to demonstrate that the expenses system has been completely overhauled    He recommended in November that MPs be banned from employing relatives. But it is for another body, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, to decide which proposals to take forward. Its head, Sir Ian Kennedy, has said he believes using family as staff should be banned but has invited other views in consultation on Sir Christopher's proposals. Sir Christopher told the assembly on Wednesday that the practice should end - pointing out it was stopping in Scotland, at the US House of Representatives and the European Parliament. He said: ""Unless and until that happens I don't think that the Westminster Parliament will be able to feel, and to demonstrate, that the arrangements for supporting MPs are being completely cleaned up. ""And I think that it is absolutely essential now that in Westminster people should be able to demonstrate that the expenses system has been completely overhauled and is free not just from any abuse but from any appearance of abuse as well."" He said there had been claims the ruling fell foul of various forms of legislation but he had received legal advice that there would be a ""perfectly adequate defence"" to that. And, while he accepted that many spouses worked beyond what would be expected from other staff members, he said there was a widespread presumption that politicians ""can't be trusted"" and in no other profession - with the partial exception of GPs - was it considered appropriate to employ relatives at public expense. The Northern Ireland Assembly is looking at setting up its own standards commissioner. Sir Christopher recommended whoever it was be given powers to carry out investigations without a formal complaint being made. He made a similar recommendation for Westminster's standards commissioner, John Lyon. People did not always understand why, when there were allegations flying around in the newspapers, politicians were not being investigated, he said. Asked how a commissioner could determine whether to begin an investigation, Sir Christopher said that, in the case of media stories, he or she could contact the journalist in question and ask what evidence they had. Then they could decide whether there was a ""prima facie"" case or whether it was just ""malicious gossip"" - in which case he or she could make a public statement saying ""there was nothing of substance to support the allegation"". Sir Christopher said it was a ""great shame"" that blameless MPs had been tarnished by the expenses scandal, but there ""were many people who must have known that the expenses system was flawed"" and who stood aside and were therefore ""guilty of going along with a flawed system"".     "
426,"A badger cull is under way in England despite protests, the National Farmers' Union has confirmed.  About 5,000 badgers are expected to be killed in controlled shootings over six weeks in Somerset and Gloucestershire.  Supporters say the cull is necessary to tackle bovine TB, which can be spread from infected badgers, but opponents say it is inhumane and ineffective.  The RSPCA said it was ""saddened"", while anti-cull protesters held a vigil as the pilot began, initially in Somerset.  It is understood the cull in Gloucestershire will start later this week.  In a letter to members, National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Peter Kendall said: ""This is an important step not just for cattle farmers but for the whole farming industry.  ""I know that many of you reading this will have suffered the misery of dealing with TB on farm - some of you for decades - and I hope now you will feel that something is finally being done to stem the cycle of infection between cattle and badgers.""  He added that he hoped the culls would show a reduction in TB in cattle, and that more people would understand why they were ""absolutely necessary"".  But one activist from Forthampton, near Tewkesbury, who would only give her name as Lynne, said the cull was ""utterly unacceptable"" and described it as the ""extermination of the badger on British soil"".  She said activists would be calling on people from across England to join their demonstration, by ""interfering with the cull"" and protest walks.  Lynne said she did not believe the cull represented the democratic point of view, was ""completely unscientific"" and would push infected badgers into cull-free zones.  Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the infection needed to be dealt with in both badgers and cattle.  ""We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly,"" he said.  ""If we had a workable vaccine we would use it... a vaccine is at least 10 years off.""  Mr Paterson denied suggestions from anti-cull campaigners that the government was simply trying to appease the farming community.  ""In the Republic of Ireland the disease was rocketing until they began to cull.""  He said there had been a ""significant reduction"" in the disease in Ireland, where culling began in the 1980s.  Scotland is classified as being free of TB. In Wales, vaccination trials are under way. Northern Ireland is researching a mix of vaccination and culling.  ""I want to end up with healthy cattle living alongside healthy wildlife,"" Mr Paterson added.  But Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary, Mary Creagh, said the cull was ""not the answer"".  ""The government's own figures show it will cost more than it saves and it will spread bovine TB in the short term as the badgers are disturbed and spread infection to neighbouring herds.  ""We agree with the scientists that it has no meaningful contribution to play in tackling bovine TB.""  Lord Krebs, who led the Randomised Badger Culling Trial in the 1990s, said the two pilots ""will not yield any useful information"".  Farming minister David Heath admitted in correspondence with Lord Krebs that the cull would ""not be able to statistically determine either the effectiveness (in terms of badgers removed) or humaneness of controlled shooting"".  This was due to the small scale of the pilot culling programme.  Dominic Dyer, of Care for the Wild, which opposes the cull, described the start of the scheme as an ""absolute scandal"".  ""There's no scientific or economic justification for the cull and it may make the spread (of TB) worse not better,"" he said.  ""This is killing without protection - they're not even testing [the culled animals] for TB and they're only monitoring the cull of a small number.""  The RSPCA said it was ""deeply saddened"" to learn that the cull had begun.  Chief executive Gavin Grant referred to the cull as a ""misguided attempt to control bovine TB in cattle"".  He said the organisation was seriously concerned the methods being used to kill the badgers were ""not humane"", and the extent of potential suffering was not known.  ""It is very likely that many of them are lying injured, suffering a painful death,"" he added.  Mr Grant backed other opponents who say scientific evidence shows a cull is unnecessary.  ""Science has shown that this cull is not the answer to bovine TB in cattle. In fact, it could make things a lot worse.""  ""Vaccination and better bio-security are the only sustainable and true ways forward.""  David Barton runs a closed herd on his farm in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.  ""I've lost a third of my herd in the last two years - it's completely devastating,"" he said.  ""These are animals I know, they have characters, and I hear people being very passionate about badgers and I can empathise with them but they're not animals they deal with on a day-to-day basis and they have no idea what farmers like myself are going through.  ""I understand people don't like the idea of it (the cull) - I don't like the idea of it but it has to be addressed.  ""In this area over 50% of the badgers are carrying TB.""  Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan said his force had been preparing for the start of the cull for some time.  ""It's their [the government's] call not ours, but we understand we have a supporting role in ensuring that this democratically-elected government can push its programme forward... and similarly to ensure that people who want to protest within the law are able to do so.""  Earlier, officers were sent out in Gloucestershire to provide ""reassurance"".  The cull will involve marksmen with high-velocity rifles using a mixture of controlled shooting and free shooting, with some badgers being trapped in cages first."
427,"Geoffrey Saxby, from East Sussex, and protester Lois Austin, of Southwark, south London, claimed the tactics in 2001 breached the Human Rights Act.  They were among people corralled in London's Oxford Circus without food, drink or access to toilets.  The appeal court backed the High Court which rejected the claim in March 2005.  Mr Saxby, from Hastings, said he was not involved in the protest but had got caught up in the chaos while collecting money from a bank.  Ms Austin told the court she had to get a friend to collect her 11-month-old daughter from a creche because she was not allowed to leave to pick up her up.  The Metropolitan Police had argued the containment was lawful in order to maintain peace and was necessary to protect public safety and prevent disorder and crime.  The pair, who sought damages alleging false imprisonment and a breach of their right to liberty under the European Convention, were given permission to appeal against the High Court decision.  Agreeing with the High Court judge's earlier ruling, Master of the Rolls Sir Anthony Clarke said the pair's ""imprisonment"" was lawful.  He said: ""The risks were from crushing, trampling and missile-throwing which could have been fatal.  ""The crowd of over 1,000 at Oxford Circus needed measures to be taken to control them for their own protection.""  ""It was a dynamic, chaotic and confusing situation in which there were also a large number of other protesters in the immediate vicinity outside the cordon who were threatening serious disorder and posing a threat to the officers both on the cordon and within it."""
428,"Two High Court judges hearing a challenge to ex-minister Phil Woolas's re-election as an MP have reserved their judgement until October.  Legal arguments were heard on the final day of the specially convened election court in Oldham on Thursday.  Mr Woolas won his Oldham East and Saddleworth seat by just 103 votes in May's general election.  Defeated Lib Dem rival Elwyn Watkins says the vote was swayed by false claims in Labour leaflets.  His counsel has accused former immigration minister Mr Woolas of stirring up racial tension by running a ""risky"" campaign designed to ""galvanise the white Sun vote"" against Mr Watkins, because he was convinced he was going to lose his seat.  Mr Watkins has accused his opponent of implying that he was in league with extremist Muslims who wanted to kill the former minister.  Mr Woolas has defended the leaflets, saying it was legitimate to ask questions about how his opponent funded his campaign, the political company he kept and where he lived.  He has argued that he was targeted by extremists, including receiving death threats, because of the nature of the constituency and his national profile as minister responsible for immigration issues and accused Mr Watkins of not condemning them.  The case has been brought under Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act which makes it an offence to publish ""any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct"" to prevent them being elected - unless they believed it was true and had ""reasonable grounds"" to do so.  It is the first case of its kind in 99 years. Legally, the onus is on Mr Watkins to prove his case if he is to win.  If found guilty, Mr Woolas could be fined and barred from public office, with a fresh election triggered.  Mr Justice Griffith Williams and Mr Justice Nigel Teare have been hearing the case at Saddleworth Civic Hall in Uppermill, Oldham, which has been turned into an election court. A judgement is not expected until October."
429,"The UK title will be decided by a ""best of three"" competition Hundreds of games' fans are expected to descend on a Devon pub next month to fight for the right to be crowned the UK's ""rock, paper, scissors"" champion. The popular game, thought to originate in Japan, has been played for years to settle countless disputes - including whose turn it is to wash the dishes. It relies on quick-fire hand gestures, where rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The championship will be held at the Imperial pub in Exeter on 9 June. The competition has been organised by Tiverton-based Wacky Nation, which specialises in unusual or ""off-the-wall"" events. The game is thought to have originated in Japan Also used as a means of selection instead of coin tossing Organiser Sally Raynes, who claims her first taste of ""wackiness"" ended in complete humiliation when she sank twice in the Mountain Bike Bog Snorkel, said the main aim is to have fun. ""Everyone is down in the doldrums because of the recession and this is something that almost everybody enjoys and knows how to play,"" she told BBC News. ""Mums play it with their children to decide bedtimes and students play it to decide who buys the next round of drinks."" The UK championship title will be decided with a ""best of three"" knockout tournament. There will be a separate competition for children, plus a charity ""winner stays on"" event to raise money for CLIC Sargent. ""People say there are certain strategies that can help with the game and others say you have to be quick of eye, but the truth is absolutely anyone can do it and anybody could win,"" Ms Raynes said.

430,"Mark Cullen and Brad Potts starred to help Blackpool return to League One at the first time of asking with victory over Exeter in the play-off final.  With the game's first attack, Potts found the the bottom corner after Cullen's classy touch and flick.  Ollie Watkins was denied by Sam Slocombe before David Wheeler lobbed the keeper to deservedly put Exeter level.  Blackpool had numerous chances before Cullen prodded in Potts' low cross.  Paul Tisdale's Exeter side dominated possession throughout and almost forced extra time when Watkins headed over in stoppage time.  The Tangerines, who only had around 6,000 supporters at Wembley because of an ongoing boycott by fans in protest against the club's owners, lost skipper Tom Aldred to injury before the break but were not deterred.  The margin of victory could have been bigger for Gary Bowyer's men, with substitute Bright Osayi-Samuel shooting wide and Kyle Vassell seeing an effort saved as Exeter left themselves vulnerable to counter-attacks late on.  As recently as 2011 Blackpool were in the Premier League, but their drop to the second tier after just one season in the top flight was compounded by successive relegations in the past two seasons.  There have been well documented off-field problems too, with the Blackpool Supporters' Trust repeatedly calling for much-maligned owners Owen and Karl Oyston to step aside.  One thing the Lancashire club have not lost is their knack of successful play-off campaigns, with this their fifth final victory - more than any other club.  It also adds to the trend of teams finishing seventh, the final play-off spot in League Two, going up - as it has now happened in five of the past eight fourth-tier campaigns.  With Exeter Chiefs at Twickenham on Saturday in the Premiership rugby union final, this was a bumper weekend of sport for the south-west city with tens of thousands of fans flocking to the capital.  While Chiefs squeaked past Wasps in extra time to be crowned English champions, City fell agonisingly short in their first EFL play-off final, showing the small margins in these one-off matches.  However, Exeter will undoubtedly look back at their season with pride, having gone from the bottom of League Two in mid-November after 17 games to an unexpected Wembley final.  Manager Tisdale is only outstayed in England's top four leagues by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, so there is continuity at the fan-owned club and he is used to regrouping for season after season.  Blackpool boss Gary Bowyer told BBC Sport: ""It was a massive team effort but Cullen made a massive sacrifice for the team after we scored, as we asked him to play in midfield.  ""Exeter, a great footballing team, put us on the back foot and we had to change our shape and then we lost our captain and had to adjust again.  ""It was like a scene from A&E at one point because of the changes that we had to keep making.""  On fans boycotting the final: ""It is a shame because it would have been great to have more here, but the ones that were here made a hell of a noise like they have all season.  ""On the first day that I walked into the club I said we couldn't control it - I was used to that situation at Blackburn, where fans weren't happy with their owners, so I was used that experience.""  Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale told BBC Sport: ""I'm disappointed, clearly. I'm disappointed that we probably didn't do our best in the last half an hour.  ""It's a tough environment to play in - the pressure - and the performance doesn't always get the result.  ""I'm really proud of the players for the season they've had - we certainly will regret today in terms of the result, but we should be very pleased in terms of what we've done this year.  ""We gave ourselves an opportunity, which unfortunately we didn't take, but we'll have to look again for next year."""

He was hoping to make the British Olympic team and his death came a day after he had been given funding to train for the 2010 Commonwealth Games.  Police said a 35-year-old man is to be reported to prosecutors, who will decide if charges should be brought.  In a statement, Mr MacIntyre's family said he was a ""wonderful son, husband, brother and father"".  It read: ""His achievements in the world of cycling were nothing short of wonderful too.  ""The family would like to thank everyone who has been in touch personally as well as by phone and email. This has given us great comfort at this terrible time.""  It added: ""We would also like to thank all the staff at the Belford Hospital in Fort William for their efforts to try and save Jason.""  The cyclist lived in Fort William with his wife Caroline and eight-year-old twin girls.  He was born in Lochgilphead but had lived in Fort William since the age of 10.  Despite not starting cycling until he was 18, he progressed in the sport, winning the Tour of the North in Ireland at the age of 23.  In 2002, he was selected to represent Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester.  Mr MacIntyre won the British 25-mile time trial twice and was the first Scot to win the British Circuit race time trial championship.  He took two years away from racing to help his wife following the premature birth of their daughters.  Mr MacIntyre was airlifted to hospital after the collision but died on his way to hospital on Tuesday afternoon.  The cyclist's website carries a message to visitors under the title The Last Post: ""His death marks the untimely end of a brilliant cycling career.  ""Jason will be remembered by all who knew him for his determination to excel in cycling, alongside the other passion in his life, his wife and children, who are in our thoughts and prayers.""  Cycling legend Graeme Obree said he had great respect for the Lochaber-based cyclist and his death had come as a shock.

She had roused the crowds during the Orange Revolution which swept Mr Yushchenko into power last December.  But on Friday Ms Tymoshenko distanced herself from Mr Yushchenko, who has pledged to root out corruption.  ""Today we are two different teams,"" she said. ""I think these two teams will go their own way.  ""I will not go to the elections with those people who have discredited Ukraine so much. I do not mean the president, but his closest circle,"" she said.  However, she criticised Mr Yushchenko, saying he had ""practically ruined our unity, our future, the future of the country,"" and added: ""I think this step is absolutely illogical.""  Ukraine's acting Prime Minister, Yuri Yekhanurov, has begun trying to form a new government.  President Yushchenko said he had sacked the government because it had become consumed by a power struggle.  He said he acted to preserve the ideals of the Orange Revolution, after his government had been accused of corruption.  Mr Yekhanurov said his priority would be to ensure stability.  Some of the old team are expected to be given jobs in the new administration, says the BBC's Helen Fawkes in Kiev.  The Orange Revolution ousted the regime of former President Leonid Kuchma, widely condemned as corrupt.  But the past week saw three senior government officials resign, precipitating Mr Yushchenko's dismissal of the government.  One of them, a presidential aide, alleged that corruption was worse now than under the previous authorities.  Mr Yushchenko said in-fighting between members of the team had affected affairs of state.  Correspondents say Ms Tymoshenko and the head of the Security and Defence Council, Petro Poroshenko, were at loggerheads from the start.  In a live interview on Ukrainian television, Ms Tymoshenko rejected claims that she had reneged on earlier commitments. She said her cabinet had done an extraordinary job and left the economy in good shape."
433,"               By Susannah Price in Colombo Sri Lanka's justice minister says the Norwegian Government will play an intermediary role in putting a new peace package before Tamil Tiger rebels. The plans include giving greater autonomy to parts of the north and east of the island, where the Tigers are fighting for a separate Tamil state. President Chandrika Kumaratunga had pledged to bring in a new constitution which includes plans to devolve powers to the region and to abolish the executive presidency. Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Professor G L Peiris, said it was the first time the government had been in a position to place a framework for a new constitution before all political parties and the Tigers. The government is sounding increasingly optimistic about its chances of making the long-awaited devolution package a reality. President Kumaratunga unveiled her plans to give more autonomy to the region in a bid to erode support for the Tamil Tigers more than four years ago, but there has been little progress since.    However, Professor Peiris said he hoped a draft could be presented to the Tamil parties which backed the government by the end of the week. After that, the main opposition United National Party would come into the consultation. Last month, the leader of the UNP, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said he would extend his support for the devolution plans, which need a two-thirds majority in parliament. Professor Peiris said this was a breakthrough as previously the inhibiting factor had been the lack of consensus in the south. He said once they had come up with proposals acceptable to all parties, the Norwegian Government would play a role in presenting the proposals to the Tigers. The Tigers have expressed their opposition to the package in the past. Analysts believe they currently see themselves in a strong position with their continuing offensive near the Jaffna peninsula and may not be prepared to talk. President Kumaratunga had also pledged to abolish the executive presidency in her new constitution. Professor Peiris said the concentration of power in the presidency, which left other institutions in the shadows, was not good. However, he added, President Kumaratunga had been re-elected in December and it was a question of balance. With general elections due by August, the government will have to move quickly if it is to adhere to this new, ambitious timetable."
434,"It is widely accepted that under international law, the Jewish settlements in the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 are illegal. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war states: ""The occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own population into the territories it occupies."" Within the international community the overwhelming view is that Article 49 is applicable to the occupation of the West Bank including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. Almost the entire international community, including allies of Israel, have referred to the situation in these territories as occupation. The position that the 4th Geneva Convention does apply to the West Bank, Gaza and Golan Heights is supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, UN bodies, and the International Court of Justice. Israel is a party to the Geneva Conventions, and bound by its obligations. But its government argues that the international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to the Palestinian territories because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state in the first place. Israel has over the years often chosen to use the term administered territories to refer to Gaza and the West Bank. It has annexed the Golan and East Jerusalem. Israel therefore denies the formal, de jure, applicability of the 4th Geneva Convention in the occupied territories. Israel does formally accept the applicability of the Hague Regulations on occupation, and says it is acting under authority granted to an occupying power in international law (including in provisions of the 4th Geneva Convention). The 4th Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulations contain detailed rules on the administration of occupied territory. The Israeli Supreme Court (sitting as High Court of Justice in Beit Sourik Village Council v The Government of Israel 2004) has noted: ""The general point of departure of all parties - which is also our point of departure - is that Israel holds the area in belligerent occupation (occupatio bellica).""

He was dismissed from his posts after the leftist Gang of Four blamed him for the popular uprising in Tiananmen Square in April last year after Premier Zhou Enlai's death.  Since the death of Chairman Mao last September the Gang of Four has sidelined Mr Deng and attempted a programme of radical reform.  Downfall of Gang of Four  But Mao Tse Tung's named successor as CCP chair, Hua Guofeng, has been purging the Party of extremist influences such as the Gang of Four.

The Gang includes Mao's fourth wife, Jiang Qing, former vice premier and politburo member Zhang Chunqiao, former factory worker Wang Hongwen and Shanghai intellectual Yao Wenyuan.  The official CCP newspaper, The People's Daily, last week accused the group of trying to ""rebuild"" the Communist Party, excluding senior officials and creating a ""mass organisation"".  Chinese authorities now regard ""pleading the Gang's innocence"" as a ""counter-revolutionary act"".  A party official in Kiangsi who defended the group recently was ""denounced for his crime"" at a meeting of 4,000 people.

""They always followed the same procedure,"" says Mariola Przewlocka, the manager at the remote Szymany airport in north-east Poland when the strange flights arrived during 2003.  ""We were always told to keep away. The planes would stay at the end of the runway, often with their engines running. A couple of military vans from the nearby intelligence base would go up to them, stay a while and then drive off, out of the airport.  ""I saw several of these flights but never saw inside the vans because they had tinted windows and they never stopped at the terminal building.  ""Payment was always made in cash. The invoices were made out to American companies but they were probably fake,"" says Mrs Przewlocka.  In September 2006, President Bush admitted what had been suspected for a long time - that the CIA had been running a special programme to transport and interrogate leading members of al-Qaeda, away from the public spotlight.  Human rights groups have expressed concerns that the prisoners may have been tortured.  The hunt has been on ever since to locate the secret prisons, or ""black sites"" as they are known.  Poland and Romania have been named by investigators as hosting such sites.  The claims are denied by both governments.  After a week of meetings in smoky Warsaw restaurants and coffee bars with Polish intelligence sources, airport workers and journalists, I obtained what I had been looking for, and something that nobody in authority wanted to reveal, the flight log of planes landing at Szymany airport.  They confirmed my eyewitness's account - that a well-known CIA Gulfstream plane, the N379P, had made several landings at the airport in 2003.  The plane has been strongly linked to the transportation of al-Qaeda terrorists.  Another plane, a Boeing 737, had flown direct from Kabul to this remote Polish airport.  ""There is no particular reason for a Gulfstream to stop there. So there has to be a reason why the plane is stopping there and the fact that everyone is trying to conceal this reason makes it all the more interesting to try to find out what it is,"" says Anne Fitzgerald from Amnesty International.  I followed the route of the military vans from the airport to the nearby secret Polish intelligence base at the village of Stare Kiejkuty.  Surrounded by double-lined fences, security cameras and thick pine forest, visitors are not welcome.  Within five minutes of stopping the car I was approached by a man in a military uniform who made it clear he wanted me to leave.  Was this where a CIA secret prison had been located?  A committee of European parliamentarians who investigated the CIA secret prison programme subsequently concluded in a report:  ""In the light of... serious circumstantial evidence, a temporary secret detention facility may have been located at the intelligence training centre at Stare Kiejkuty.""  Others go further. Marc Garlasco is a senior military analyst with Human Rights Watch.  He says: ""It's almost a foregone conclusion that Poland hosted a CIA Black Site.""  But the authorities in Poland do not want to talk about it.  All requests for interviews with government ministers were rejected. The European parliamentarians met a similar wall of silence.  One civil servant from the prime minister's office claimed a secret, internal inquiry had concluded there had been no ""black site"" in Poland.  ""I think it's quite probable there was a kind of transfer site, a black site, in Poland. There is a Kafka-like mood in Warsaw. No one from the government has the will to answer our questions,"" says Jozef Pinior, a senior Polish politician, who has called for a commission to investigate the claims.  With Polish troops serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, and with the United States as the country's key ally, there is no desire to delve into the secret deals made in the secret war against international terrorism.  The US state department has said it always complies with its laws and treaty obligations and respects the sovereignty of other countries.  But the truth of Poland's role may soon emerge.  The new Democratic-controlled US Congress may begin its own investigation into the CIA secret prisons programme in the next few months.  The search for Poland's secret CIA prison is broadcast in Global Account for the first time at 23.06 GMT on Thursday 28 December on BBC World Service.  A longer version of the same programme, ""Chasing Shadows"", will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20.00 on Tuesday 2 January , repeated Sunday 7 January at 17.00."
437,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A row has broken out between the government and the ex-bosses of MG Rover over who was to blame for the collapse of the UK's last big car firm. Following a damning report, ministers said the so-called ""Phoenix Four"" should apologise for taking millions of pounds out of the failing company. But the bosses described the report as ""a witch-hunt and a whitewash"". After being sold for £10 in 2000, the UK's last major car firm collapsed in 2005, with the loss of 6,000 jobs. Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said work had begun to disbar the Phoenix Four - John Towers, Peter Beale, John Edwards and Nick Stephenson - from running companies in the future. WHO EARNED WHAT AT ROVER? Peston: How did they do it? Who are the Phoenix Four? ""If they themselves don't voluntarily disbar themselves by going to Companies House and signing an undertaking- a binding undertaking that will disqualify them - then I will initiate proceedings in the courts to do so,"" he said It emerged that Phoenix director Peter Beale had installed ""Evidence Eliminator"" software on his computer, despite being aware government inspectors intended to review data on his PC as part of the investigation. Mr Beale also stood accused of giving ""inaccurate and misleading"" explanations to a select committee of MPs. The government-commissioned report found the bosses had awarded themselves pay and pensions worth £42m, which was described by inspectors as ""out of all proportion"". The men bought the Longbridge-based firm from BMW for a nominal £10 in 2000 and paid themselves £9m each between then and April 2005 when the firm went bust. Lord Mandelson said ministers had received no criticism in the report and then Industry Secretary Stephen Byers's handling of the Phoenix deal had been ""faultless"". He told the BBC the Phoenix group had not shown an ""ounce of humility"" about the firm's demise and they owed an apology to the firm's employees and creditors. ""These people feathered their own nests and filled their own pockets full of a lot of cash during the course of their time as directors,"" he said. He rejected as ""brass neck"" the executives' rejection of the report, in which they blamed the government for Rover's failure. In statement the Phoenix bosses said: ""The report is entirely as we expected - a witch-hunt against us and a whitewash for the government. ""It drips with the hallmarks of this government - spin, smear and point blank refusal to take any responsibility for their own actions."" In particular the directors blamed the government for not providing a £100m bridging loan to keep the firm going. 2000: Sold by BMW to the Phoenix Four for £10 2000-2004: Made losses of £611m in the first four years 2005: SAIC pulled out of a deal to save the whole company and MG Rover goes into administration 2009: Serious Fraud Office investigates circumstances of collapse but says no plans for criminal charges 2009: Long-awaited report, which has cost more than £16m, is released Ministers argue the loan would have been illegal under EU law. But the directors insisted: ""Our remuneration was not the reason for the collapse. The real reason is the government bungled the last chance to save MG Rover."" Conservative business spokesman Kenneth Clarke said it was right the report criticised the Phoenix Four, whose behaviour was ""disgraceful"". But he said ministers had shown bad judgement in siding with the Phoenix deal when there were better alternatives. They had also failed to realise before too late ""the project was heading for disaster"", he said. Mr Clarke said questions also should be asked about why Rover was offered a £6.5m public loan on 10 April 2005, two days after the firm went into administration and less than four weeks before the 2005 General Election. He said the inspectors should have investigated the use of taxpayers' money in the middle of an election campaign to keep the company going beyond polling day. The Lib Dems said the government must ensure a repeat of the Rover debacle never happened again. The party said the proceeds of remaining Rover assets frozen pending the report's publication should now be distributed among former workers. The 800-page report into the saga, which cost more than £16m, claimed MPs investigating what happened were given ""inaccurate and misleading information"". The report also identified ""questionable briefings"" to the press by government officials - dismissed by Lord Mandelson as an ""observation not a criticism"". Other findings by the inspectors included evidence of a ""personal relationship"" between a Chinese consultant and Phoenix vice president Mr Stephenson. The inspectors found that a ""Dr Li"" and companies associated with her received more than £1.6m in the 15-month period up to April 2005. The ""Evidence Eliminator"" software installed by Mr Beale claims to ""deep clean"" a computer's disk of any sensitive material, said the report. The inspectors said deleted documents were likely to have been relevant to the investigation and they accused Mr Beale of giving ""untruthful"" evidence during interviews. Mr Beale said the deleted documents were personal, and were not relevant to the investigation. The majority of Rover's assets were sold in 2006 to China's Nanjing Automobile which revived the MG sports car brand, but moved most of the production to China.     "
438,"The danger of a passenger being killed by trailing overhead cables has forced the closure of a metro line in the West Midlands.  Railway inspectors ordered the closure of a stretch of the Midland Metro in Wolverhampton when cables started to droop dangerously low.  Three stations have been shut and shuttle buses provided.  Inspectors said the closure was essential in the interests of safety.  Officials for the troubled £45m rail link said they were working hard to restore the service but could not predict when the stretch would re-open. Alan Spence, of the Railway Inspectorate, said: ""If the cables drop within reachable distance of the ground anybody coming into contact with them would expect to be killed. ""Serving a prohibition notice is not a decision taken lightly. ""But in this case the risk was thought to be such that we needed to stop the use of this stretch of line."" The service from Wolverhampton to Birmingham's Snow Hill station was opened in May 1999. The rail link has been dogged with problems since its inception including windscreen wipers on train cabs which did not work and water leaking through the roofs of some trains. Phil Bateman, spokesman for the Midland Metro, said: ""I can't put a time on when the service will be restored. ""We're working very hard to get it open as soon as possible."""
439,"The Commons standards committee said no action should be taken against the deputy prime minister as he had now registered the visit.  But the rules must change so future abuses can be properly investigated.  The Tories said MPs had given Mr Prescott more than just ""a slap on the wrist"" and there should now be a full independent inquiry.  Tony Blair has previously rejected calls for a such a probe saying he has seen no evidence that ministerial rules had been broken.  But shadow culture secretary Hugo Swire, who first raised questions about Mr Prescott's conduct, said: ""If Mr Blair shies away from this then frankly the ministerial code will not be worth the paper it's written on.""  Mr Prescott said he ""accepted"" the findings of the MPs' report and Downing Street says the problems have now been resolved.  The row centres on Mr Prescott's stay with US tycoon Philip Anschutz, who is bidding for a licence to build the UK's first and only super-casino at the Millennium Dome.  Mr Prescott has strongly denied there was a conflict of interest, saying he was not involved in decisions about the Dome.  The report said Mr Prescott initially appeared to have been in breach of the Ministerial Code.  It said he had taken the view that ""accepting Mr Anschutz's hospitality would not place him under any obligation"".  ""However, what Mr Prescott failed to do at that time was also to address, as the Ministerial Code requires, whether the proposed hospitality was from a source which might reasonably be thought likely to influence ministerial action.""  Mr Prescott had ""come to accept"" that the nature of his relationship with Mr Anschutz ""meant he was accepting hospitality from a source that might reasonably have been thought likely to influence ministerial action"".  That is the key test for deciding whether hospitality given to ministers has to go into the MPs' register of interests.  Parliament's watchdog, Sir Philip Mawer, said Mr Prescott had been ""right"" to register the trip - even if it had been 11 months late.  But he said: ""the key question, which is one for the ministerial code, is whether he should have accepted the hospitality in the first place.  ""That is a matter on which neither the standards and privileges committee or I can express a point of view.""  Sir Philip - and the standards committee he reports to - are only allowed to investigate the rules for MPs, not those for ministers.  The MPs' report calls this state of affairs ""confusing"" for the public.  ""What erodes public confidence is the number of allegations that are around and the absence of clear machinery for resolving them,"" said Sir Philip.  He said an independent figure should be appointed to investigate such complaints and report to the prime minister.  The MPs' report also confirms that Mr Prescott was given a cowboy outfit during his stay at the ranch.  The deputy prime minister says he was given a Stetson hat, a pair of calf length boots, a belt and buckle, a pair of spurs and a pair of jeans worth about £600 in total.  Sir Philip says he is not satisfied by the way Mr Prescott expected these gifts to be declared.  In a statement, Mr Prescott said he fully accepted the watchdog's report.  ""I have registered the stay at the ranch,"" he said.  ""The gifts, which were recorded at the time, will be notified in the annual return to Parliament next week, as is the usual practice.""  He added: ""I and my department also accept Sir Philip's concern about the procedures operated within my department for reporting gifts.  ""I have asked my department to undertake an urgent review of its procedures, and indeed we have already begun to implement new procedures.""  Mr Prescott's friend, Labour peer Lord Snape, said there was no evidence for a ministerial code inquiry.  The MPs had issued the ""mildest possible rebuke"" against Mr Prescott, who had taken advice from his top civil servant about following the code, added Lord Snape.  But Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Don Foster said a ""cloud of suspicion"" would hang over Mr Prescott unless the prime minister ordered an inquiry."
440,"""I wouldn't have stayed at Portsmouth. If a League Two club had come in for me, I'd have left,"" he said.  ""It's as simple as that. That's the way it was when I was there, and that's the way I was treated.  ""I don't regret the move one bit, I'm happy here and I was willing to come in and have a go and I felt I did that."""
441,"Iain Balshaw and Phil Christophers both departed within 25 minutes but tries from Chris Bell and Andre Snyman helped the Tykes to a 20-9 half-time lead.  Gordon Ross added two penalties, while Bath fly-half Chris Malone kicked four.  Despite Bath dominating territory and possession in the second half, Leeds held on for their first major trophy.  The Tykes defended brilliantly as the match wore on and Bath's error count mounted as the clock ticked down.  Bath now have to pick themselves up to try to qualify for the Premiership play-offs, while Leeds will be in next year's Heineken Cup if they preserve their top-flight status.  But they did not let that early setback affect them despite Malone putting Bath ahead with the first of three first-half penalties.  Man-of-the-match Ross punished Bath indiscretions at the breakdown with two long-range efforts from just inside the Bath half in the 12th and 18th minutes.  The Tykes lost a second England international after 25 minutes when Christophers was forced off after a kick to his ribs from his own scrum-half, Alan Dickens, at a ruck.  The impressive Ross glided through a gaping hole in the Bath midfield and chipped over the remaining cover where Bell claimed the ball and forced his way over.  Ross converted for a 13-3 lead, but two more Malone penalties hauled Bath to within striking distance as the interval beckoned.  But the Australian fly-half then suffered a horror moment when his speculative long pass was intercepted by Snyman on his own 22.  When Malone landed his fourth penalty five minutes after the resumption, the stage appeared set for a Bath fightback.  But another effort hit an upright after 50 minutes and despite plenty of possession generated by their pack, Bath's backs looked clueless as to how to turn it into points.  A botched overlap with 17 minutes left was typical of their lack of craft, and when Malone pushed a penalty wide with 10 minutes left, Leeds sensed it would be their day.  Despite not scoring a point in the second half, they held on with some desperate defence.  Number eight Alix Popham brilliantly stole possession close to his own line and Snyman knocked back Matt Perry with an all-enveloping tackle.  Referee Dave Pearson's final whistle sparked wild celebrations in the Tykes' ranks, and utter despair in Bath's."
442,"Yorkshire have confirmed that former umpire Dickie Bird is to be voted in as the club's president at their Annual General Meeting on 29 March.  The 80-year-old played for Yorkshire and Leicestershire from 1956 to 1964, scoring 3,314 runs in 94 matches.  He went on to umpire 66 Test matches before retiring in 1996.  Bird told the club website: ""Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would become the president of the greatest cricket club in the world.""  ""It is a tremendous honour and I am very humble and proud. I am grateful to chairman Colin Graves and the Yorkshire Board for nominating me and I'm looking forward to my term in office.""  Bird will replace former England and Yorkshire batsman Geoffrey Boycott as the county's president and will serve a one-year term."
443,"A security guard found guilty of murdering the ex-wife of former South African President, FW de Klerk, has been sentenced to life in prison.  Marike de Klerk, 64, was found stabbed and strangled in her luxury Cape Town flat in December 2001.  The Cape High Court sentenced Luyanda Mboniswa, 22, to one life term for murder and a second life term for robbery with aggravating circumstances. He also received three years for housebreaking.  ""You showed absolutely no remorse whatsoever throughout this trial. There's no doubt that the communities out there are looking to the court for protection against crimes of violence that you have committed,"" said Judge John Hlophe.  Mboniswa was acquitted on a rape charge. He showed no emotion in court and was led away by police.  The judge said the defence had not provided any evidence to contradict the prosecution's case that Luayanda Mboniswa, had robbed and killed her.  He worked at the sea front block of flats at the time.  However, Mboniswa was acquitted on charges of rape.  Mrs de Klerk battled depression in her later years after the former president left her for his mistress.  They divorced in 1998 after 39 years of marriage.  She was the country's first lady from 1989 to 1994, the period during which Mr de Klerk released the African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela from prison and dismantled the country's apartheid system.  Mrs de Klerk was at one point in charge of the then ruling National Party's women's wing.  President Thabo Mbeki described her as a ""strong, charming and dignified woman"".  Her body was found after she failed to keep a hairdresser's appointment.  Mboniswa was arrested two days later."
444,"A convicted child killer has been found guilty of the murder of a teenager in Berkshire 46 years ago.  Yolande Waddington, 17, was found strangled in the village of Beenham in October 1966.  David Burgess, 64, was jailed for life in 1967 for the killing of nine-year-old girls Jeanette Wigmore and Jacqueline Williams in Beenham.  He was charged with Yolande's murder following advances in DNA techniques and convicted after a five-week trial.  The jury at Reading Crown Court convicted Burgess by a majority verdict of 11 to one.  Jurors had been deliberating since Monday.  Speaking on behalf of the family outside court, Yolande's brother Giles Waddington broke down as he read from a statement.  He said: ""We're grateful that justice has now been completed and that Yolande's murderer has been identified after more than 45 years.  ""Yolande's murder had a traumatic and irreversible effect on our family life and has cast a long shadow over nearly five decades.""  Yolande had only recently moved to the village to work as a nanny at a farm when she was killed.  She was last seen alive at the Six Bells pub on the evening of Friday, 28 October 1966.  During the trial, the jury heard Yolande's naked body was discovered in a ditch beside a farmer's barn two days later.  She had been stabbed and strangled and tied up with a jumper knotted around her face.  Blood from Yolande's attacker had been found on a number of items, including her comb and hair band.  Detectives from Scotland Yard were sent to Beenham to help with the investigation and carried out the first ever mass blood screening, with samples taken from 200 males in the area aged between 16 and 60.  A sample supposedly from Burgess was also taken, but it failed to meet one of the tests and was deemed not to be a match.  Police believe he may have got someone else to give a sample on his behalf or the specimen was labelled incorrectly.  Last year, Thames Valley Police carried out a review into the case and using a new technique obtained a partial DNA profile which matched Burgess's.  Pete Beirne, the force's principal investigator of cold cases, said: ""David Burgess has never accepted his guilt despite confessing to the crime to prison officers on three separate occasions.  ""He has never fully explained how or why he killed Yolande."""
445,"Actors Andrew Lynford and Mark Homer both decided to leave the show after discussions with Executive Producer Matthew Robinson.  ""They have mutually agreed that both characters have fulfilled their potential and will conclude their stories with a dramatic exit,"" said a spokeswoman for the series.  She added they will still be appearing in EastEnders until at least the spring.  The announcement comes days after Patsy Palmer - Bianca Butcher - revealed she was leaving to have a child.  Viewers this week saw barmaid Tiffany Mitchell - Simon's sister and Tony's ex-girlfriend - take a horrifying tumble down the stairs of the Queen Victoria in some of the last scenes Martine McCutcheon filmed before leaving.  The stormy relationship did not last, but the way the show portrayed Tony coming to terms with his bisexuality was widely praised.  Three out of the four mainstream soap operas have had gay characters in recent years. Anna Friel shot to fame through her portrayal of Beth Jordache in Brookside, while Emmerdale's vet Zoe Tate, played by Leah Bracknell, came out of the closet in 1993.  But now only Emmerdale is left - something lesbian and gay campaigning group Stonewall is unhappy about.  ""Gay characters did seem to be on the rise for a while, but now they've got a bit of a low profile,"" said Stonewall spokesman Matt Aston.  ""We'd like to see a few more positive role models in the media, especially to encourage young people who are coming to terms with their sexuality, as well as their friends and members of their family.""  ""And as with any kind of exposure of these issues, people are made more aware of them and the problems people have with their sexuality. People also link them with us and get in touch to talk about it.""  An EastEnders spokeswoman declined to say whether the programme would deal with more gay issues in the future.  The only mainstream soap which has not had any gay characters is Coronation Street.  Its producers say the show is not ""issue-based"" - but the programme has been praised for storylines involving transexual character Hayley Patterson.  But homosexuality on TV is still a highly charged issue - Beth's infamous kiss with nanny Margaret in Brookside attracted both praise and criticism.  Channel 4 executive Jacquie Lawrence told the Edinburgh International Television Festival in August she wanted to see ""gay consultants"" advise drama producers.  ""From British television, you wouldn't know what lesbians did in bed. You only ever see one woman,"" she said.  ""The other one is so far off camera she might as well be down the paper shop buying The Guardian."""
446,"A new £89m technology centre is set to open in Scotland by 2014 after securing its final piece of funding.  The centre, at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, has been awarded £6.7m in European funding.  The facility will bring together academics and industry to work on new technologies in areas such as energy, engineering and pharmaceuticals.  Scottish government agencies are contributing £26m to the scheme, with the university supplying £57m.  The £6.7m funding is coming through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  Strathclyde University's principal, Professor Jim McDonald, said: ""With our partners in business and industry, we are seeking breakthroughs to deal with energy demands, climate change, global health challenges, a testing economic climate and the need for more energy efficient, more advanced technology.  ""The competitive advantage the centre will deliver, the inward investment it will attract and the valuable training the building project will offer apprentices will complement the economic benefits of Glasgow's Commonwealth Games in 2014.""  Infrastructure Secretary Alex Neil added: ""It is a substantial boost for our renewables industry that we have secured the final £6.7m that will enable this world class project to go ahead.  ""I am sure this project can prove a real boost for our economy, securing massive research investment and hundreds of new jobs."""
447,"In a broad attack on airlines' efforts to tackle carbon emissions, Ian Pearson said Ryanair was the ""irresponsible face of capitalism"".  But Mr O'Leary said Mr Pearson was ""silly"" and ""hadn't a clue what he is talking about"".  Mr Pearson also said the attitude of US airlines to emissions was ""a disgrace"".  In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Pearson said: ""When it comes to climate change, Ryanair are not just the unacceptable face of capitalism, they are the irresponsible face of capitalism.""  He also attacked British Airways, saying it was ""only just playing ball"" on environmental regulations, and Lufthansa, the German airline.  Mr O'Leary defended his company and the industry as a whole.  ''We are the greenest airline in Europe but you know being savaged by a dead sheep - as we were by this minister this morning - is like water off a duck's back.''  ""What he should be attacking is the power generation stations and the road transport who between them account for over 50% of emissions.""  He said the ""silly"" minister and ""eco-lunatics"" were targeting the aviation industry when it accounted for 2% of the problem.  Even though his company was growing, the new planes it had invested £10bn in the last five years had cut its emissions and fuel consumption by 50%, Mr O'Leary said.  He added: ""He hasn't a clue what he's talking about and is attacking the wrong target in the airlines.""  But Green Party MEP Caroline Lucas said Mr Pearson should resign or scrap the government's aviation expansion plans.  ""Ian Pearson's comments are absolutely incredible,"" she said.  ""If anyone other than a government minister had made them they would have been a useful contribution to our efforts to tackle climate change.  ""But for someone with collective responsibility for the government's support of the biggest expansion of the aviation industry in a generation to do so is nothing less than a deceptive admission of failure.""  Chancellor Gordon Brown attempted to boost the government's green credentials in his pre-Budget report by doubling air passenger duty from £5 to £10 on short haul flights. Passengers on long haul flights could pay up to £80 extra.  But green campaigners said the increased levy would make little difference to emissions.  Friends of the Earth said if the government was serious about fighting climate change it should scrap airport expansion plans and tax breaks for the air industry.  Ryanair has opposed efforts by the EU to control aviation carbon emissions by including them in a trading scheme, saying it would discriminate against low-cost airlines.  The EU's scheme will see airlines pay for exceeding their current level of emissions.  Flights within Europe will come under the jurisdiction of the Emissions Trading Scheme by 2011.  The scheme would be expanded from 2012 to include all international flights that arrive at or depart from an EU airport.  Airlines would be issued with pollution permits - those that cut emissions would be able to sell their surplus while an airline that increased its emissions would have to buy more permits.  The US has already questioned whether it would be legal within global trading rules to force airlines flying into the EU to take part in the scheme.  And there are reports that US airlines are considering legal action to overturn the EU's efforts.  In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""Urgent progress is needed to ensure that aviation addresses its climate change impacts.""  Toby Nicol, spokesman for Budget airline Easyjet, said the company ""stands full-square with the government"" on the proposal to include EU internal flights and international flights in the carbon trading scheme.  Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Chris Huhne said Mr Pearson's focus should be directed at the chancellor to encourage him to make ""the right framework to ensure that airlines are sustainable in the long run so the planet is there for our children and our grandchildren rather than whinging about the airlines."""
448,"Singer James Blunt has told the BBC how he refused an order to attack Russian troops when he was a British soldier in Kosovo. Blunt said he was willing to risk a court martial by rejecting the order from a US General.  But he was backed by British Gen Sir Mike Jackson, who said: ""I'm not going to have my soldiers be responsible for starting World War III.""  Blunt was ordered to seize an airfield, but the Russians had got there first.  In an interview with BBC Radio 5 live, broadcast on Sunday, he said: ""I was given the direct command to overpower the 200 or so Russians who were there.  ""I was the lead officer with my troop of men behind us...  ""The soldiers directly behind me were from the Parachute Regiment, so they're obviously game for the fight.  ""The direct command [that] came in from Gen Wesley Clark was to overpower them. Various words were used that seemed unusual to us. Words such as 'destroy' came down the radio.""  The confusion surrounding the taking of Pristina airfield in 1999 has been written about in political memoirs, and was widely reported at the time.  But this is the first time Blunt has given an account of his role in the incident.  Blunt, who was at the head of a column of 30,000 Nato troops with his unit, told Pienaar's Politics it was a ""mad situation"".  He said he had been ""party to the conversation"" between senior officers in which Gen Clark had ordered the attack.  ""We had 200 Russians lined up pointing their weapons at us aggressively, which was... and you know we'd been told to reach the airfield and take a hold of it.  ""And if we had a foothold there then it would make life much easier for the Nato forces in Pristina. So there was a political reason to take hold of this.  ""And the practical consequences of that political reason would be then aggression against the Russians.""  Asked if following the order would have risked starting World War III, Blunt, who was a 25-year-old cavalry officer at the time, replied: ""Absolutely. And that's why we were querying our instruction from an American general.  ""Fortunately, up on the radio came Gen Mike Jackson, whose exact words at the time were, 'I'm not going to have my soldiers be responsible for starting World War III', and told us why don't we sugar off down the road, you know, encircle the airfield instead.  ""And after a couple of days the Russians there said: 'Hang on we have no food and no water. Can we share the airfield with you?'.""  If Gen Jackson had not blocked the order from Gen Clark, who as Nato Supreme Commander Europe was his superior officer, Blunt said he would still have declined to follow it, even at the risk of a court martial.  He said: ""There are things that you do along the way that you know are right, and those that you absolutely feel are wrong, that I think it's morally important to stand up against, and that sense of moral judgement is drilled into us as soldiers in the British army.""  Blunt left the Army in 2002 to pursue a career in music, later scoring a worldwide hit with You're Beautiful.  You can listen to the full interview on the BBC Radio 5 live website"
449,"Arnold Meri, who is now 88, was a highly-decorated soldier in the Soviet Red Army, and is a cousin of the Baltic state's late President, Lennart Meri.  He is said to have organised the 1949 deportation of 251 civilians from Hiiumaa Island, off the west coast.  Mr Meri has admitted participating, but says he played only a minor role.  Estonia's security police say more than 40 of those deported either died on the way to, or in, the Siberian camps.  Mr Meri said that at the time, he was just a lowly civil servant on the island.  He was quoted in the Eesti Paevaleht newspaper as saying: ""It's true that I took part in the deportation action at Hiiumaa, but I am being wrongly accused.""  Estonia has been gradually attempting to prosecute those who helped in the deportation of more than 20,000 Estonians to Siberian camps after World War II."
450,"Former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher is under observation in hospital after breaking her arm. The 83-year-old suffered the injury in a fall at home but is said by her office to be ""recovering well"". She had been due to return home after treatment but doctors at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital have decided to keep her in overnight. Britain's first woman prime minister celebrated the 30th anniversary of her election victory earlier this week. Lady Thatcher's office said there were no complications or other health issues to be concerned about, following her accident. ""The hospital's decided, just to be sure, to keep her in for observation,"" her spokeswoman said. ""It's a simple fracture, but bearing in mind who she is, she's 83 and the shock to the system, it's just belt and braces. There is nothing untoward."" They confirmed she had tripped and fallen at about 0800BST. An ambulance was called and she was transferred under police escort, with her special branch protection detail, to the hospital. She was given an X-ray and it was discovered she had fractured her upper arm. Lady Thatcher, who led Britain from 1979 to 1990, has become increasingly frail in recent years and has suffered a number of minor strokes. Her daughter Carol has also spoken about her struggle with dementia. Ill health forced her to abandon her regular public speaking engagements in 2002 but she still makes public appearances. In March last year she spent the night in hospital after feeling unwell while having dinner with friends. But earlier this week she was at the Carlton Club in London to mark the 30th anniversary of her historic election victory. In September 2007 Gordon Brown surprised many of his own backbenchers by inviting the peer to visit Downing Street and praising her as a ""conviction politician"".     "
451,"Government commissioners have been lined up to intervene at Rotherham Council where a culture of ""complete denial"" over child sexual exploitation in the town was exposed.  A report commissioned by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the authority was ""not fit for purpose"".  Council leader Paul Lakin has resigned and the council cabinet will also quit.  An earlier inquiry found 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, mainly of Pakistani origin, from 1997 to 2013.  The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the latest report, by Louise Casey, the director-general for troubled families at the Communities Department, identified ""a number of potentially criminal matters"".  Files passed to the NCA relate to one former and one existing councillor arising from the inquiry, Ms Casey's spokesperson said.  Investigators found the council had a ""deep-rooted"" culture of cover-ups and silencing whistleblowers, Ms Casey said.  It also found the child sexual exploitation (CSE) team was poorly directed, suffered from excessive case loads, and did not share information between agencies.  Ms Casey said: ""This inspection revealed past and present failures to accept, understand and combat the issue of child sexual exploitation, resulting in a lack of support for victims and insufficient action against known perpetrators.""  A spokesman for the NCA said it would ""examine a number of potentially criminal matters identified during a recent inspection of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.""  Mr Pickles said he planned to give control of the council to a team of five commissioners, including an overall lead and one tasked specifically with looking at children's services.  They would ""provide new leadership"" and take over the roles of the ""wholly dysfunctional cabinet,"" he said.  The council has 14 days to respond to his ""wholly exceptional"" proposals, Mr Pickles said.  He also plans to impose early elections in 2016.  The elections would give people a chance to ""renew the membership of their council and elect those they have confidence in"", he explained.  He said he hoped control would be returned to Rotherham Council as ""rapidly as possible"".  In a statement the council said it needed ""time to understand and respond to the detailed report"".  It said: ""We recognise the need for a fresh start that is so clearly identified in the report, but also appreciate that we need to continue to deliver services to the people of Rotherham, and ensure business continuity.  ""We should not forget that the publication of this report will re-open old wounds for the victims and survivors of CSE.  ""We will continue to put in place the help and support they need at this difficult time, including our dedicated helpline.""  Ms Casey was asked by Mr Pickles to inspect the council in the wake of the Jay Report in August 2014.  ""You could tell with my appearance. I went to five-and-a-half stone and different coloured hair. I was a totally different person.  ""Obviously, there were warning signs there. I wasn't going to school, I wasn't going home so there's no way that they couldn't have realised that something was wrong.  ""A worker got involved with me. She was trying to tell people what was happening but nobody would listen.  ""There were various authorities that knew what was going off and decided to ignore it. I had a child protection officer, she ignored it, someone from social services, they ignored it.  ""There were various meetings about me, which were saying if there was anybody found to be dead it'd be me.""  The inspection team reviewed about 7,000 documents, looked in detail at case files and met more than 200 people, including current and former staff, council members, partners, victims and parents.  According to the report, child abusers in Rotherham are identified but ""little or no action is taken to stop or even disrupt their activities"".  Rotherham Council demonstrated a ""resolute denial"" of the child abuse that was taking place, the report found.  Ms Casey said the local authority was ""repeatedly told"" by its own youth service what was happening.  It chose, she said ""not only to not act, but to close that service down.""  Attitudes within the council include dismissal of Prof Jay's findings, denial of knowledge of the ""scale and scope"" of CSE, blaming others and denial that CSE remains a serious problem in present-day Rotherham.  The council also had an ""excessive deference"" to South Yorkshire Police, preventing the use of council powers to tackle perpetrators, and a lack of scrutiny over the police's actions.  Investigators were told that former council leader Roger Stone had been ""a bully"".  ""What Stone said, went,"" a senior officer told the investigation. ""Everyone was terrified of Stone.""  A councillor said: ""He is a bully, in my opinion. In Labour group he would impress himself on people, male or female. A lot of women have felt a sense of suppression and macho culture.""  Mr Stone declined to be interviewed by investigators but sent a statement instead.  In the days after the Alexis Jay report was published, Rotherham council promised much - they'd learn lessons, they'd support victims, they'd change. It hasn't happened.  Behind closed doors, they've poured scorn on the Jay report, still fear being called racist rather than acknowledge problems with Pakistani heritage men and most damningly of all are still failing to protect vulnerable children.  Faced with such appalling incompetence, the government have acted in the only way they could.  Changing the culture and practices of the council won't happen overnight but it's necessary.  The people of Rotherham - in particular the children at continuing risk of sexual abuse - deserve nothing else.  Ms Casey's report is the latest in a series of investigations following the publication of the Jay Report in August 2014.  Prof Alexis Jay found an estimated 1,400 children had been sexually abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.  Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated.  Staff at the council did not report issues for fear of appearing racist, Ms Casey's report found.  But the investigators said that by failing to take action against the abusers of Pakistani heritage, the council had ""inadvertently fuelled the far right and allowed racial tensions to grow"".  The report added the lack of action had done a great disservice to the Pakistani community.  Two investigations by Commons committees have been launched since the Jay Report was published and a number of high-profile figures have resigned including Shaun Wright, South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner, who had been a councillor in the town and responsible for children's services.  Roger Stone, the chief executive Martin Kimber and the council's director of children's services Joyce Thacker also quit.  Mr Wright also refused to be interviewed for Ms Casey's report and sent a statement saying he had been unaware of the extent of the abuse.  The National Crime Agency has taken over the investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and is in the preliminary stage of its inquiry.  Last month, Ofsted admitted to the Communities and Local Government Committee that its inspections of children's services in the town had been ""not good enough"".  Inspectors from the regulator failed to spot the extent of child sexual exploitation in the town over several years, rating the council as adequate.  Meanwhile, police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating 10 South Yorkshire Police officers over their handling of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham."
452,"New era for policing and justice in Northern Ireland  David Ford is leader of the cross-community Alliance Party Northern Ireland's new justice minister David Ford will have a special place in Stormont history, in more ways than one. His office is situated in Castle Buildings where the Good Friday Agreement - the so-called peace deal - was signed in April 1998. When he sits down down at his new desk, he will become the first Northern Ireland politician to hold security powers since 1972. That was the worst year of the Troubles - 479 people were killed. Northern Ireland was in turmoil, and local politicians were not trusted by the then Prime Minister Edward Heath to be in charge of justice and policing. It is a measure of how much has changed in recent years that those powers are now being handed back. However, such powers are still so sensitive that the two largest parties, the DUP and Sinn Fein, could not agree on a unionist or a nationalist candidate. David Ford is the leader of the cross-community Alliance Party. It's a bit like the stabilisers coming off the bicycle. We're being given the chance to prove ourselves and demonstrate that we're grown up enough to go forward without any help    The 59-year-old former social worker studied economics at university and now looks like being faced with the biggest numbers of his career - a department with 4,491 employees, and a £1.4bn budget. Two-thirds of the money is taken up with policing. The job description can be boiled down to three words - keeping people safe. It is easier said than done, particularly given the threat posed by dissident republicans opposed to the peace process. Also, the marching season will soon begin in Northern Ireland. There will be no time for a relaxed, settling-in period. The minister will not be able to interfere with the day-to-day running of the police or courts, but will decide on overall policy and could reshape parts of the system. If the new minister wants to make a mark before the next Assembly Election in May next year, there will not be much time to do it. Stand by for a high-action few months. Clues to what David Ford may try to do can be found on the Alliance Party website. It talks about the need for a long list of measures including: * more visible policing on the streets; * reform of and within the Northern Ireland Prison Service. All of the above will take time. It is unlikely that a week after the devolution of policing powers that anything much in Northern Ireland will seem to have changed. However, the level of accountability will rise significantly. Policing and justice matters will be scrutinised like never before, and if you have a bone to pick with the minister in charge, you no longer need to wait in the arrivals lounge of Belfast International Airport for him or her to arrive on a plane from London. The new minister faces a huge challenge, and so does the entire power-sharing executive, as they exercise the new functions handed over from London. However, some see it as an opportunity rather than a challenge. One Stormont insider put it like this: ""It's a bit like the stabilisers coming off the bicycle. We're being given the chance to prove ourselves. And demonstrate that we're grown up enough to go forward without any help."" Don't be surprised if there are a few wobbles along the way.     "
453,"There are currently over a 100 female MPs in the House of Commons. The campaign for women to have the right to vote began in earnest during the second half of the nineteenth century. John Stuart Mill initiated the first debate in Parliament on the issue in 1867. From then on attempts were made to widen the franchise nearly every session, without success. Only one small advance was made - in 1869, when female ratepayers were allowed to vote in municipal elections. The cause took on a more militant aspect in the early 1900s with the formation of the Women's Social & Political Union and the activities of the Pankhursts which frequently led to imprisonment and even force-feeding of hunger-striking suffragettes. The onset of the First World War led to a ""truce"" to concentrate on the war effort, in which women were heavily involved. After the war, an electoral reform conference recommended a limited measure of women's enfranchisement. In 1918, women over 30 were given the right to vote, quickly followed by the passage of a law enabling women to be eligible for election as Members of Parliament at the younger age of 21. But only 17 out of 1,623 candidates at the subsequent general election were women. Christabel Pankhurst polled the most votes at the election but failed to gain a seat: the only woman to be elected, Constance Markievicz, did not campaign and, as a Sinn Fein member, never took her seat. The first woman to do so was Nancy, Lady Astor, elected for the Sutton division of Plymouth at a by-election in 1919. She made her maiden speech in February of the following year and, in 1923, piloted the first ever bill sponsored by a woman onto the statute book. The first woman minister was Margaret Bonfield in 1924 (Ramsey MacDonald's Labour government); she became a cabinet minister in 1929. Voting age for women was reduced in 1928 to 21 (the same as for men). It was not until after the Second World War that another milestone was reached - the first woman was nominated at the beginning of the 1946-7 session to the Chairman's Panel which allowed her to preside over a debate of the whole House in committee, which she did on 31 May 1948. The first woman to occupy the Speaker's chair was Betty Harvie Anderson (Conservative), appointed deputy chairman of the Ways and Means committee (a deputy speaker) in July 1970, taking the chair later that day during the Queen's Speech debate when she was addressed as 'Mr Deputy Speaker'. The first woman Speaker, Betty Boothroyd (Labour) was chosen in 1992 (in the first contested election since 1951). She had been a Deputy Speaker since 1987. Margaret Thatcher was, of course, the first female prime minister - from 1979 until her resignation in 1990, having been elected Conservative party leader in 1975, deposing Edward Heath. She holds the record for the longest serving twentieth century prime minister - eleven and a half years. Ironically, Mrs Thatcher's election to the premiership brought with it the lowest tally of female MPs (19) since 1951. This situation was reversed by the general election of May 1997, when a particularly large number of women MPs were elected to the Labour benches (101). In all 120 women were elected to Parliament in 1997.     "
454,"A police officer has been stabbed to death during riots at the Broadwater Farm housing estate in Tottenham, North London.  Another policeman was shot and injured after a night of horrific violence between the police and hundreds of black and white youths.  By midnight 58 policemen and 24 other people have been taken to hospital.  It is the first time shots have been fired in a British riot.  The trouble was sparked off by the death of local resident Cynthia Jarrett who died of heart failure after four policemen burst into her home during a raid yesterday.  Earlier today, her family met to discuss her death with the police and demanded an inquiry. They made it clear they did not want any kind of public disorder.  Britain's first black council leader, Haringey's Bernie Grant, issued a statement condemning the police for the way they searched Mrs Jarrett's house.  The trouble began at 1845 GMT when police were called to Mount Pleasant, Willan Road and The Avenue.  They were pelted with bottles and petrol bombs, cars were overturned and set alight as were shops and other buildings. There was widespread looting.  About 500 police with shields, helmets and truncheons battled with rampaging youths threw bricks, bottles and cans from walkways within the estate as fires turned the night sky red.  At around 2145 GMT several gunshots were heard and one officer was shot and seriously wounded in Griffin Road.  Half an hour later a police officer was stabbed in the neck, suffering serious injuries. He died later in hospital.  Ten minutes after the stabbing another officer was shot and slightly wounded.  One senior officer said: ""This is not England. This is just madness. My men are being used as target practice.""  He said three of his men had sufferd burns but that the police did not have the resources to tackle the intense violence.  ""We haven't got the weapons to combat this kind of sickening violence.""  Teargas equipment is on site but senior commanders are reluctant to use it for fear of harming residents trapped inside their homes.  Police have blocked entrances to the estate to contain the riot.  The Tottenham riots come just a week after violence erupted in Brixton, south London following the accidental shooting of Cherry Groce."
455,"As they slowly recover from the shock of being thrown to the TARDIS floor, the Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara all seem to be acting strangely. A number of unexplained events occur and suspicions are raised that some alien force may have entered the ship. The Doctor at one point even accuses Ian and Barbara of sabotage.  It gradually dawns on the travellers that what they have been experiencing is an attempt by the TARDIS itself to warn them of something. The Doctor ultimately realises that the 'fast return' switch he used when leaving Skaro has stuck, and the ship has been plunging back to the beginning of time and its own destruction.  Once the problem - a faulty spring - is corrected, the TARDIS returns to normal and the Doctor is forced to make some apologies.  Having drugged his companions' drinks with a sleeping draught, the Doctor returns to the TARDIS control room. There he inspects the controls and is about to try operating them when he is interrupted by someone apparently intent on strangling him.  The TARDIS arrives in a new location where the weather is very cold. Leaving the ship to explore, Susan and Barbara find what appears to be a giant's footprint in the snow.  The claustrophobic atmosphere is reminiscent of The Outer Limits.  Barbara Wright : [To the Doctor] ""Accuse us! You ought to go down on your knees and thank us! Gratitude's the last thing you'll ever have... or any sort of common sense either!""  Barbara Wright : ""We had time taken away from us and now it's being given back to us... because it's running out!""  The Doctor : ""As we learn about each other so we learn about ourselves.""  The TARDIS's power source is held beneath the central column. The TARDIS has an inbuilt memory of previous locations, and the console features a fast return switch (the malfunctioning of which causes the crisis). [The alarm sound the fault locator makes is an early version of the Cloister Bell.] Susan and Barbara share a very spartan sleeping area.  Skaro is seen on the TARDIS scanner.  Susan and the Doctor have a telepathic link, both to each other, and to the TARDIS: its stranger attempts to warn them seem to be visionary in nature. It takes the Doctor a long time to work out what's going on, and he seems very afraid, suggesting some degree of unfamiliarity with the TARDIS.  Ian would surely have mentioned had he heard more than one heartbeat from the Doctor (cf The Sensorites).  The Doctor and Susan have visited the planet Quinnis in the 'fourth universe' ('where we nearly lost the TARDIS four or five journeys ago,' notes Susan). [Since the Doctor seems not to learn about parallel universes until Inferno, Susan must mean 'galaxy' (cf Galaxy 4).] The coat the Doctor loans Ian is said to have been given to him by Gilbert and Sullivan.  The Doctor shows astonishment at the suggestion that the TARDIS might actually be alive.  This story had the working title Beyond the Sun. (This was a working title for the previous story, The Mutants.)  The story was written as a late addition to the schedule because the sets for Marco Polo were not ready in time. (It was a late addition, but the real reason was that Donald Baverstock, the Chief of Programmes for BBC1, had yet to give his approval for any more than thirteen episodes to be made. Thus, with 100,000 BC at four episodes and The Mutants at seven, an additional two part story was required in case the series should then be cancelled.)  'Fast Return Switch' is written in felt tip pen on the console.  William has a bit of a nightmare, completely throwing the others during one scene by saying the same line (""It's not very likely"") twice, and fumbling ""You knocked both Susan and I unconscious"". He also omits the scripted explanation for the melted clocks  Title Music - Ron Grainer and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, arranged by Delia Derbyshire  'We've had time taken away from us, and now it's being given back because it's running out.' The Edge of Destruction manages to flesh out the central figures at the expense of the plot.  Considering its origins as a hasty 'filler' written to bring the initial episode count up to thirteen, Inside the Spaceship works remarkably well. As Deanne Holding put it in TARDIS Volume 6 Number 3/4 dated October 1981: '[Inside the Spaceship] is unique in that it features no alien menace, no strange planets to be explored, no supporting cast and no sets other than the TARDIS interior. It is a suspense story, in the Hitchcock tradition, and, as such, it is quite stunning.'  Even at this early stage, though, the impact of the Daleks was being felt. 'The first week of Doctor Who without Daleks was flat,' wrote Peter Quince in the Huddersfield Daily Examiner dated 15 February 1964. 'Admittedly, Susan went mad with a pair of scissors, clocks were smashed [sic] most mysteriously and Barbara thought the ship had been invaded by an unseen presence, but none of these excitements could make up for the loss of those ravishing robots. They have been the hit of the winter on all channels, though I doubt whether the BBC's plans to market them in do-it-yourself form will be all that successful. The craze will have died away by the time the Daleks reach the shops - unless of course the designer can include a real live death-ray in each packet - but I doubt whether the post-master general would like that.'  The restriction imposed on the production of having to take place largely within stock sets resulted in two episodes set entirely within the confines of the TARDIS. This allowed David Whitaker to devise a story in which the still fragile relationships between the leading characters initially fall apart, and then crystallise into far stronger friendships than existed before.  The first episode is full of misdirection as the characters try to come to terms with what might have happened to them. This involves some strangely stilted acting from Carole Ann Ford and William Russell, who speak their lines as though they are simply reciting them from a page, and one really starts to get the feeling that - as the Doctor suspects - the ship may have been invaded by some outside force that is now masquerading as one of the travellers. The analogy with a theatrical play is not too off beam, as the limited number of sets and the relatively static camera angles give the viewer the impression of watching as the action unfolds, act by act, on a stage.  It is unfortunate that this approach does not appear to suit Ford, who seems ill at ease with the strange and dislocated Susan that she is called upon to play. Russell settles down after initial problems, while Jacqueline Hill and William Hartnell seem unaffected by the demands of the claustrophobic scripts. This 'staginess' could be seen as a failing of the production, but this would perhaps be unfair.  'The technical limitations of the production are obvious to the modern viewer,' commented Trevor Wayne in Gallifrey Issue Twelve dated autumn 1980, 'but this is largely due to the fact that [it was] almost experimental in [its] own day. Not only that, the producers stretched television technology to its limits to achieve a sense of wonder in the programme that to today's viewer, used to slick bland productions, will just seem shabby.'  By the end of the first episode, all the options have been exhausted and the Doctor drugs his companions so that he might investigate the problems without further interference. But the drugs don't work, and Ian attempts, for no apparent reason (other than to provide an episode ending), to strangle the Doctor.  After an uncertain first episode, the second is far better. Richard Martin, the director for the former, was relatively new and inexperienced at the job (which is why Christopher Barry was brought in to assist on the previous story), and Frank Cox, handling the latter, does much better. The action is tighter and the whole thing gathers momentum as the travellers realise that the danger may be of their own making. There are revelations and a conclusion that is elegant in its simplicity.  The undoubted high point of the adventure comes when the Doctor is forced to confront a furious Barbara, who is understandably upset at the accusations he earlier directed at her and Ian, and has to do the one thing that it appears he is most uncomfortable with: apologise and admit he was wrong. Nick Davison, writing in Star Begotten Volume 2 Number 1 dated winter 1988, put it well: 'The complete success of the character development is apparent when you realise the drama - the real drama - comes from the desire to see the characters reconcile their differences.'  Although the majority of fans regard this most simple of adventures with considerable fondness, there are others who take a different view. 'The greatest pity... is that it had real potential,' wrote Vanessa Bishop in Skaro Volume V No. II dated October/November 1990. 'It is perhaps the [series'] only venture into the realms of a disaster movie... The ""stuck-in-a-lift"" - albeit a big one - scenario could've equalled the two previous tales. The TARDIS is [a brilliant invention] and yet, in this tale, becoming the fifth protagonist, it is immediately sent up - with its vast technology, it throws its crew into oblivion because of a jammed spring! Ironic, quaint, or just plain ridiculous?'  Whatever one's feelings about the plot, there is no denying that at the conclusion all the characters are on good terms again, and their relationships have been strengthened in a way that simply having them experience adventures together arguably could not have achieved. Inside the Spaceship allows the characters to grow - and to grow closer."
456,"Mr Dahlan, an MP and former security chief and minister, organised Gaza's biggest pro-Fatah rally on Sunday.  Speaking in an Israeli media interview, he said Hamas had lost popular support.  ""They have lost the Palestinian street which sees what they have become: A bunch of murderers and thieves who execute... Fatah members,"" he said.  He added that the show of support on Sunday, attended by thousands of Fatah loyalists, ""proved to Hamas that Gaza is not theirs"".  Hamas won last year's parliamentary elections for the Palestinian Authority, taking power from Fatah which had dominated Palestinian institutions for decades.  Factional tensions erupted into deadly armed clashes in the Gaza Strip in December, when Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, of Fatah, called for early elections.  At least 30 people have died in the fighting over the last month, and more than 100 have been wounded.  After Sunday's rally, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum accused Mr Dahlan of bringing Palestinians to the brink of civil war.  ""We remain vigilant in the face of these putschists and their plots,"" Mr Barhum said at a news conference, quoted by AFP.  Mr Dahlan once enjoyed a high profile career in the Palestinian Authority in both the political and the security sphere.  He is reviled by Hamas and other Islamist groups for a crackdown he instigated against then in the 1990s when the PA was committed to stamping out militant attacks against Israel.  He remains a powerful figure in Fatah, but in the Haaretz interview he denied reports he had been put in charge of Mr Abbas's security forces again.  Instead, he said his task was to build up grassroots support for Fatah in the Gaza Strip, and he claimed the rally in Gaza on Sunday was proof of his success."
457,"The Dreamworks label includes artists such as pop singer Nelly Furtado and the band Papa Roach.  The music business is currently going through major changes as it struggles to counter falling sales and the impact of unofficial online music sales.  Last week, Sony Music - the second-largest music company - said it was planning to merge with Bertelsmann.  EMI and Warner Music have also been in talks about a possible merger.  Neither Universal nor Dreamworks disclosed the value of the deal, although the Reuters news agency reported a person close to the talks as saying it was worth about $100m (£60m).  ""We are truly excited about the acquisition of Dreamworks Records,"" said Doug Morris, chairman and chief executive of Universal Music Group.  ""(The Dreamworks team) have built an incredible roster comprised of gold, platinum and multiplatinum-selling artists as well as a host of new acts who will be successful in the future.""  Mo Ostin, principal executive at DreamWorks Records, said: ""Despite the challenges of the music business today, Universal is acquiring a wonderful asset and the sale will assure the strongest possible future for our artists."""
458,"They said security ""hurdles"" had to be removed so they could hold a crucial internal meeting first.  The peace talks, which had already been postponed, were due to take place on 24-25 April.  Meanwhile the army said rebels had killed four soldiers in a mine attack in the northern town of Vavuniya.  The Tamil Tiger rebels wrote a letter to Norwegian peace brokers saying: ""Until the hurdles in front of us to attend Geneva talks are removed and a more conducive environment created, our team is unable to come to the talks.""  The Tamil Tigers' eastern commanders were to have made the journey north for an internal meeting on Saturday.  After days of negotiations, both the government and the rebels had agreed to a civilian vessel transporting the regional leaders, escorted by unarmed international truce monitors.  Sri Lankan navy ships were to have observed from a distance.  But the Tamil Tigers cancelled at the last minute, saying they had not agreed to the navy vessels being present.  ""Ceasefire monitors had told us that the navy would not interfere with our travel in any way,"" S P Tamilchelvan, political wing leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam told the BBC News website.  But ceasefire monitors insist Tamil rebels had agreed to the Sri Lankan navy vessel escorting them.  ""It was part of the agreement. The rebels should have read the clauses carefully. We are frustrated,"" said Helen Olafsdottir, spokesperson for the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission.  ""It looks like both parties seemed to have completely lost sight of what is important. If Geneva peace talks don't happen then we can expect an escalation of violence as it happened a few months ago,"" she said.  The peace negotiations were to have been the second round of talks on strengthening the implementation of the four-year-old ceasefire.  The first round was held in February in the wake of serious violence in the preceding two months, after Norway indulged in shuttle diplomacy to bring both parties to the negotiating table.  At least 160 people - including about 100 soldiers and sailors and many civilians - died in the upsurge of violence since last December.  Tamil Tiger supporters say more than 50 Tamils have been killed by the security forces in the same period, while others blame some of those deaths on the rebels or other armed groups.  The sides were originally scheduled to meet on 19 April, but the rebels sought a postponement."
459,"Mark Selby completed a memorable comeback to beat Ronnie O'Sullivan in the Welsh Open final on Sunday. The Leicester man battled back from 8-5 down to beat O'Sullivan 9-8 at the Newport Centre and claim his first world ranking title. The 24-year-old, who won the Wembley Masters last month, admitted he had surprised himself by his recent form. ""Who'd have thought this?"" he said. ""Eighteen months ago I was still in the qualifiers at Prestatyn."" O'Sullivan began the contest as favourite to clinch his 20th ranking victory, a milestone only previously achieved by Stephen Hendry (36) and Steve Davis (28). And while he was gracious in defeat, he also took a swipe at Selby's style of play. I thought Ronnie was going to run away with it    He said: ""I play an attacking game and try to grab it by the scruff of the neck. I got away with it early on but Mark was very tactical. ""I don't know if Mark's talented; he plays a very negative game. He doesn't take a ball on unless he's going to leave it safe. ""It makes him tough to play because you know you're in for long frames and long bouts of safety. ""It's hard to get a rhythm against someone like that, but I can't grumble because I had my chances."" Selby is undoubtedly in the elite now. That's not even up for debate.    Selby, beaten in three of his four previous meetings with O'Sullivan, confessed that his tactics had been key to the victory. He said: ""Overall I think scoring-wise Ronnie was obviously the better player. I wasn't scoring but my safety play kept me in it. ""I didn't play as good as I did in the Masters final, but I had to go to plan B and thankfully I came through."" When Selby fell 8-5 behind he was convinced he had no chance of winning. He added: ""I thought Ronnie was going to run away with it, but I nicked a good frame to go 6-5. Then it was 8-5. ""Against Ronnie if you give him a one-frame lead he will go and steamroller it, so to give him four frames I thought there was no chance."" Selby enjoyed the best of the early exchanges, compiling a 77 break in the first frame then producing a 39 clearance to steal the second on the black for a 2-0 lead. O'Sullivan finally came to life with a run of 50 in the third and drew level at 2-2 heading into the mid-session interval with a clearance to blue in the fourth. Those opening four frames took an hour and 34 minutes to complete and the exchanges remained equally bogged down after the restart. During the fifth, which Selby won thanks primarily to a 51 break, O'Sullivan was twice spotted mouthing ""I'm bored."" But he retained sufficient patience and concentration to secure an extremely scrappy sixth frame, which dragged on for 32 minutes, on the brown. There was then further stalemate as the seventh and eighth frames were re-racked by referee Eirian Williams after a tactical impasse in both. Each of the afternoon's closing two frames featured sizeable contributions - 75 and 60 from Selby to regain the advantage at 4-3 and a 108 from O'Sullivan to tie up the scores heading into the concluding session. Breaks of 93 and 135 made it 6-4 in only 18 minutes as O'Sullivan took control, but world number five Selby kept himself in touch with a pressure clearance of 72 to reduce his arrears. O'Sullivan immediately hit back with a 63 break to make sure of the 11th frame, leaving him needing two frames for victory. He took the next thanks to a 54 break, but Selby rallied to make it 8-6 after pinching the 14th frame. And the Midlands man pulled even closer with a 62 break to trail by just one frame, before forcing a decider by winning the 18th frame by 14 points Selby then pocketed a cool 48 break in the decider to lead by 30 points and, after O'Sullivan missed an ambitious double, the Leicester cueman held his nerve to close out the win.

460,"Former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui has been expelled by the Kuomintang (KMT) Party which he led for more than 12 years.  The party's disciplinary committee said Mr Lee had maliciously harmed the party by campaigning for a rival political grouping.  Mr Lee has accused his former colleagues of getting too close to mainland China.  1988 - Lee Teng-hui becomes first native President of Taiwan and KMT leader  Though he stood down as president last year, Lee Teng-hui remains one of Taiwan's most influential political figures. His expulsion from the KMT is likely to deepen already bitter political divisions on the island.  Mr Lee introduced democracy to Taiwan after decades of one party rule; he was also the first native Taiwanese to lead the KMT - which ruled mainland China until losing a civil war to the communists in 1949.  His background played a key role in winning local support for a party which many Taiwanese had regarded as an alien organisation.  Yet many KMT traditionalists accused Mr Lee of abandoning the party's goal of seeking reunification with the mainland. Some left the party, splitting its vote in presidential elections last year, when Mr Lee retired.  This led to the KMT losing power in Taiwan after half a century - and many party loyalists blamed Lee Teng-hui.  But his personal popularity made the KMT reluctant to expel him.  In recent months though he has campaigned openly for a new political grouping - the Taiwan Solidarity Union - ahead of parliamentary elections in December. He has also accused the KMT's new leaders of betraying Taiwan by getting too close to China.  Analysts say his expulsion could lead some KMT members to quit the party in sympathy. But it may also encourage supporters of closer ties with China to renew their links with the party.  This could lead to a re-division of Taiwanese politics into two clear blocs:  Some fear this could only deepen ethnic divisions between native Taiwanese (who have been on the island for generations), and those who came over from the mainland with the KMT in the 1940s."
461,"Slaves were owned in all Islamic societies, both sedentary and nomadic, ranging from Arabia in the centre to North Africa in the west and to what is now Pakistan and Indonesia in the east. Some Islamic states, such as the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean Khanate, and the Sokoto caliphate [Nigeria], must be termed slave societies because slaves there were very important numerically as well as a focus of the polities' energies. Many societies throughout history have practised slavery, and Muslim societies were no exception. It's thought that as many people were enslaved in the Eastern slave trade as in the Atlantic slave trade. It's ironic that when the Atlantic slave trade was abolished the Eastern trade expanded, suggesting that for some Africans the abolition of the Atlantic trade didn't lead to freedom, but merely changed their slave destination. It's misleading to use phrases such as 'Islamic slavery' and 'Muslim slave trade', even though slavery existed in many Muslim cultures at various times, since the Atlantic slave trade is not called the Christian slave trade, even though most of those responsible for it were Christians. Slavery was common in pre-Islamic times and accepted by many ancient legal systems and it continued under Islam. Although Islam is much credited for moderating the age-old institution of slavery, which was also accepted and endorsed by the other monotheistic religions, Christianity and Judaism, and was a well-established custom of the pre-Islamic world, it has never preached the abolition of slavery as a doctrine. The condition of slaves, like that of women, may well have improved with the coming of Islam, but the institution was not abolished, any more than it was under Christianity at this period. Islam's approach to slavery added the idea that freedom was the natural state of affairs for human beings and in line with this it limited the opportunities to enslave people, commended the freeing of slaves and regulated the way slaves were treated: Islam greatly limited those who could be enslaved and under what circumstances (although these restrictions were often evaded) Islam treated slaves as human beings as well as property Islam banned the mistreatment of slaves - indeed the tradition repeatedly stresses the importance of treating slaves with kindness and compassion Islam allowed slaves to achieve their freedom and made freeing slaves a virtuous act But the essential nature of slavery remained the same under Islam, as elsewhere. It involved serious breaches of human rights and however well they were treated, the slaves still had restricted freedom; and, when the law was not obeyed, their lives could be very unpleasant. A poignant paradox of Islamic slavery is that the humanity of the various rules and customs that led to the freeing of slaves created a demand for new slaves that could only be supplied by war, forcing people into slavery or trading slaves. The legality of slavery in Islam, together with the example of the Prophet Muhammad, who himself bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves, may explain why slavery persisted until the 19th century in many places (and later still in some countries). The impetus for the abolition of slavery came largely from colonial powers, although some Muslim thinkers argued strongly for abolition. Slaves came from many places Unlike the Atlantic slave traders, Muslims enslaved people from many cultures as well as Africa. Other sources included the Balkans, Central Asia and Mediterranean Europe. Slaves could be assimilated into Muslim society Muhammad's teaching that slaves were to be regarded as human beings with dignity and rights and not just as property, and that freeing slaves was a virtuous thing to do, may have helped to create a culture in which slaves became much more assimilated into the community than they were in the West. Slaves in the Islamic world were not always at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Slaves in Muslim societies had a greater range of work, and took on a wider range of responsibilities, than those enslaved in the Atlantic trade. Some slaves earned respectable incomes and achieved considerable power, although even such elite slaves still remained in the power of their owners. Muslim slavery was not just economic Unlike the Western slave trade, slavery in Islam was not wholly motivated by economics. Although some Muslim slaves were used as productive labour it was not generally on the same mass scale as in the West but in smaller agricultural enterprises, workshops, building, mining and transport. Slaves were also taken for military service, some serving in elite corps essential to the ruler's control of the state, while others joined the equivalent of the civil service. Another category of slavery was sexual slavery in which young women were made concubines, either on a small scale or in large harems of the powerful. Some of these women were able to achieve wealth and power. These harems might be guarded by eunuchs, men who had been enslaved and castrated. Where did the slaves come from? Muslim traders took their slaves from three main areas: Non-Muslim Africa, in particular the Horn While Islamic law does allow slavery under certain conditions, it's almost inconceivable that those conditions could ever occur in today's world, and so slavery is effectively illegal in modern Islam. Muslim countries also use secular law to prohibit slavery. News stories do continue to report occasional instances of slavery in a few Muslim countries, but these are usually denied by the authorities concerned.

Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions  Islamic law and custom provided no basis for the abolition of slavery or even for the curtailment of the slave trade. Bernard Lewis, The Shaping of the Modern Middle East, 1994 Although the vast majority of contemporary Muslims abhor slavery, it remains part of their religious law. Islamic sharia law accepted (and accepts) slavery, as did other legal systems of ancient times such as Roman law, Hebrew law, Byzantine Christian law, African customary law and Hindu law. The world was very different in those days, and practices that seem profoundly unethical to modern minds were common and accepted. During the formative stages of shari'a (and for the next millennium at least) there was no conception of universal human rights anywhere in the world. Slavery was an established and lawful institution in many parts of the world throughout this period... Slavery was too fundamental to the structure of Arabian society in the 7th century to be abolished easily. Doing so would have estranged many of the tribes that Muhammad sought to bring together, and severely disrupted the working of society. Prohibiting slavery in the context of seventh-century Arabia apparently would have been as useful as prohibiting poverty; it would have reflected a noble ideal but would have been unworkable on an immediate basis without establishing an entirely new socioeconomic system. But this was a problem, since Islam placed a high value on human dignity and freedom. The fact that slavery is a major concern in Islamic law no doubt stems from the prevalence of slavery at the time when Islam was instituted combined with the fact that the Qur'an clearly presents universal freedom and human dignity as its ideal society. Its recommendation that slaves be freed is on the same plane as its recommendation that the poor be clothed and the hungry be fed. So the early Muslims restricted and regulated slavery to remove some of its cruelties, but accepted that it was legal. ... The most that shari'a could do, and did in fact do, in that historical context was to modify and lighten the harsh consequences of slavery and discrimination on grounds of religion or gender... Shari'a recognized slavery as an institution but sought to restrict the sources of acquisition of slaves, to improve their condition, and to encourage their emancipation through a variety of religious and civil methods. Nevertheless, slavery is lawful under shari'a to the present day. Is slavery still legal in Islam? The answer is that slavery is legal under Islamic law but only in theory. Slavery is illegal under the state law of all Muslim countries. Theoretically Islamic law lays down that if a person was captured in a lawful jihad or was the descendent of an unbroken chain of people who had been lawfully enslaved, then it might be legal to enslave them. Nonetheless, should the legal condition for the enslavement of anyone be proven (because he had been taken prisoner fighting against Islam with a view to its extirpation and persisted in invincible ignorance in his sacrilegious and infidel convictions, or because there did exist legal proof that all his ancestors without exception had been slaves descended from a person taken prisoner conducting a warfare of such invincible ignorance) Islam would be bound to recognize such slavery as legal, even though recommending the freeing of the person and if possible his conversion, in this modern age. Tabandeh, Muslim Commentary on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, quoted in 'Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shari'a and Basic Human Rights Concerns, in Liberal Islam, ed Charles Kurzman, 1998 In practice, it seems virtually impossible that there will ever again be a jihad that is lawfully declared according to the strict letter of the law, and there are no living descendants of lawful slaves, which means that legal enslavement is unthinkable. Islamic law recognises slavery as an institution within society, and attempts to regulate and restrict it in various ways. Different Islamic legal schools differ in their interpretation of Islamic law on slavery. Local customs in Muslim lands also affected the way slaves were treated. In the merchant cities of South-East Asia the sharia helped forge a legal distinction between slave and non-slave unknown in the rural hinterland. More frequently, however, the application of the sharia outside the Middle East was tempered by local customs. This allowed Muslims in regions as distant as Somalia, India and Indonesia to argue for the maintenance of pre-Islamic and other local structures of slavery even if these ran counter to the prescriptions of the sharia. Gwyn Campbell; Frank Cass, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 2004 Islamic law clearly recognises that slaves are human beings, but it frequently treats slaves as if they are property, laying down regulations covering the buying and selling of slaves. It encourages the freeing of slaves, which has the good effect of diminishing the slave population of a culture and, paradoxically, the bad effect of encouraging those whose livelihood depends on slave labour to find new ways of acquiring slaves. Who can be enslaved Under Islamic law people can only be legally enslaved in two circumstances: as the result of being defeated in a war that was legal according to sharia if they are born as the child of two slave parents Other legal systems of the time allowed people to be enslaved in a far wider range of circumstances. The sharia limits were often either ignored or evaded, and many instances of slave trading by Muslims were in fact illegal, but tolerated. The following groups of people cannot be made slaves: Free Muslims, but note that: Slaves who convert to Islam are not automatically freed Children born to legally enslaved Muslims are also slaves Slaves must not be mistreated or overworked, but should be treated well Slaves may take legal action for a breach of these rules, and may be freed as a result Slaves can get married if their owner consents Slaves may undertake business on the owner's behalf Slaves guilty of crimes can only be given half the punishment that would be given to a non-slave (although some schools of Islamic law do allow the execution of a slave who commits murder) A female slave cannot be separated from her child while it is under 7 years old Female slaves cannot be forced into prostitution Islamic law allows slaves to get their freedom under certain circumstances. It divides slaves with the right to freedom into various classes: The mukatab: a slave who has the contractual right to buy their freedom over time The mudabbar: a slave who will be freed when their owner dies (this might not happen if the owner's estate was too small) The umm walid, a female slave who had borne her owner a child Owners are allowed to have sex with their female slaves Slaves cannot carry out some religious roles Slaves can have only limited authority Slaves cannot be witnesses in court Killing a slave does not carry the death penalty in most schools of Islamic law Slaves are punishable under Islamic law if they commit a crime - although for some major crimes they only receive half the punishment of free people  The Prophet Muhammad did not try to abolish slavery, and bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves himself. But he insisted that slave owners treat their slaves well and stressed the virtue of freeing slaves. There are two different ways of interpreting this: some modern writers believe that Muhammad intended his teachings to lead to the gradual end of slavery by limiting opportunities to acquire new slaves and allowing existing slaves to become free. This idea doesn't appear in early writings. others writers argue that by regulating slavery the Prophet gave his authority to its continued existence, and that by having slaves himself he showed his approval Muhammad treated slaves as human beings and clearly held some in the highest esteem. For example, he personally ensured the freedom of Bilal, an African slave who had converted to Islam. Bilal was chosen as the first muezzin of Islam because of his beautiful voice. A muezzin is the person who calls the community to the daily prayers, and is a position of great prominence and responsibility. Zayd was a young boy who had grown up in the household of the Prophet as a slave, and remained with the household, almost as an adopted son, even after he was freed. He was amongst the first four people to adopt Islam. Indeed when Zayd's father (a wealthy nobleman) tracked his son down and offered to buy his freedom from Muhammad, Muhammad told Zayd that he was free to go with his father with no money changing hands, and to his father's astonishment Zayd chose to stay with Muhammad. In his lifetime the Prophet introduced the following rules about slavery: Stated that freeing slaves was the act that God found most acceptable Zakat (charity - the third Pillar of Islam) was often used by the state to free slaves Stated that freeing a slave was the appropriate way to gain forgiveness for certain wrongs Ordered that those who committed certain wrongs should be penalised by having to free their slaves Stated that slaves should be allowed to buy their freedom, and if necessary should be given the opportunity to earn money, or be lent money by the state, in order to do so Allowed slaves to be freed in certain circumstances Stated that slaves' contracts should be interpreted in favour of the slaves Stated that the duty of kindness towards slaves was the same of that towards family, neighbours and others Stated that when a slave owner had a child with a female slave, the child should be freed and could inherit from their father like any other child (as in the case of Ibrahim) There are a number of hadith that show that the Prophet treated slaves well and expected others to do the same... He will not enter Paradise who behaveth ill to his slaves. The Companions said, 'O Apostle of God! have you not told us, that there will be a great many slaves and orphans amongst your disciples?' He said, 'Yes; then be kind to them as to your own children, and give them to eat what you eat yourselves. The slaves that say their prayers are your brothers. Be kind to slaves as to your own children...and those that say their prayers are your brethren. They (slaves or servants) are your brothers, and Allah has put them under your command. So the one under whose hand Allah has put his brother, should feed him of what he eats, and give him dresses of what he wears, and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity. And if at all he asks him to do a hard task, he should help him therein.' 'There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the Day of Judgement. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money'. Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari: ""The Prophet said, 'Give food to the hungry, pay a visit to the sick and release (set free) the one in captivity (by paying his ransom).'""  Slavery in Muslim cultures and the Atlantic slave trade Slavery in Muslim history lasted much longer than the Atlantic slave trade - although slavery had existed in many cultures long before Islam. The Muslim slave trade from Africa seems to have enslaved roughly similar numbers (estimates vary between 11 and 14 million Africans) to the Atlantic slave trade, and the transportation conditions endured by victims of the Eastern trade were probably just as horrible in their own way as those of the Atlantic slave trade. One poignant fact is that when the Atlantic slave trade was abolished the Eastern trade expanded, suggesting that for some Africans the abolition of the Atlantic trade didn't lead to freedom, but merely changed their slave destination. Slavery played a significant part in the history of Muslim civilisation, but it was a form of slavery that was inherently different from the 'slave trade' in that the Muslim concept of slavery regarded those enslaved as people who had some, albeit fewer, human rights that must be respected. What was notably different from the slavery of the western world, however, was the degree to which they [slaves] were protected by Muslim law. When the law was observed, their treatment was good. They might expect to marry and have families of their own, and they had a good chance of being freed. There were also built in avenues of escape. Gwyn Campbell; Frank Cass, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 2004 But even though slavery under Islam could be significantly less harsh that that of the Atlantic slave trade, both involved serious breaches of human rights and restricted liberty. However well they were treated the slaves still had restricted freedom, and when the law was not obeyed their lives could be very unpleasant. The relationship between slave and master in Islam is a very different relationship from that between the American plantation labourer and owner. It was a much more personalized relationship and relatively benevolent. Everything here is relative -- being a slave is being a slave and it shouldn't be romanticized. Here are some of the main differences between Muslim slavery and the Atlantic slave trade: The Atlantic trade lasted from the 15th to 19th centuries, the Eastern trade from the 7th or 9th century to the 20th Under Islam slaves were considered people first, and then property. In the Atlantic trade slaves were considered property not people, and often just regarded as units of productive labour Islamic law laid down considerable protection for slaves; those taken for the Atlantic trade had very little protection Islamic law only permitted those conquered in legitimate warfare to be enslaved, all other methods being illegal - although this was often ignored - whereas the Atlantic trade enslaved anyone who had commercial value In Islam, slave-owners were forbidden to take young children from their mothers, something common in the Atlantic trade The owner-slave relationship could be kinder in Islam than in the Atlantic trade, and often more personal Islam recommends the freeing of slaves in itself as a 'good' religious act and says that slaves who convert to Islam should be freed. Zakat (the requirement for charity) was used by Muslim states to free slaves. There were many other avenues whereby a slave could be freed, for example as expiation for irregularities in other religious rituals; as a result many more slaves were freed than in the Atlantic trade Under Islamic law a slave could take his/her master to the Islamic courts to address a grievance, and the judge had the right to grant freedom against the master's wishes and/or other compensations; there was no such protection for slaves taken by the Atlantic trade Islam permitted slaves to attain high office; those taken for the Atlantic trade stayed at the bottom of society In the Atlantic trade there were two males to every female; in the Islamic trade, there were two females to every male Islam permitted women to be enslaved for sexual purposes, although not for prostitution Africans were enslaved in the Atlantic trade to work on an industrial scale in agricultural labour; in the Islamic trade they had a far wider variety of roles The Atlantic trade only involved black Africans; Muslim slavery involved many racial groups Slavery in the Atlantic trade was highly racist, something prohibited in Islam where there was much less institutionalised racism. Both masters and slaves had a wide range of colours and backgrounds; the result is that former slaves became absorbed into the Islamic world, while former slaves remained a discriminated-against underclass in the USA until comparatively recently The nature of the Atlantic trade and therefore the survival of racism in the West has been one of segregation. There wasn't this separation in Islam. Whites didn't push blacks off the pavement. They didn't forbid restaurants to serve them. I don't think that there's any disputing that slavery was a more benevolent institution in Islam than it was in the West.  Something particular to Islamic slave systems was the creation of a slave elite in some Muslim societies that allowed individuals to achieve considerable status, and even power and wealth, while still remaining in some form of 'enslavement'. The slave elite had enormous value to their Muslim masters because they were a military and administrative group made up of 'outsiders' who didn't have tribal and family allegiances that could conflict with their loyalty to their masters. It was believed that a corps of highly trained slaves loyal only to the ruler and dependent entirely on his good will would serve the state more reliably and efficiently than a hereditary nobility, whose interests might compete with those of the ruler. Leslie P. Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, 1993 Elite slavery is something of a paradox: how can a person have power and hold high office and yet still keep the status of a slave? One answer is that the slave gets authority and high office because they are dependant on the person who gives them their authority and status and who could remove that status if they chose. Thus elite slaves must give total loyalty and obedience to their master in order to maintain their privileges. Another view is that the slave who achieves elite status is no longer really a slave, and is able to use their position and power to free themselves of many of the limitations of slavery. This is less convincing since even elite slaves are at risk of losing their privileged status until they break free completely. The dependency was not all one way - the masters in many ways relied on their elite slaves, because those slaves were the only people they could really trust. And there was another reason why elite slaves were valuable - precisely because they were slaves, the elite slaves were free of some of the restrictions that limited free people, and this allowed them to do things for their masters that their masters could not otherwise achieve. Two examples of elite slavery were the Mamluks and the Devshirme system. The Mamluk system became firmly established in the Abbasid Empire during the 9th century. The Mamluks were 'slave soldiers' who eventually came to rule Egypt for over two centuries from 1250 until overthrown by the Ottomans in the 16th century. After a brief period of oppression the Mamluks were able, once again, to play a significant role in running the country. Mamluks were originally soldiers captured in Central Asia, but later boys aged 12-14 were specifically taken or bought to be trained as slave soldiers. Their slave status was shown by the name 'Mamluk' which means 'owned'. Although the Mamluks were not free men (they could not, for example, pass anything on to their children) they were elite slaves who were held in high regard as professional soldiers loyal to their Islamic masters. Historians have been fascinated by the uniqueness of the Mamluk phenomenon. It was inhuman in some respects (for example, Mamluks being denied the opportunity to bequeath their positions and privileges to their sons), yet it provided Islam with a superb military force and a sophisticated political system. In 13th century Egypt loyalty to the masters dissolved and the Mamluks established themselves as the ruling dynasty. Once the Mamluks had successfully revolted against their masters they were, of course, no longer slaves. They remained in power for the period 1250-1517. The basic ideal of military slavery - the Mamluk's total loyalty to his master who had bought, trained, maintained and freed him - was a pillar of Mamluk society in Ottoman Egypt, as it had been in the Mamluk Sultanate. When the master decided that his Mamluk had reached maturity and was ready to assume an office, he set him free, and 'allowed him to grow his beard.' He was now a free man, no longer dependent. The master often appointed these former slaves to army posts, to the beylicate [the beys were high ranking emirs who held important positions in Egyptian government], or to the regimental command. Very often, the master decided whom his former slave would marry, a decision which could advance the Mamluk socially and financially. The devshirme system introduced in the 14th century compelled non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire to hand over some of their children to be converted to Islam and work as slaves. Some writers say that between half a million to one million people were enslaved in this way over the centuries. Conquered Christian communities, especially in the Balkans, had to surrender twenty percent of their male children to the state. Some of these were trained for government service, where they were able to reach very high ranks, even that of Grand Vezir. Many of the others served in the elite military corps of the Ottoman Empire, called the Janissaries, which was almost exclusively made up of forced converts from Christianity. The devshirme played a key role in Sultan Mehmet's conquest of Constantinople, and from then on regularly held very senior posts in the imperial administration. Although members of the devshirme class were technically slaves, they were of great importance to the Sultan because they owed him their absolute loyalty and became vital to his power. This status enabled some of the 'slaves' to become both powerful and wealthy. Their status remained restricted, and their children were not permitted to inherit their wealth or follow in their footsteps. Not all writers agree that the devshirme system was beneficial as well as oppressive, and point out that many Christian families were hostile and resentful about it - which is perhaps underlined by the use of force to impose the system. The devshirme system continued until the end of the seventeenth century. Male slaves who had had their sexual organs removed were called eunuchs, and played an important part in some Muslim societies (as they did in some other cultures). They had the advantage for their masters of not being subject to sexual influence, and as they were unlikely to marry, they had no family ties to hinder their devotion to duty. Eunuch slavery involved compulsory mutilation, which usually took place between the ages of 8 and 12. Without modern medical skills and anaesthetics this was painful, and often led to fatal complications, and sometimes to physical or psychological problems for those who survived the operation. Eunuchs had a particular role as guardians of the harem and were the main way in which the women of the harem had contact with the world outside. In the Ottoman Empire eunuchs from Africa held considerable power from the mid sixteenth century to the eighteenth. It's recorded that the Ottoman family owned 194 eunuchs as late as 1903, of whom 35 'bore a title of some seniority'.  Concubinage may be defined as the more or less permanent cohabitation (outside the marriage bond) of a man with a woman or women, whose position would be that of secondary wives, women bought, acquired by gift, captured in war, or domestic slaves. Muslim cultures are thought to have had more female slaves than male slaves. Enslaved women were given many tasks and one of the most common was working as a domestic servant. But some female slaves were forced to become sex workers: not prostitutes, as this is forbidden in Islam, but concubines. Concubines were women who were sexually available to their master, but not married to him. A Muslim man could have as many concubines as he could afford. Concubinage was not unique to Islam; the Bible records that King Solomon and King David both had concubines, and it is recorded in other cultures too. Being a concubine did have some benefits: if a slave woman gave birth to her owner's child, her status improved dramatically - she could not be sold or given away, and when her owner died she became free. The child was also free and would inherit from their father as any other children. Concubinage was not prostitution in the commercial sense both because that was explicitly forbidden and because only the owner could legitimately have sex with a female slave; anyone else who had sex with her was guilty of fornication. Concubines lived in the harem, an area of the household where women lived separately from men. The nature of Ottoman harems is described by Ehud R Toledano: The harem system grew out of the need in Ottoman society to achieve gender segregation and limit women's accessibility to men who did not belong to their family. Households were divided into two separate sections: the selamlik, housing the male members, and the haremlik, where the women and children dwelt. At the head of the women's part reigned the master's mother or his first wife (out of a maximum of four wives allowed by Islam). The concubines were also part of the harem, where all the attendants were women. Male guests of the master were not entertained in the harem. An active and well-developed social network linked harems of similar status across Ottoman towns and villages; mutual visits and outdoor excursions were common. For the women who actually spent their lives in the harems, reality was, of course, far more mixed and complicated. The women who came into the harem as slaves (câriyes) were taught and trained to be ""ladies,"" learning all the domestic and social roles attached to that position. As they grew up, they would be paired with the men of the family either as concubines or as legal wives. However, harem slaves' freedom of choice was rather limited, as was that of women in general in an essentially male-dominated environment. Harem slaves frequently had to endure sexual harassment from male members of the family. Ehud R. Toledano, Slavery and Abolition in the Ottoman Middle East, 1998 Writers disagree over the nature of concubinage and the harem: Some argue that it was seriously wrong in that it was just slavery women could be bought and sold, or given as gifts it involved compulsory non-consensual sex - which would nowadays be called 'rape' it reinforced male power in the culture Others say that it was relatively benign, because it gave female slaves a chance to gain their freedom A balanced view might be to say that sexual slavery in this context was a very bad thing, but that it was possible for some of the more fortunate victims to gain benefits that provided some degree of compensation. Concubines could play an important political role and have considerable direct political influence on the policy of the state. More than any other Muslim dynasty, the Ottomans raised the practice of slave concubinage to a reproductive principle: after the generations of Osman and Orhan, virtually all offspring of the sultans appear to have been born of concubine mothers. Leslie P. Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, 1993 The benefit to the state, or at least to the ruling dynasty, of having the ruling line born through concubines rather than wives was that only one family was involved - the family of a concubine was irrelevant, but the family of a wife would expect to gain power and influence through their relationship to the mother of the son. These conflicting interests could threaten the succession and weaken the ruling family. (This didn't eliminate conflict between heirs and families altogether, but it probably reduced it.) Concubines as well as wives also played an important role in strengthening cohesion, stability, and continuity at household level too, as this remark about 18th century Cairo demonstrates: Marital and nonmarital unions strengthened the links among men; women legitimized the succession of men to power, and women's property ownership added to the overall wealth, prestige, and power of a household. Mary Ann Fay, From Concubines to Capitalists: Women, Property, and Power in Eighteenth-century Cairo, Journal of Women's History, 1998 And later in the same article the writer describes the inevitable tension inherent in the status of harem women in that society: However, the harem was not a prison; it was instead the family quarters of an upper-class home which became exclusively female space when men not related to the women were in the house and whose entry into the harem was forbidden. Women, heavily veiled, could and did leave their homes... ... Women were not imprisoned in the harem or in the veils and cloaks that concealed their bodies and faces on the street, but both customs were important signifiers of women's lack of sexual autonomy and of men's control over the selection of women's sexual and marital partners. In the economic sphere, however, women had a great deal of autonomy... ... Therefore, the eighteenth-century Egyptian household should not be seen as the site of unrelieved oppression of women but rather in terms of asymmetries of power between men and women. Mary Ann Fay, From Concubines to Capitalists: Women, Property, and Power in Eighteenth-century Cairo, Journal of Women's History, 1998 In the Ottoman Empire the sale of woman as slaves continued until 1908.  Muslims and the abolition of slavery Slavery remained part of the fabric of Islam for over 1200 years (although the Druze, a group that sprung from Muslim roots, abolished it in the 11th century). While slavery was in theory greatly limited by Islamic law, in practice it persisted on a large scale in Muslim lands. During the 20th century attitudes to slavery changed radically and in 1990 The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam stated that: Human beings are born free, and no one has the right to enslave, humiliate, oppress or exploit them, and there can be no subjugation but to God the Most-High. The Declaration also includes a number of other articles that are incompatible with slavery, although ""All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Shari'ah"". Since slavery is permitted by Islamic law, Muslim countries have used secular law to ban it. Some countries outlawed slavery only comparatively recently: The idea that slavery should be abandoned began to be seriously discussed in the 16th century. The Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556-1605) banned the slave trade in his Indian territory. The Muslim leader and reformer Nasr al-Din denounced slavery to the people of Senegal in the 1670s and banned the sale of slaves to Christians there, undermining the French trade in slaves. In some countries, slaves who held high rank demonstrated that slaves were perfectly capable of playing any role in society if they were freed. Egypt had even been ruled by a slave dynasty for more than a century. These traditions slowly changed some Muslim thinking about slavery, and gradually created a climate in which the pressure for abolition could build. But serious abolition for the Muslim world had to wait until the 19th century. Because slavery was accepted by Islamic law it would have been difficult or impossible to forbid slavery itself, so the abolition pressure was concentrated on the transportation of slaves, including the slave markets, which was where the worst cruelties were to be found. Islam forbade raids to gain slaves, making a slave out of a free person and other cruelties. So Muslim abolitionists focused on showing slave trading was illegal under Islamic law, knowing that if they could stop the trade in slaves, slavery itself would slowly die out from lack of supply. For the same reason, colonial powers attacked the trade in slaves as much as the institution of slavery. The slave trade in Muslim societies ended not so much through a single act of abolition but by withering away as the result of external and internal pressure. The outside pressure came from colonial powers that had only recently abandoned slavery themselves: Colonial powers such as Britain and France applied great pressure for the abolition of slavery in their dominions. This pressure was successful in some places, like Egypt, but much less influential in others. Colonial powers also took direct action against slave traders: the British Navy played a role in intercepting and taking action against slave traders, and between 1817 and 1890 signed treaties with over 80 territories allowing them to do this. Internal pressure came from a variety of Muslim sources: From the 1870s, radical and gradual rationalists, together with moderate literalists and progressive ulama, could all be placed in the broad category of opponents of slavery, despite their manifold disagreements. William G. Clarence-Smith, Religions and the abolition of slavery - a comparative approach Muslim abolitionists were influenced by factors like these: The abolition of the Atlantic slave trade provided an enlightening example Some Muslim thinkers saw slavery as colonialist/imperialist behaviour that was incompatible with growing anti-colonialism Some Muslim thinkers regarded slavery as an activity incompatible with the modern world Changes in culture brought about by factors such as urbanisation, changes in the demand for labour, education, a desire to relate to Western nations as equals An increase in the freeing of slaves in some territories helped to accustom people to the ending of slavery The result of these forces was to shrink the slave trade, and put pressure on slavery itself. Initially, it was a source of great hostility that the West dared to intervene in Islamic affairs in contradiction to what was allowed by the Koran. But as Western influence, or modernism, became more and more [widespread], it became less fashionable as well as profitable in Islam to own slaves. And it became illegal over much of the area. The pressures against slavery were extremely great from Western powers. It was the moral issue. It became more scandalous because the conditions of procurement and transport became more and more horrendous. The Ottoman Empire was the major Muslim slave society of the abolition period, and it abolished the slave trade in stages. Although the Ottomans never abolished slavery itself, their policy of restricting the slave trade and increasing opportunities for slaves to get their freedom greatly reduced the number of slaves in its territories: 1867: Programme introduced to help slaves from Russia get their freedom 1887-1880: Conventions against the slave trade signed with Britain Slavery was harder to outlaw in areas far from central government where tribal traditions had been less influenced by the factors above, and where the military power of the centre was much weaker. The slavers retreated into these areas, and moved their slaves to market more secretly. Quite a few of the anti-slavery military initiatives ended in victory for the slavers rather than the forces of abolition. Some other Muslim countries passed laws allowing for the prosecution not only of the sellers of slaves but the buyers too. The Indian Slavery Act of 1844 made slavery illegal there, and Egypt in 1896 implemented laws with very severe penalties for slaving activities. The British felt that they had a mission to do this - as can be seen from this Foreign Office document of 1861: Captain Hamerton should take every opportunity of impressing upon these Arabs that the nations of Europe are destined to put an end to the African Slave Trade, and that Great Britain is the main instrument in the Hands of Providence for the accomplishment of this purpose. That it is in vain for these Arabs to endeavour to resist the consummation of that which is written in the Book of Fate, and that they ought to bow to superior power, to leave off a pursuit which is doomed to annihilation, and a perseverance in which will only involve them in losses and other evils. The British action did not gain universal support. The Sultan of Zanzibar wrote to the British Consul: If I put a stop to the traffic in slaves it will ruin these countries, and it will ruin my subjects; and I am sure that the British Government would never agree to this; my friend, it is in my wish to comply with all the desires of the British Government but these countries cannot do without slaves. For the British Government is far off, and does not know the circumstances of these countries."
462,"A professional footballer has been found guilty of murdering a man on a north-west London estate.  Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant, 26, shot dead Leon Labastide on the Stonebridge Park Estate in Harlesden in 2004, the Old Bailey was told.  Grant, who also played for Wycombe Wanderers and Bradford City, was involved in a series of ""tit-for-tat"" shootings on the estate, jurors heard.  Grant, who had denied murder, is due to be sentenced on Monday.  Gareth Downie, 25, from Markby Road, Birmingham, was also found guilty of murdering Mr Labastide.  And Damian Williams, 32, from Tower Bridge Road in Southwark, was convicted of conspiring with them to murder Mr Labastide.  The court heard that Mr Labastide's killing led to the murder of Jahmall Moore in 2005 and Grant's arrest.  Grant, from Shrewsbury Avenue, Kenton, north-west London, was later cleared of shooting Mr Moore, 22, who died in a hail of bullets fired by three gunmen.  He had also denied involvement in Mr Labastide's killing, claiming the 21-year-old was a friend, but was found guilty of murder following trials in December and this month.  Jurors heard trouble flared after a burglary in which three women were terrorised and it was suspected that £20,000 in drug money was taken.  A 16-year-old girl, who had been in the house, gave evidence under an assumed name.  Mr Labastide was rumoured to have been behind the burglary and Williams arranged for Grant and Downie to shoot him, the court was told.  Officers from Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime in the black community, believe as a result of the burglary there were up to 30 connected shooting incidents in the area.  Following the arrests of Grant and others, officers said shootings fell by almost 50% in the area.  Det Insp Steve Horsley said: ""Gavin Grant thought he had got away with murder.  ""He carried on his footballing career while, all along, he had blood on his hands.""  During the trial, Prosecutor Stephen Batten QC said many of the people involved in the case had been linked to shootings and drug dealing on the estate.  He said: ""Attitudes and standards are different. It is more the law of the jungle than the law of civilised England.""  Roberto Parchment, 24, originally convicted of Mr Moore's murder, was found guilty again following a retrial in December.  He was jailed for life again and ordered to serve the remainder of his 28-year sentence.  Downie and Williams will also be sentenced on Monday."
463,"Across the world, Glasgow is known for its shipbuilding.  But a century ago, the yards building Britain's mighty merchant navy were not in Glasgow at all.  They were in Govan and Partick - which at that time were independent burghs down river of the city centre.  But Glasgow had long-held ambitions to annex its neighbours and create a much larger city.  Several attempts dating back to the 1870s had failed in parliament, but by 1911 things were getting critical, and it sponsored the Glasgow Boundaries Bill before parliament.  The census that year revealed Glasgow's population was 784,496, larger than any city outside of London.  But Birmingham, which had a population of just 525,960 had recently incorporated the borough of Aston, to take its total to more than 800,000.  ""The creation of a greater Glasgow would reclaim the proud position of Glasgow as the Second City of the Empire, which is in danger of being lost,"" said a report to the Lord Provost.  The city relied on economic arguments to strengthen its case before Westminster.  ""If it had not been for the enterprise of the City in deepening the River Clyde at tremendous cost, there would have been neither shipbuilding yards nor docks for the population of Govan to be employed in,"" Glasgow's counsel told the parliamentary committee examining the bill.  A former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Dr Michael Kelly says amalgamation made economic sense.  ""There were businessmen - entrepreneurs in the city of Glasgow,"" he said.  ""And there were manufacturers outwith that, say in the shipyards for example, which would be in Govan.  ""So it was very important to co-ordinate the supply of services plus the giving of planning permissions and the laying out of a broader plan, an industrial plan for the city. ""  Neither Partick nor Govan was interested in losing its independence; nor was the small southside burgh of Pollokshaws, which was also targeted by Glasgow.  Following an anti-amalgamation demonstration, The Govan Post reported: ""The meeting in the Govan Town Hall was attended by many hundreds of the ratepayers who have an interest in the burgh of Govan; who have also taken a deep interest in the progress, and watched with pride its growing assets and sound financial position.""  It added: ""They are determined that this shall not be handed away, and the independence of our burgh will be fought for to the end.""  But the working class of Govan, the 7th largest burgh in Scotland were bought by promises of cheaper power.  Glasgow Corporation supplied electricity, gas and water to the other burghs, and claimed, for instance Govan residents would pay 9d in the £1 less on stair lighting charges.  The saving for Partick would be 7½d and for Pollokshaws, 7 3/4d.  According to Colin Quigley, a volunteer for the Govan local history group, the Fairfield Heritage Project, it was a persuasive argument.  ""I think it primarily came down to taxes,"" he said.  ""Glasgow was offering the working man what was called differential rates in taxes, which meant they would have paid a lot less.  ""Business owners and the more affluent in Govan would have suffered - they would have actually paid more. So I think the division fell down the line of class.""  Glasgow also offered Govan a new hall, library, washhouses and public baths to the value of £40,000; Partick was promised even more - £50,000 worth of civic projects.  Even little Pollokshaws would get a new swimming pool and recreation grounds.  This raised the anger of the Ratepayers' Federation which gave evidence to parliament.  ""The most pressing problem in Glasgow at the present is not annexation of green fields and well-administered burghs, but the extermination of the slums, with their attendant crime and misery which are a greater menace to the health of the community than any other factor.""  But a massive petition was sent to the House of Lords from Govan in favour of amalgamation. Virtually all of its signatories were working class men.  So on 7 August 1912, the Glasgow Boundaries Act passed into law, largely creating the city we see today."
464,"The Houses of Parliament could have to be ""abandoned"" within 20 years without extensive repair work, Commons Speaker John Bercow has said.  The Grade I-listed building suffers from flooding, contains a great deal of asbestos and has fire safety issues.  In a speech in Westminster, Mr Bercow said a £3bn repair bill was a ""realistic scenario"".  If MPs and peers were to temporarily move out, locations outside London should be considered, he added.  The Palace of Westminster - containing the House of Commons and House of Lords - is a Grade I-listed building much of which dates back to the 1840s and 1850s.  Much of it has never been renovated, and the heating, water, draining and electrical systems are described as ""extremely antiquated"".  A study in 2012 concluded ""irreversible damage"" would be done without extensive renovation work. Among the options put forward to carry out the work was a temporary closure, with MPs and peers meeting in an alternative venue.  Speaking at an event organised by the Hansard Society, Mr Bercow said the ""fabulous institution"" must not ""have the ethos of a museum"".  ""It will require bold and imaginative managerial leadership to ensure that we are a Parliament fit for purpose and that this Victorian legacy can be rendered practical for contemporary representation,"" he said.  Mr Bercow said it would be a ""huge pity"" if by the 200th anniversary of the fire that destroyed the old Palace of Westminster in 1834, ""we had to abandon this site and look elsewhere in order to serve the public interest properly"".  He added: ""Yet I will tell you in all candour that unless management of the very highest quality and a not inconsequential sum of public money are deployed on this estate over the next 10 years that will be the outcome.""  Taking questions afterwards, Mr Bercow said he was ""very uneasy"" about ""decanting"" Parliament to another building while repairs are carried out since ""once you are out it can be very difficult to get back"".  But he added: ""If we were to decant, should we consider all options including, almost certainly, a regional option? We should.""  Any decisions would have to be made by the whole House of Commons, Mr Bercow said, while the sums of money involved would require government funding.  Lib Dem MP John Thurso, chair of the House of Commons Commission, said the Palace of Westminster was ""really in a dire condition"" and it was a ""distinct possibility"" that MPs and peers would have to move out while it was refurbished.  ""There are very serious problems throughout the Palace,"" he told Radio 4's World at One programme.  ""Simply patching it up to the minimal cost each year is no longer a viable option.""  While no-one yet knew what the work would cost, he said he believed there would be ""an outcry"" if such an iconic building was demolished or left to go to seed.  The present building has had no general renovation since repairs of wartime damage were carried out between 1945 and 1950."
465,"Entertainer Michael Barrymore has admitted possessing cocaine that was found in his pocket after police approached his car in London.  Barrymore, 59, was detained in the early hours of 22 November after his Citroen DS3 hit a kerb in Acton.  The former host of programmes like Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People was fined a total of £780 at Ealing Magistrates' Court.  A charge of being drunk and disorderly was withdrawn at the hearing.  Barrymore, born Michael Parker, was held after officers on routine patrol noticed damage to the Citroen, at the junction of The Vale and Dordrecht Road.  The court heard he swore at officers during an angry rant, saying: ""Don't you think I've had enough... from you lot over the years?  After he was arrested he was seen trying to conceal a white substance in his mouth, prosecutor Sally Peters said.  A small white rock was found in his trouser pocket and Barrymore tested positive for cocaine at a police station.  He was told the fine would have been higher had he not pleaded guilty.  Barrymore's lawyer, Richard Gowthorpe, said he only had a ""a very small amount"" of the drug and apologised to police for his behaviour.  ""In many ways it's a sad day for Mr Parker to be before the courts and he's pleaded guilty to this offence,"" said Mr Gowthorpe.  ""Certainly he will be punished to a degree by the conviction itself.  ""This behaviour is wholly out of character. This is not part of a general lifestyle that Mr Parker is living.""  Mr Gowthorpe told the court Barrymore is no longer using drugs and had sought help after the incident, with which he was making ""very good progress"".  ""It's something Mr Parker has found very helpful and is willing to engage further in that process.  ""I would say Mr Parker is doing everything he can do address the issues.""  Barrymore was also said to be receiving treatment for alcoholism."
466,"DNA analysis of the spotted cats found that they were serial cheaters, with nearly half of their litters made up of cubs from different fathers.  Writing in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the scientists say the infidelity may expose them to disease.  However, it could also ensure the genetic diversity of the endangered species, the researchers hypothesise.  ""If the cubs are genetically more variable it may allow them to adapt and evolve to different circumstances,"" Dada Gottelli of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and one of the scientists on the study told the BBC News website.  ""If there is a big change in the environment some may be able to cope better.""  Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are classified as a vulnerable species according to the World Conservation Union (IUCN).  The effective breeding population is estimated to be below 10,000 individuals and the species faces threats including habitat loss and poaching.  The new research tracked known cheetahs in the Serengeti National Park in north-west Tanzania over nine years.  Analysis of DNA collected from the faecal samples of 176 cheetahs showed that infidelity was rife, although uncommon in other big cats.  Of 47 litters of cubs, 43% contained cubs from multiple fathers. In some cases, three males were responsible for the cubs of just one litter.  ""If anything, this is an underestimate,"" said Ms Gotelli. ""Cheetah cubs suffer high mortality on the first few weeks so it was difficult to get samples from all of them.""  Female cheetahs are able to successfully mate with multiple males as they produce a new egg each time they mate, a process known as induced ovulation  Common in domestic cats and other species such as rabbits, it means that each egg can in theory be fertilised by sperm from a different male.  The high incidence of promiscuity among females coupled with the fact that they increase their risk of predation, parasites and disease to mate with multiple males suggests that there must be a benefit to the behaviour.  The researchers believe the evolutionary pay-off is increased genetic diversity, allowing some of the cubs to more readily adapt to change.  This is good news for conservationists trying to preserve the threatened species as small populations of animals can face problems of inbreeding.  However, the duplicitous behaviour may also bring other benefits such as protecting the cubs from marauding males.  ""Infanticide has not been observed in the wild cheetahs, like it has been in lions and leopards,"" said Ms Gotelli. ""Maybe this is why.  ""It may create confusion in the males. In that case it's better not to kill any cubs in case they were yours."""
467,"Six-year-old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez - at the centre of an international custody dispute - is a step closer to being returned to his father in Cuba after a long-awaited court ruling. A US judge on Tuesday dismissed a petition by his Miami relatives seeking a political asylum hearing for the boy. Elian's father - and the Cuban authorities - want him back in Cuba, while emigre family members in Florida want him to remain in the US. The boy was shipwrecked off Miami last November during an illegal attempt to reach the US. Elian's mother and 10 other would-be emigres died in the accident, while Elian and two other survivors came ashore clinging to the wreckage.    The asylum application was the latest legal attempt by Elian's relatives in Florida to block moves by the US immigration authorities to return him to Cuba. The family in Miami argued that Elian would face immediate psychological and physical harm if repatriated. Judge Michael Moore ruled that he had jurisdiction over the case, and that the relatives had legal standing to bring the petition to court. But he dismissed the petition on its merits, ruling that Attorney-General Janet Reno must make the final decision on Elian's case - the position which has been held by the US Government from the start of the case.    Later on Tuesday, Ms Reno said it was time for the boy to be returned to Cuba. ""It is time for this little boy who has been through so very much to move on with life at his father's side,"" she said. The attorney-general said that the judge's ruling ""reaffirms our position that only Elian's father can speak for his son on federal immigration matters."" ""The court also recognised the importance of family reunification and protecting the bond between the son and his sole surviving parent,"" she said. A lawyer acting for Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, has said he is ready to appeal against the decision. Though it is possible that the appeal will overturn Judge Moore's ruling, legal experts in Miami say the most critical step in any battle of this kind is to win the opening round, as the government has done. The government insists that the boy's place is with his father, who remains in Cuba. The Miami relatives have said they would appeal against an unfavourable court ruling. ""We must analyse with serenity and calm the apparently positive news, without underestimating the obstacles and difficulties we still need to overcome in order to achieve the kidnapped boy's return to Cuba,"" a government statement said."
468,"Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier was back at Anfield to see his side qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals with a magnificent performance.  An early Jari Litmanen penalty and a second-half header from Emile Heskey were enough to give the English side victory over Roma.  And with Barcelona taking all three points in a 1-0 win at Galatasaray, it is the clubs from England and Spain who qualify from Group B.  Houllier was given a rapturous welcome on his first appearance at an Anfield game for five months following heart surgery. And Liverpool got the perfect start as Litmanen - in for the injured Michael Owen - scored from the penalty spot in the sixth minute. The first corner of the night caused panic in the Roma defence and Marcos Assuncao impeded Danny Murphy as the Liverpool midfielder was poised to shoot. Litmanen calmly stroked the penalty into the bottom left-hand corner, and Liverpool immediately set about doubling the advantage. Moments later Steven Gerrard struck a fierce free-kick from 25 yards that Franceso Antonioli did well to parry.  Liverpool flooded forward, with John Arne Riise and Heskey going close as Roma could only manage brief raids out of their own half. Gabriel Batistuta went closest for the visitors in the 35th minute but he failed to connect from inside the six yard box from a corner. Liverpool's dominance was embodied by the energetic Gerrard, who went in at half time needing attention after a challenge with Aldair sent him crashing into the hoardings. Roma boss Fabio Capello brought Marco Delvecchio and Vicenzo Montella on for Batistuta and Lima after the break, and the Italians soon picked up their game.  A smart move inside the Liverpool box ended with Francesco Totti going desperately close - his shot from six yards deflecting wide of the post. The match remained in the balance with chances at either end, Candela heading over in the 58th minute and a Riise shot seconds later stretching Antonioli at the other end. The decisive moment came in the 63rd minute when Damiano Tommasi was booked for pulling back Litmanen. The yellow card proved less significant than the free kick, as Heskey climbed highest to power Murphy's flighted ball into the bottom corner. Roma pushed forward in search of a lifeline, but despite the efforts of Totti they could only create half chances and failed to trouble Dudek in the closing stages. Liverpool continued to look dangerous at the other end through Heskey and the impressive Riise. And with a two-goal cushion the home crowd did not need to wait for news from Turkey to begin celebrating on the final whistle."
469,"The Lebanese journalist and politician Ghassan Tueni has died aged 86.  Tueni, who was honorary president of the newspaper al-Nahar, had been receiving treatment at the American University of Beirut hospital.  He succeed his father as al-Nahar's editor-in-chief and publisher, serving from 1948 to 1999, and 2003 onwards.  Tueni also served several terms in parliament and as Lebanon's permanent representative to the UN between 1977 and 1982, at the peak of the civil war.  He is remembered for having told a meeting of the UN Security Council as he pushed for Resolution 425, which called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops: ""Let my people live!""  His son Gebran, who was also a politician and journalist and who was a vocal critic of Syria's domination of Lebanon, was killed in a car bomb attack in 2005, only months after the assassination of Rafik Hariri.  Ghassan Tueni's former brother-in-law, Marwan Hamadeh, a former Lebanese telecommunications minister, said he was ""one of the biggest champions of freedom of the press in Lebanon and the Arab world"".  ""He turned al-Nahar into a major independent newspaper in the Arab world at a time when no one dared outside Lebanon to write a word that did not glorify the leaders and autocrats of the region,"" Mr Hamadeh told the AFP news agency.  Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a statement: ""With the loss of Ghassan Tueni, Lebanon has lost one of its authentic national symbols.""  Al-Nahar was founded by Tueni's father, Gebran, in 1933."
470,"The poppy has a long association with Remembrance Day. But how did the distinctive red flower become such a potent symbol of our remembrance of the sacrifices made in past wars?  Scarlet corn poppies (popaver rhoeas) grow naturally in conditions of disturbed earth throughout Western Europe. The destruction brought by the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th Century transformed bare land into fields of blood red poppies, growing around the bodies of the fallen soldiers.  In late 1914, the fields of Northern France and Flanders were once again ripped open as World War One raged through Europe's heart. Once the conflict was over the poppy was one of the only plants to grow on the otherwise barren battlefields.  The significance of the poppy as a lasting memorial symbol to the fallen was realised by the Canadian surgeon John McCrae in his poem In Flanders Fields. The poppy came to represent the immeasurable sacrifice made by his comrades and quickly became a lasting memorial to those who died in World War One and later conflicts. It was adopted by The Royal British Legion as the symbol for their Poppy Appeal, in aid of those serving in the British Armed Forces, after its formation in 1921."
471,"Iraqi forces are advancing into the centre of Ramadi, after launching a major assault to drive Islamic State militants from the city, officials say.  Security sources told the BBC troops and allied tribesmen, backed by US-led air strikes, had already retaken two districts, and entered two others.  They are heading towards the main government complex, and have come up against snipers and suicide bombers.  Ramadi fell to IS in May in an embarrassing defeat for the Iraqi army.  Last month, government forces completed their encirclement of the predominantly Sunni Arab city, about 90km (55 miles) west of Baghdad, cutting off militants inside the centre from strongholds elsewhere in Anbar province and in neighbouring Syria.  Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service spokesman Sabah al-Numani said its troops, supported by soldiers, police and Sunni tribesmen, had begun the assault on central Ramadi at dawn and were advancing on the government complex.  ""We went into the centre of Ramadi from several fronts and we began purging residential areas,"" he told the AFP news agency.  ""The city will be cleared in the coming 72 hours.""  ""We did not face strong resistance - only snipers and suicide bombers, and this is a tactic we expected,"" he added.  Sources in the Iraqi military's Anbar Operations Command told the BBC that engineers had built temporary bridges over the River Euphrates, which flows along the north and west of the city centre. This had enabled troops to enter directly the al-Haouz district, south-west of the government complex.  By Tuesday afternoon, government forces had retaken the al-Thubat and al-Aramil districts, and entered nearby al-Malaab and Bakir, the sources said.  If the battle to recapture Ramadi succeeds, it will be the second-largest city after Tikrit to be taken back from the self-proclaimed Islamic State in the past 18 months. It would be a major boost for the morale of the Iraqi security forces and for those Sunnis opposing IS in Iraq.  That is not only because the city of Ramadi is predominantly Sunni and a key IS stronghold, but also because the forces fighting to take it back are spearheaded by Sunni tribesmen.  The Shia-dominated paramilitary force known as Popular Mobilisation (al-Hashd al-Shaabi) has been involved in many battles against IS, but the government has chosen not to deploy it in Ramadi.  The force was accused of human rights abuses against Sunnis after the recapture of Tikrit in April, and it is believed previous atrocities carried out by Shia militias helped alienate Sunnis and push them into the arms of IS.  A spokesman for the US-led coalition against IS, which carried out at least 12 air strikes in support of the offensive on Tuesday, said the fall of Ramadi was ""inevitable"", but warned that it would be a ""tough fight"".  Col Steve Warren suggested there were between 250 and 350 IS militants entrenched in the city centre, with some hundreds more to the north and west.  The Iraqi defence ministry said the jihadists had prevented civilians leaving Ramadi since leaflets warning of an assault were dropped over the city last month.  ""They plan to use them as human shields,"" spokesman Naseer Nuri told the Reuters news agency on Monday.  Col Warren said there were still thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of civilians inside Ramadi.  Sources inside Ramadi told the BBC IS had carried out a campaign of raids and mass arrests of residents in districts still under its control, in an attempt to prevent an uprising in support of the government offensive.  IS has lost control of several key towns in Iraq to government and Kurdish forces since overrunning large swathes of the country's west and north in June 2014 and proclaiming the creation of a ""caliphate"" that also extended into neighbouring Syria.  On Monday, analysis by IHS Jane's suggested that IS had lost 14% of its overall territory in Iraq and Syria, about 12,800 sq km (4,940 sq miles), over the past year.  Despite this, the group has been able to capture new territory of strategic value over the same period, including Ramadi and Palmyra in Syria's Homs province. It also still controls the Iraqi cities of Falluja, east of Ramadi, and Mosul, in the north.  A notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It adheres to its own extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death.  IS projects a powerful image, partly through propaganda and sheer brutality, and is the world's richest insurgent group. It has about 30,000 fighters but is facing daily bombing by a US-led multinational coalition which has vowed to destroy it."
472,"When events get under way at the London 2012 Games' main stadium, most people following the drama on the track might not be aware they are also seeing a cutting-edge piece of technology.  The track was designed and laid by Mondo, an Italian company that has provided all the tracks at the main Olympic stadiums since the 1992 Games in Barcelona.  Unlike other track designs that combine traction and shock-absorption in an upper layer of rubber granules, the Mondo track separates these functions, with a cushion backing for shock absorption and a solid upper layer that optimises slip resistance, traction and durability.  This design cuts the need for the spikes on athletes' running shoes to penetrate the running surface. Shoes used on tracks fitted by the Italian firm are considerably shorter and non-penetrating.  This means, the designers say, that less time and energy is lost going into the track and retracting the spikes afterwards.  Both the layers in the track are made of rubber, explains Joe Hoekstra, Mondo´s project manager for London 2012.  ""The two layers are vulcanized, a process which cross links the molecular structure of the different materials and makes the surface more uniform, stronger and elastic,"" he tells the BBC.  The cushioning on the underside of the track used to be in the form of square netting, designed to be flexible in the running direction only.  However, since the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the design has changed and the backing now has elongated diamond shaped cells.  ""The advantage of this design is that the cells flex easily in any direction, rather than just forwards, giving ideal cushioning while providing great material reaction time,"" Mr Hoekstra says.  Reaction time is a key concept. Fast reaction means the athlete gets their own energy back.  ""The material comes back quickly enough to act like a springboard underfoot providing more energy return and assisting the athlete into the next stride,"" he observes.  At the same time, the multi-directional flex also shortens the so-called rolling time, when the athlete's foot naturally rolls, on impact, from the 5th metatarsus (outside portion of the foot) to the 1st metatarsus (inside portion of the foot).  This reduction in rolling time means the overall contact time of the foot with the track is shortened, and the foot spends less time on the ground.  At the other end of the spectrum, a spongy material would deliver high shock absorption, but the material would only recover long after the athlete has moved on, giving them no energy return at all.  ""Some athletes say our track is not as soft as others, but softness does not always mean safety and better performance. A surface that yields too much will only produce fatigue, like running on sand,"" says Mr Hoestra.  Since the 90s lightweight ceramic spikes have replaced the old steel ones.  ""In the early 90s, when metal composites were first developed for the aerospace industry, companies like Omni-Lite began to see them as having commercial applications,"" says David Grant, chief executive of Omni-lite Industries.  The California-based company makes parts for the aerospace industry and holds the patent for ceramic spikes.  Since 1996, the firm has sold about 150 million of them.  ""Considering there are typically between 12 and 14 spikes in a shoe, that would be approximately 10 million shoes,"" estimates Mr Grant.  One of the main advantages of the composite spike is that its weight is one third that of a steel spike.  The US firm has worked closely with the Italian track designers, he adds.  ""We designed a spike to compress the track and hence the energy from that compression returns back to the athlete and is not absorbed by the track.""  Since the development of the ceramic spike, the technology has reached the point where specialised spikes made for Olympic athletes are now made from ""nano materials"".  ""Typically these are stronger and more wear resistant than the original lightweight spikes. These spikes were first utilised in Beijing and will be used in London,"" Mr Grants tells the BBC.  The Mondo-designed track at the London 2012 Olympic Stadium was tested by Labosport, one of the independent labs accredited with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).  Alastair Cox, director of Labosport, says that by setting track standards, the ""IAAF wants to ensure first of all that a record broken in London is as valid as one broken in Beijing or Sydney"".  He adds: ""Secondly, they want to ensure that the surface is suitable for all the events that will take place in the stadium.""  Mr Cox describes athletics as an unusual sport: ""It is not one activity like football or cricket where you are playing one single game.""  What would be an ideal surface for the 100 metres may not necessarily be so for the 10,000 metres.  ""Crudely speaking, the old idea was that the harder the surface the faster the surface, so a sprinter would like to be running almost on concrete because it gives him the greatest assistance to run quickly,"" Mr Cox explains.  ""But clearly, if you are a distance runner, running on a very hard solid surface has long-term implications from injury perspective.""  Labosport has made sure the London 2012 track complied with the set standards for shock absorption and degree of deformation.  The lab uses machines known as artificial athletes, which are basically mechanical simulations of the loading pattern of an athlete running on the surface.  ""We make sure it is not going to be too slippery when it is wet, but equally we need to ensure that friction is not too high and there is too much grip,"" he tells the BBC.  Apart from the main nine-lane 400-metre track, Mondo has also laid an 80-metre ""final-call"" sprint straight under the main stand, and a 400-metre warm-up track, identical to the competition one.  For athletes, experiencing the track is key, according to Joe Hoekstra.  ""Athletes need to consider the number and length of the spikes in relation, for example, to body weight, prevalent conditions (wet surfaces require more assistance in traction) and type of event,"" he says.  ""In general, field events like high jump and javelin require more traction, so the ideal shoes for these events have more spikes and they are longer"".  Shorter spikes minimise shock from the track for long distance athletes.  But Mr Hoekstra acknowledges that, ultimately, it comes down to personal preferences.  He says: ""In the same way a Formula One driver would not race without getting to know the track and choosing appropriate tyres, getting to know the track and choosing the right shoes for track and event is crucial.""  After years of research and innovation, the stage is now set and ready to come alive with the magic of human endeavour."
473,"Great Britain resisted some early brutality from Willie Mason to win an enthralling Test match and open their Tri-Nations account.  Greg Inglis put Australia ahead after a Ben Hornby interception before Paul Wellens made it 6-6 at the break after a superb dummy from Sean Long.  Jamie Peacock then crashed over before Darren Lockyer converted his own try.  But tries from Lee Gilmour and Gareth Raynor, plus a drop-goal from Long, sealed a famous win.  It was a highly physical, tough game of rugby league that GB, pilloried all week in the Australian press, fully deserved to win - in the process inflicting the first defeat for Ricky Stuart as Kangaroos coach.  Great Britain, after their first win in Australia since a a 33-10 victory in Melbourne 14 years ago, now have two points from their first two Tri-Nations games and are in a good position to make the final.  Long, criticised so often in the past for his performances in a Great Britain shirt, was superb, as was skipper Peacock, who led from the front.  The first points of the game were not put on the board until the 29th minute, when Hornby's interception led to winger Inglis racing the length of the field.  Up until that point GB had dominated a brutal opening phase of the match that saw Australian forward Mason floor Stuart Fielden with an early punch.  Mason escaped with a telling-off from referee Ashley Klein and then, with 10 minutes gone, led with the elbow in a very late challenge on Long after the GB half-back had kicked the ball.  Again Mason, who had now been guilty of two incidents of serious foul play, remained on the field.  Yet, as with last week's Test match in New Zealand, GB bossed the early phase of the game in terms of field possession and territory without scoring any points.  At crucial moments an errant pass or an unnecessary offload released the pressure on the Australians.  And they were made to pay when a gamble from Hornby paid off in spectacular style.  He charged from the Kangaroos defensive line and intercepted Long's pass before slipping the ball to Inglis, who crossed under the sticks for a try that Lockyer converted.  But GB were not to be denied and a superb dummy from Long deceived Lockyer and the St Helens half-back broke through the line before passing to Wellens for his club-mate to score.  Long added the extras and GB, who had lost Brian Carney to a hamstring injury, resisted some strong Kangaroos pressure to go in level at the break.  Britain started superbly after the restart, working their way up the field before Peacock bundled his way over from short range despite numerous Australians trying to prevent him from touching down.  The try was awarded on the benefit of the doubt rule and Long added the extras as Aussie Stadium fell silent.  But Australia soon underlined their attacking threat, bursting through the GB line before Lockyer's angled kick went into touch with Jamie Lyon lurking.  And poor positioning by Leon Pryce allowed Inglis to break forward before slipping an inside pass to Lockyer, who raced clear to score before adding the conversion.  A kick through from Lockyer, combined with a slip by Wellens, seemed to set Hornby up for a certain try but he collided with Raynor as he went to touch down and dropped the ball while sustaining a heavy blow that left him dazed and confused.  And having survived that scare, GB won a repeat set and made the most of the opportunity, with Gilmour bursting through a double tackle to score under the posts, again Long adding the extras.  Suddenly it was Australia guilty of handling errors at key times - Mason for example dropping the ball with the line in sight.  Long missed a straightforward penalty and with a drop-goal attempt as he looked to extend GB's lead.  But his misses were not to be punished when GB showed amazing composure after Long broke through and passed the ball to James Roby with four minutes left.  From the next tackle the Lions swept the ball left for Raynor to cross in the corner and although Long's conversion attempt hit the posts, he scored a drop-goal minutes later to seal a famous victory."

German architects GMP's design won the international tender and work will begin at the end of the season.  A new exterior will be built that includes a retractable roof and is due to be completed by 2017.  ""We want to make the Santiago Bernabeu the best stadium in the world,"" said Real Madrid President Florentino Perez.  ""Our commitment is to continue increasing the heritage of our club, thus gain in economic strength, so we can continue to lead in an environment of increasing competition.  ""We believe in a project that will enhance our image, brand and city that we also feel proud of.""  Reports in the Spanish media suggest half the financing for the project would come from selling naming rights and half from a bond issue among Real members.  The Bernabeu currently has a capacity of 85,454 but Real are yet to confirm whether this will change after the refurbishments."

476,"        Magnificent terracotta objects have been found in Nok, in Nigeria, dating back to a period some time between 500 BC and 500 AD. These are the earliest known sculptures on the continent, next to those of Ancient Egypt.       Later around 900 AD, the Igbo-Ukwo was making finely and intricately worked, bronze ceremonial objects. Against this background of creativity and craftsmanship, the Yoruba kingdoms of Benin and Ife sprang up between the 11th and 12th centuries.          In Yoruba mythology, Ife was founded by a senior deity Oduduwa, acting on the order of the supreme deity Olorun (also known as Oludmare). Oduduwa became the first ruler, or Ooni, of Ife.     We know little of how these early Ooni exercised power or how their territory was administered, or precisely when the kingship started. We know that the landscape out of which Ife (and Benin) emerged consisted of a mixture of tropical forests and savannah land, affording very fertile soil and a high rainfall.          One of the keys to understanding the success and wealth of these kingdoms was the ability to provide a significant food surplus. This released labour, which could then be channelled into creating great works of art centred largely on celebrating kingship.      We can still see today an astounding range of objects made of bronze, brass, copper, wood, ceramic and ivory. The superb level of Ife craftsmanship expressed, using the ""lost wax"" method, is comparable with the finest examples of metal-work in Europe from Classical and Renaissance times.       &quotThe art was largely motivated by the culture, the cultural practices of the people. They had to produce certain objects, which they used for certain ritual purposes.&quot   Dr. Ohioma Pogoson, historian and lecturer at University of Ibadan, The African Institute, Nigeria.      Click here to listen to Dr. Pogoson on the political context of art      &quotThe art of Ife and Benin is so important because one gives birth to the other. The Ife art was the most ancient in the forest region of Nigeria, simply because the Ife civilisation goes as far back as 300 - 500 BC. Therefore, it had developed a lot of artefacts, which marks the history of Ife.     Ife later gave birth not only to Benin, but also to the art of Igbo, the Onitsha art, even going as far as to the hinterland of the Igbo, Igbo Ukwu.&quot      Click here to listen to Dr. Eluyemi explaining the relationship between Ife and Benin         Ife was at one time considered the most senior Yuruba state. But by the 17th century it was eclipsed by Oyo. Lying further north, Oyo had the military advantage of a cavalry, and the right agricultural conditions to grow cereal. In the 18th century Oyo reached its peak, largely by profits of the slave trade. With the abolition of slavery its power waned. Today Ife continues to be regarded as the spiritual centre for all Yoruba, and the Ooni of Ife has considerable influence in the country.          The kingship of Benin is closely related to Ife. The first king, or Oba, of Benin is traditionally supposed to be a descendant of Oduduwa, the founder of Ife. The most distinctive examples of Benin craftsmanship are the bronze plaques, which adorned the palace walls. As in the artwork of Ife, the craftsmen of Benin produced bronze and copper heads celebrating the power of the Oba.      The capital of Benin (not to be confused with the modern state of Benin, formerly Dahomey) was south west of Ife. One of the few early written accounts of this centre of power and trade is given by a Portuguese slave trader Joao Afonso Aveiro, who was astounded by what he described as the 'great city of Benin'. Over a hundred years later, a Dutch visitor compared it favourably with Amsterdam. Most of the art was looted by the British in 1897.      &quotA precise model of the object to be made is constructed out of wax. A mould - usually made out of clay - is then formed round the wax model. This is left to harden. The whole thing is then heated. The wax melts away, hence the expression ""lost wax.""      This leaves a hollow space in the shape of the model. Molten metal is then poured into this space, filling it completely. When the metal has cooled down and hardened, the mould is broken, leaving the object in its metal form.&quot       "
477,"The firm said Twiggy was a 'beautiful woman' and did not need retouching A magazine advert featuring Twiggy gave a ""misleading"" impression about an eye cream's effects because her photo had been airbrushed, a watchdog has said. The advert for the Olay Definity eye illuminator carried a testimonial from the model crediting it as her ""secret to brighter-looking eyes"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) made the ruling after more than 700 people complained of airbrushing. Procter and Gamble Ltd, which makes the product, admitted ""minor retouching"". But the company said Twiggy was a ""beautiful woman"" and alterations were ""inconsistent"" with its policies. The image had been voluntarily replaced with one that had no ""post-production"" work in the eye area, it said. Procter and Gamble denied the advert could have negative perceptions on people's body image and rejected claims it was ""socially irresponsible"". It's accepted industry practice in advertising to choose beautiful women such as Twiggy, as models, and to use cosmetics, hair styling and lighting to show them at their best    More than 700 people complained about the ""digitally re-touched"" image in a website campaign set up by Jo Swinson, the Scottish Liberal Democrat MP. In its ruling, the ASA agreed the advert was not socially irresponsible, and said no further action was required because the image had already been withdrawn. It said it acknowledged advertisers were keen to present their products in their most positive light, often using techniques such as post-production enhancement and the re-touching of images. ""However, we considered that the post-production re-touching of this ad, specifically in the eye area, could give consumers a misleading impression of the effect the product could achieve. ""We considered that the combination of references to 'younger looking eyes', including the claim 'reduces the look of wrinkles and dark circles for brighter, younger looking eyes', and post-production re-touching of Twiggy's image around the eye area, was likely to mislead,"" it said. Twiggy became known as the world's first supermodel in the 1960s Ms Swinson said she hoped the ASA's decision would bring airbrushing in advertising ""under control"". ""Experts have already proved that airbrushing contributes to a host of problems in women and young girls such as depression and eating disorders. ""They shouldn't constantly feel the need to measure up to a very narrow range of digitally-manipulated pictures,"" she said. A Procter and Gamble spokesman said: ""It's accepted industry practice in advertising to choose beautiful women such as Twiggy, as models, and to use cosmetics, hair styling and lighting to show them at their best. ""The Definity advertisement was placed only in magazine titles aimed at mature women, to whom Twiggy is relevant.""     "
478,"Anonymity was lifted on seven of the nine gang members A schoolgirl who was raped by a teenage gang believes she may not have been their only victim. The 14-year-old told how some of the nine boys bragged about how they had attacked others girls during her assault in Hackney, east London. All nine have been given detention orders for the rape on 30 April 2007. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme the victim said her life has been destroyed and is ""being punished for something I haven't done"". She said: ""I can't go out, I can't really do anything. ""Everything I used to do, like going shopping and ice skating, I can't do that now because of all the crowds. I've got a fear of crowds and gangs of people."" Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Last week, the nine gang members responsible were jailed for her rape, kidnap and false imprisonment. Judge Wendy Joseph QC lifted an anonymity order and named the seven members of the gang led by O'Neil ""Hitman"" Denton. All were aged between 14 and 17. The girl said during the two-hour attack the boys said it was not the first time they had gang-raped someone. ""They were bragging how they had done it to other girls and how they had got away with it and it is not going to them,"" she said. Talking about the assault, she said: ""They pushed me off into the corner and they were saying again I was to do what they wanted and when I said 'No, I'm not doing it', they were threatening me with the knife and the other boy was kicking me. ""They were saying if you just do what we want, then you can go. ""You think about it - you think, well, they've got a knife, there's four of them, you can't really do nothing and if that's the only way, then you have to do it and so I did what they wanted. Some of the boys denied being involved ""I was begging them and saying 'Please, I'm still a virgin' and they said, 'You ain't going to be one any more, are you?""' She also criticised two passers-by who saw what was happening but did nothing. The assault was eventually ended by an older gang member who then gave evidence for the prosecution at the boys' trial. Her attackers, Denton and Weiled Ibrahim, 17, who admitted rape, kidnap and false imprisonment were given indeterminate detention orders and told they would have to serve a minimum of three years and eight months before becoming eligible for parole. Yusuf Raymond, 16, pleaded guilty to the same charges, and received a nine-year sentence. Jayden Ryan, 16, was given eight years, Alexander Vanderpuije, 15, six years, Jack Bartle, 16, six years, and Cleon Brown, 15, six years. The last two, aged 14 and 16, who still cannot be named, did not physically attack the girl but helped prevent her escaping. They were also given detention orders."
479,"Pop group Simply Red are to reform next year for a 30th anniversary tour, five years on from their last performance.  ""I like an anniversary and this is a big one,"" singer Mick Hucknall said. ""It feels like the right time.""  The chart-topping group, whose hits include Holding Back the Years and Money's Too Tight to Mention, signed off in December 2010 with a ""farewell concert"" at the O2 Arena in London.  The band will play 35 European dates in 2015 starting in Denmark on 20 October.  The Big Love tour will take in 10 cities in Germany and eight other countries before going to the UK and Ireland for 14 dates.  The comeback will come to an end with two dates at London's O2, almost five years to the day from their last appearance there.  The line-up will include the long-time Simply Red members saxophonist Ian Kirkham, guitarist Kenji Suzuki and bass player Steve Lewinson.  In a hand-written note on the band's website, Hucknall said: ""Hello everyone. Am happy to celebrate with you our 30 years in music.  ""We hope you're gonna enjoy the shows as much as we will. See you there!""  Formed in 1985, Simply Red have sold more than 50 million albums. The band's name was inspired by Hucknall's love of Manchester United, his left-leaning political affiliations and the colour of his hair.  Hucknall, now 54, went solo after the split and released a collection of American soul covers in 2012."
480,"The journey Henry Paul has made from Bradford to Gloucester was not an obvious one, but it has proved his fastest route to the top of international rugby union.  That he was going to leave the Bulls at the end of his contract and the Super League season was on the cards for some time.  But his promotion to the England squad after just 80 minutes of Union has come as more of a surprise.  In the summer, he was linked with several rugby league clubs in Australia, and he also considered a move to Super 12 side Waikato Chiefs, allied to the prospect of challenging for selection by the All Blacks.  Paul decided that the England team represented his most likely route to a World Cup Final in the 15-man code - and Clive Woodward has proved him correct so far. Paul qualifies because he never played union in New Zealand, and has an English grandparent. He had spoken to Woodward and his predecessor as England coach, Jack Rowell, about the possibility of representing his adopted country. But Paul, who collected his 23rd New Zealand rugby league cap in July, initially played down his prospects of an international call-up. ""The deal I have signed is with Gloucester and that's where I have got to prove myself first off,"" he said, upon signing for the Cherry and Whites. Born in Tokoroa, New Zealand, on 10 February 1974, Paul arrived in England in 1993, when he captained the Junior Kiwis on their tour of Britain and France. He stayed on to play for Wakefield Trinity, making 19 appearances and scoring 111 points in the process. He then joined Wigan in 1994 and made his international debut for New Zealand at the age of 21 in 1995, the year Wigan won the Challenge Cup, Premiership and Regal Trophy. His career at Central Park lasted for four years and 147 appearances, during which he scored 550 points. In September 1998, at the end of his contract, he moved to Bradford to team up with younger brother Robbie. In April 2000 he became the first player to hold both the Harry Sunderland and Lance Todd Trophies after being named man of the match in the Bulls' first Challenge Cup final triumph for 51 years. Last season he broke the club scoring records with 404 points and 179 goals in a season. While New Zealand lost to Australia in the World Cup Final at Old Trafford last November, Paul had little left to achieve in the 13-man game. Rugby union, however, represents an altogether different proposition. Paul flirted with the code in 1996, playing alongside Jason Robinson in a short-lived experiment with Bath. And Robinson's success since switching codes last autumn can only encourage Paul to believe that he can make a significant impact an international level. ""Jason Robinson is a freak of nature, a special talent,"" Paul said. ""His success was another drawing point and I would like to make the same sort of impact."""

Billboard posters for the Jakarta gig, which takes place on 31 July, featured a logo for the A Mild cigarette brand.  In a statement, Keys said she asked for ""corrective actions"" as soon as she learned of the advertisements.  As a result, she added, the company had withdrawn their sponsorship and all signage had been removed.

482,"The speed with which the Soviet system was transformed and the Soviet state disintegrated took almost everyone by surprise. The system appeared impervious to fundamental change during the years Leonid Brezhnev headed the Politburo (1964-82). And even the most disaffected nationalities in the Soviet Union - a description that fitted the Baltic peoples of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - did not in their wildest dreams believe, when Mikhail Gorbachev succeeded Konstantin Chernenko as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985, that within less than seven years they would be living in independent states. The dramatic events that followed the change of leadership in 1985, culminating in the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of December 1991, had longer-term sources, but these did not determine the form or the timing of the system's transformation. Russia, which occupied three-quarters of the territory of the former Soviet Union, was a different society on the eve of Chernenko's death from what it had been at the time of Joseph Stalin's death just 32 years earlier. In the meanwhile the general level of education had risen, millions more people had entered higher education, and there was greater (though still restricted) knowledge of the outside world. Well-educated professionals had become a significant social group and they were ready to embrace the cultural liberalisation introduced early in the Gorbachev era. Well-educated professionals had become a significant social group and they were ready to embrace the cultural liberalisation introduced early in the Gorbachev era. As well as the pull of social change there was the push of policy failure. The rate of economic growth in the Soviet Union had been in long-term decline from the 1950s to the early 1980s. There was lower life expectancy, especially among adult males (linked by many observers to excessive alcohol consumption), and higher infant mortality rates. Yet such factors do not on their own explain the systemic change of the second half of the 1980s or the collapse of the Soviet state. Many an inefficient state has been able to muddle through or 'muddle down' over decades. Indeed, on these particular socio-economic indicators, post-Soviet Russia has a worse record than the late Soviet period.  The Soviet Union on the eve of Gorbachev's perestroika (reconstruction) had serious political and economic problems. Technologically, it was falling behind not only Western countries but also the newly industrialised countries of Asia. Its foreign policy evinced a declining capacity to win friends and influence people. Yet there was no political instability within the country, no unrest, and no crisis. This was not a case of economic and political crisis producing liberalisation and democratisation. Rather, it was liberalisation and democratisation that brought the regime to crisis point. There were five interconnected transformations in the last years of the Soviet Union which are too often conflated into one 'collapse' or 'implosion'. It is especially important to distinguish between the dismantling of the communist system and the disintegration of the Soviet state, for the former preceded the latter by between two and three years. The five great transformations were as follows. The opening up of the political system Gorbachev began with liberalisation, but by 1988 he was turning to democratisation. He had used the term 'democratisation' even before he became General Secretary, but the decisive turning-point was when he got the 19th Conference of the Communist Party in the summer of 1988 to agree to hold contested elections for a new legislature to be called the Congress of People's Deputies. The elections duly took place the following spring and resulted in defeats for a number of important party officials and victories for some forthright critics of the Communist Party leadership. ...it was liberalisation and democratisation that brought the regime to crisis point. The critics included Boris Yeltsin, who, though still formally a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, had broken with the hierarchy as early as the autumn of 1987 and had become a thorn in their flesh. It was the new institution of competitive elections which, however, enabled him to launch his political comeback. By 1989 the glasnost (openness or transparency) that Gorbachev had proclaimed from the time he became Communist Party and national leader had evolved into freedom of speech and, increasingly, freedom of publication. Long-banned works, such as those of George Orwell and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, were published in huge print-runs while the Soviet Union was still in existence.  The breakdown of the 'command economy' The Soviet economic system had been highly centralised and was based on five-year plans. In practice, the plans could be modified but decisions even on how many tons of nails or pairs of shoes would be produced were taken in ministries in Moscow and co-ordinated by the State Planning Committee (Gosplan) rather than depending on market forces. Gorbachev was in favour of a large measure of marketisation, though he delayed freeing prices. He was aware that this would lead to sharp price rises and it was left to Boris Yeltsin, as president of Russia, to back Yegor Gaidar in taking that step in January 1992. The Soviet economy was in limbo in the last two years of the Soviet Union's existence - no longer a command economy but not yet a market system. Significant reforms, such as permitting individual enterprise (1986), devolving more powers to factories (1987), and legalising co-operatives (1988), which were to become thinly disguised private enterprises, had undermined the old institutional structures and produced unintended consequences, but no viable alternative economic system had been put in their place. Changes in foreign and domestic policy were closely interlinked in the second half of the 1980s. Gorbachev pursued a concessionary foreign policy on the basis of what was called the 'new political thinking'. The ideas were certainly new in the Soviet context and included the belief that the world had become interdependent, that there were universal interests and values that should prevail over class interests and the old East-West divide, and that all countries had the right to decide for themselves the nature of their political and economic systems. The abandonment of communist regimes in Eastern Europe Changes in foreign and domestic policy were closely interlinked in the second half of the 1980s. That last 'right to choose' was taken at face value by the peoples of East-Central Europe in 1989 as one country in the region after another cast aside its communist rulers and moved out of the Soviet camp. While the new governments' rejection of even the reformed Soviet Union was more than Gorbachev had bargained for, he refused to countenance use of force to prevent what critics at home saw as the loss of everything the Soviet Union had gained as a result of the Second World War (in which it lost 27 million of its own citizens). Not a shot was fired by a Soviet soldier as the Central and East Europeans took their countries' destinies into their own hands. In Western capitals it had been an axiom prior to Gorbachev's coming to power that Soviet control over Eastern Europe was non-negotiable and that the most that could be achieved would be an amelioration of oppressive regimes.  The break-up of the Soviet Union When Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and others successfully claimed independent statehood, this had a destabilising effect within the Soviet Union itself. The expectations of, again most notably, Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians were enormously enhanced by what they saw happening in the 'outer empire' and they began to believe that they could remove themselves from the 'inner empire'. In truth, a democratised Soviet Union was incompatible with denial of the Baltic states' independence for, to the extent that those Soviet republics became democratic, their opposition to remaining in a political entity whose centre was Moscow would become increasingly evident. Yet, it was not preordained that the entire Soviet Union would break up. ...it was not preordained that the entire Soviet Union would break up. A major factor in producing its dissolution was Boris Yeltsin's playing of the Russian card against the Union. Since Russia and Russians had long dominated the Soviet state, there was something surprising about a Russian leader (Yeltsin was Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet from 1990 and elected President of Russia in June 1991) demanding Russian 'sovereignty' from the Union in 1990 and full 'independence' in 1991. Gorbachev and his remaining supporters in the leadership of the federal government had negotiated a new Union Treaty between the spring and summer of 1991, designed to keep a majority of republics, including Russia, within a much looser federation in which far greater powers than hitherto were to be devolved from the centre to the republics. For conservative communists in the party apparatus, the military and the KGB, this was the last straw and they mounted a coup in August 1991 which began on the 18th with their putting Gorbachev under house arrest in his holiday home on the Crimean coast, and ended on the 22nd. The putschists themselves had been affected by the changes of the preceding years and they showed lack of resolution when faced by defiance from Yeltsin and thousands of Russian citizens who surrounded the parliament building from which Yeltsin was still able to communicate with the outside world. Moreover, by taking action just two months after Yeltsin had been popularly elected, their claims to be speaking on behalf of the people as a whole rang hollow.  The coup failed for many reasons, among them divisions within the military and the KGB. Within a few days the principal putschists were under arrest. Gorbachev, who had been elected President of the Soviet Union in March 1990, not by the citizenry as a whole but indirectly by the Congress of People's Deputies, was enormously weakened by the revolt against him by people he had appointed to high office. Yeltsin wasted no time in taking advantage of his new position of strength. Conscious of the fact that with no Union there would be no Gorbachev in the Kremlin, he proceeded to wind up the USSR in conjunction with the leaders of the two other Slavic republics of Belarus and Ukraine. On 25 December 1991 the red flag was lowered from the Kremlin and by the end of the month the Soviet Union had passed into history. Fifteen new states stood where one mighty superpower had recently held sway. Neither the system nor the Union had to disappear in this particular way. Before liberalisation and democratisation from above, only a handful of dissidents dared voice their grievances and demands in public. A different leader from Gorbachev might have resorted to old-style coercion the moment he saw that reform was leading to loss of control. A different leader from Yeltsin might have strived to preserve the boundaries of a 'greater Russia' rather than accept borders that had never, historically, been those of his country and which, moreover, meant that 25 million Russians found themselves all of a sudden living 'abroad'. Each of the five great transformations interacted with and influenced the others. Fifteen new states stood where one mighty superpower had recently held sway. But the sequence was that the Soviet Union was first reformed, then transformed, and then disintegrated all within the space of six-and-a-half years. It had ceased to be a communist system in any meaningful sense from the time of the state-wide contested elections of the spring of 1989. Inside the Communist Party, vigorous public debate had replaced 'democratic centralism'. Moreover, the basic principle of the party's 'leading role' within the political system and society was being challenged from all sides as new political organisations sprang up. In March 1990 the Communist Party's monopoly of power was removed from the Soviet Constitution, formal recognition of what had been the reality on the ground for the past year. Seldom, if ever, has a highly authoritarian political system, deploying military means sufficient to destroy life on earth, been dismantled so peacefully. Never has an empire disintegrated with so little bloodshed. Although huge difficulties remained for the successor states, the way Soviet communism came to an end was one of the great success stories of 20th century politics."
483,"The MEP had quit the UK Independence Party after failing to become leader.  Now Veritas member Ken Wharton wants to run against the ex-chatshow host saying the party is being mismanaged. He wants to run as soon as a contest is allowed.  A party spokesman said it would allow a challenge if the party members wished. But he said Mr Kilroy-Silk was more concerned with the Cheadle by-election.  The spokesman added: ""As a truly democratic party, Veritas will allow a leadership contest every year if the party members wish.""  Discontented members have set up the Veritas Members' Association pledging to ""put the truth back into Veritas"".  They want to change the way the party is run, and make it more accountable to the membership.  They claim 10 of Veritas' general election candidates have already tendered their resignations from the party.  Mr Wharton argues that Veritas members are ""not being looked after"".  The 47-year-old, who served in the Navy and is now unemployed, said he planned to run as soon as possible.  At the general election Mr Kilroy-Silk failed in his bid to win the Erewash seat, slipping to fourth place behind the three major parties.  Mr Kilroy-Silk lost to incumbent Labour MP Elizabeth Blackman, who won re-election with a decreased majority.  In the Cheadle by-election, Stockport Borough Council leader Mark Hunter will run on 14 July for the Lib Dems against Tory Stephen Day and Labour's Mark Miller.  Veritas' candidate is Leslie Leggett, and John Allman of Alliance for Change - Suffering Little Children is running."
484,"The 25-year-old suffered a fractured left fibula and an open dislocation of his left ankle after a tackle by Birmingham's Martin Taylor.  Eduardo will have his leg in plaster for the next six to eight weeks before beginning a rehabilitation programme.  Arsenal say the Croatia international should be running again in six months.  Eduardo is expected to be out of the game for nine months but, in a statement, Arsenal said: ""Eduardo would like to once again thank everyone for the overwhelming messages of support he has received.""  After sustaining the injury, Eduardo was taken to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham and underwent surgery on Saturday before being transferred to a London-based hospital on Sunday.  Taylor has been targeted by some angry fans - including a number from Croatia - who have posted threatening messages on various internet sites.  And security personnel had to restrain Croatian journalists, who ran on to the road and tried to get into Taylor's car as he left the club's Wast Hills training complex on Monday.  But Croatia manager Slaven Bilic, who will now be without his prolific striker for the European Championship finals this summer, has been quick to defend the 28-year-old centre-half.  ""The injury made the tackle look bad,"" Bilic told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""You see many tackles like that, almost every week.""  ""That's perhaps wrong for football but I'm sure Martin Taylor is a sportsman and he wanted to play the ball.  ""On another occasion Eduardo could have received a worse tackle and got away without injury - everything went wrong but Eduardo knows Taylor didn't do it deliberately.""  The incident occurred early on in Arsenal's 2-2 draw at St Andrew's and Birmingham manager Alex McLeish conceded the experience has been difficult for Taylor psychologically.  But McLeish does not believe Taylor's straight red card was warranted.  ""The fact that (some commentators were surprised at the red card) tells the story itself - it was seen as just another normal tackle in a game of football where there is contact,"" he stated.  ""Martin was horrified. There certainly wasn't a big protest over the red card from him but he has seen the damage that was done to Eduardo and I could see it in his face.  ""Even if the referee had given him a yellow card I don't know if he could have played on any way.""  ""We've had to rally round Martin Taylor because he is mentally shattered by the whole experience.""  Former Rangers and Scotland boss McLeish recalled the way ex-Celtic striker Henrik Larsson came back from a horrific leg break in 1999 and is hopeful for Eduardo.  ""Henrik Larsson received a bad one a few years ago in Lyon, while playing for Celtic and when I saw Eduardo I could think it was something similar,"" added McLeish.  ""The technology and medical treatments nowadays meant Henrik Larsson came back to show he was a world-class player.  ""Eduardo's a world-class player and he's definitely in the right hands and I'm sure he will come back.""  Meanwhile, former Coventry defender David Busst is confident Eduardo, who has scored 12 goals in his debut season for Arsenal, will play again if there are no complications in his recovery.  Busst's career was ended by a similar injury to Eduardo's and was suffered against Manchester United in 1996.  ""If there's no complications, I'm sure he will be back playing again,"" Busst told BBC Radio 5 Live.  ""It wasn't the break that stopped me playing again but the infections I caught after that.  ""I suffered a double compound fracture of the tibia and fibula and had 20 operations on my right leg, with 10 operations in the first 12 days.  ""I'd like to reassure Eduardo and tell him not to let people compare his injury to mine because I did have to give up.  ""It was the infection, muscle and tissue damage that stopped me from playing again.  ""They will have closed up where the bone had come out from the skin and pinned the bones.  ""If they have done all that without any infection then he will be back playing when the bone has healed in about 12 months."""
485,"A cache of 500 original Beatles tapes stolen in the 1970s and containing tracks which have never before been released, has been recovered.  Police said the tapes were ""priceless"" and the only recordings from them which had ever been heard before were on bootlegs.  They were discovered in Holland when police cracked a piracy racket, arresting five people in raids in west London and the Netherlands.  The tapes are the only original recordings made and are thought likely to include material which has never been previously released.  They contain what is knows as the Get Back sessions.  An album of the same name was due to be released in 1969, but the project was abandoned and they became part of the Let It Be album instead.  The tapes disappeared shortly after the 1969 Get Back sessions, which saw the band returning to a back to basics approach to recording after the tensions of the 1968 ""White Album"".  The reels contain dozens of entire songs, as well as snippets of tracks which they attempted and then abandoned during the rehearsals.  A number of pirated versions of the tapes have been recovered in the UK, Mainland Europe and the USA, since they went missing more than 30 years ago.  Detective Inspector Paul Johnston of the City of London Police said: ""This is a good example of how an international multi-agency approach by both the private sector and police agencies can combat offences of this nature.""  Investigations were conducted by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which consulted the City of London Police, who identified a number of suspects.  A joint covert operation was mounted between the City of London Police's central detective unit and Dutch police.  On 10 January, City of London Police officers arrested two people in west London and another three were arrested in a town west of Amsterdam.  Prosecutor spokesman in Amsterdam, Robert Meulenbroek said: ""We're currently investigating whether they really are the originals, but it appears to be so.  ""There are about 500 tapes, so there's quite a bit to research.""  Speaking on News 24, City of London Police's director of intelligence Kieron Sharp said: ""The operation was conducted partly over in Holland and partly in this country.  ""But the tapes were stored over there and that's where they were recovered.""  The police investigation has taken a year to complete.  David Munns, vice chairman of EMI who sits on the IFPI board, said: ""Music piracy is a serious crime.  ""EMI will support all efforts to defend the intellectual property of our artists and of producers.""  IFPI chairman Jay Berman said: ""We applaud this exemplary police operation, which reflects the extraordinary level of international co-ordination that is needed to tackle the sophisticated cross-border strategies of today's organised music pirates.""  The tapes have been recovered along with other items believed to have been stolen from the recording company.  A number of search warrants have also been executed in the London area."
486,"Mr Hinkes, 50, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, secured his place in the record books when he successfully climbed Kangchenjunga in Nepal in June.  On Friday, he will be made an honorary citizen of his home town at a ceremony in recognition of his achievement.  ""He's put Northallerton on the map,"" a spokeswoman for the town council said.  ""We felt we should do something because he's done very well. He's incredible.""  Mr Hinkes, a former geography teacher, was born in Northallerton in 1954 and educated at the town's grammar school.  He started his quest to conquer all mountains over a height of 8,000m in 1987.  At 8,586m (28,169ft), Kangchenjunga is the world's third highest mountain and was the final hurdle in Mr Hinkes' challenge.  Only 12 other people have reached the summit of all the mountains over 8,000m."
487,"Power disruption has affected one of HBOS' computer centres Halifax customers have been hit by a power failure affecting all branches, cash machines and online banking. The bank said an external power disruption at an IT centre in Yorkshire caused problems to a range of Halifax and Bank of Scotland (HBOS) services. Power has now been restored, and the company says systems, including cash machines, are now running. Internet banking has also been restored, having been affected by the earlier problems. An HBOS spokeswoman said: ""We apologise to customers for the disruption and inconvenience this is causing."" Branches were open this morning, but it was only possible to withdraw money at the counter service, where staff were writing transaction details down on paper. HBOS cash machines were out of service, and customers had also been having their cards rejected at the cash machines of other banks, and in some shops. A spokesperson said cash machines started working again at 1430 GMT and bank cards are again being accepted at shops and at other banks' ATMs, as usual. At one branch of Halifax in London, this morning, customers were greeted at the door by a manager telling them that ""all banking services are down"". Appointments were being cancelled, because staff computer systems were not working, and customers were only allowed to withdraw a maximum of £200 because the bank could not check their account balance. An HBOS spokesperson said: ""Power was restored to the centre via our back up generators in the late morning and all systems, including cash machines, are running normally as of 1430.""     "
488,"It has taken a year to make XP compatible with the XO Microsoft has joined forces with the developers of the ""$100 laptop"" to make Windows available on the machines. The move was prompted by countries which demanded the operating system before placing an order. Trials of laptops loaded with Windows will begin in ""four to five"" countries from June, the organisations said. The founder of One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), which developed the machines, denied the move was a ""desperate new measure"" to secure more orders. Who wants to bet that government education departments, already far more familiar with Microsoft's operating system, will now opt for the Linux alternative?    ""While it is certainly true that it has not taken off as fast as I would have hoped and publicly stated, certain countries around the world... have always been very, very insistent that they want Windows as an option,"" Nicholas Negroponte told BBC News. Until now, the XO machines, as they are known, have only been offered with an open-source Linux operating system. OLPC originally aimed to sell the low-cost laptops in lots of one million to governments in developing countries for $100 each. The innovative machines, which have been designed for use in remote and harsh environments, were to be distributed to school children. Trials of the laptop have been running in Nigeria Over time, however, the project was forced to drop the minimum number of machines that could be ordered. Each machine currently costs $188 ($198 with Windows XP). So far, it has sold just 600,000, according to Professor Negroponte, although he said it expected a further 400,000 orders in the next ""60 to 90 days"". ""There is no question that demand goes up when you offer dual boot,"" said Professor Negroponte. Machines will eventually be offered with the ability to run either Windows XP or Linux, although he admitted there were still some technical issues to overcome to achieve this. ""I liken running Windows in dual boot on the laptop as exactly what Apple did on their machines,"" said Professor Negroponte. ""A lot of people moved to the Apple laptop once it had that dual boot."" It has taken Microsoft nearly one year to make its software compatible with the XO machine. It will cost an additional $3, plus $7 for hardware, and will be offered on a 2GB memory card that can be plugged into the machine. According to Microsoft, it supports many of the XO's unique features including its custom keys, writing pad and power-saving mode. Crucially, however, it does not currently support the mesh networking that allows the computers to talk to one another and share data. In addition, the user interface designed for the XO - called Sugar - does not yet run on XP, although Professor Negroponte said that OLPC would work with ""third parties"" to find a solution to this. The options afforded by Windows will be welcomed by the governments of countries, such as Egypt, which has insisted on being offered the operating system before signing up to the scheme. Other customers and partners have already applauded the shift. ""Windows support on the XO device means that our students and educators will now have access to more than computer-assisted learning experiences,"" said Andres Gonzalez Diaz, governor of Cundinamarca, Colombia. ""They will also develop marketable technology skills, which can lead to jobs and opportunities for our youth of today and the work force of tomorrow."" However, others have been less forthcoming with praise about the opportunities Windows affords. ""[OLPC] should not believe the nonsense about Windows being a requirement for business after the children grow up,"" wrote Ivan Krstic, who recently resigned as the organisation's top security architect, on his blog. ""Windows is a requirement because enough people grew up with it, not the other way around. If OLPC made a billion people grow up with Linux, Linux would be just dandy for business."" Mr Krstic said that he was enthusiastic about Sugar being made available on the ""most widely used operating system in existence"" but was opposed to Windows becoming ""the single OS that OLPC offers for the XO"". ""[OLPC] should not become a vehicle for creating economic incentives for a particular vendor,"" he wrote. Whilst Professor Negroponte said this was not the intention, he could not rule out the possibility of XP becoming the sole offering in the future. ""If that's the way it unfolds, that's the way it unfolds. We are in the learning business and what the operating system is underneath is less germane,"" he told BBC News. ""A lot of it will end up as what governments and educational institutions choose to use,"" added James Utzchneider of Microsoft.     "
489,"The Congolese government accused Karel de Gucht of acting like Tintin - a colonial-era Belgian cartoon character.  ""Belgium needs a minister of foreign affairs who is a diplomat,"" the Congolese information minister said.  While visiting Africa, Mr de Gucht said Congolese politicians were unable to introduce democracy or end corruption.  He later told Belgian MPs that ministers in the DR Congo's transitional government spent most of their time fighting each other.  Elections are due to be held next year - the first since the end of a five-year war during which 3.3 million died.  Henri Mova Sakanyi said in a statement that the minister was treating Belgium's former colonies like children and was ""completely ignorant of the basic rules of diplomacy"".  The comments border on ""racism and nostalgia for colonialism"", the minister said.  Tintin, first printed in 1929, has been criticised for using racist stereotypes of non-Europeans.  But when asked by Belgian radio about the recall on Friday, Mr de Gucht, a Flemish-speaking right-winger who was appointed in July, appeared unrepentant about his blunt speaking.  ""To me, it seems that the Congolese politicians in one way or another have to be aware of the fact that there are serious problems,"" he said.  DR Congo currently has a transitional government, led by President Joseph Kabila, and with former rebel leaders in senior positions.  ""There is a problem with the political class in Congo and Kinshasa, and apparently there are few people who are aware of the historic task and the challenges they are facing,"" Mr de Gucht told Belgian radio from South Africa.  ""I have met a lot of people and I wonder if they are the people to transform this country into a democracy and seriously manage it... There needs to be an end to corruption,"" he added.  The BBC's Rob Walker says that behind this war of words, there are real concerns within the international community about the pace of DR Congo's transition.  Although former rebels have joined the government, most are not yet integrated into the national army, he says.  There has also been little progress in tackling corruption and preparations for next year's elections are proceeding slowly."
490,"Security services detained Nourredine Boudiafi, head of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), in the eastern Algiers suburb of Bab Ezzouar in November.  His deputy, Chaabane Younes, was killed in Chlef, 210km (160 miles) west of Algiers, the ministry added.  The GIA has already been weakened by internal rivalries, the statement said.  The ministry statement did not give precise details of Mr Boudiafi's arrest or of the killing of Mr Younes.  But it said his arrest followed the killing of Mr Boudiafi's predecessor, Rachid Ouakali, alias Abu Tourab, in July by his own men so that Mr Boudiafi could take over.  The GIA was the most radical of Algeria's armed Islamic movements, says the BBC's Mohamed Arezki Himeur in Algiers.  It has been behind the majority of attacks and assassinations targeting intellectuals, journalists and foreigners.  The group was also responsible for the bloody hijacking of an Air France airbus in December 1994 at Algiers airport, and a series of civilian massacres in several parts of the country during the 1990s.  But its power started to wane at the end of the 1990s following the death of leader Djamel Zitouni by Islamic rivals in an ambush, says our correspondent.  The battle for the leadership led to internal divisions and rivalries that sparked the establishment of other armed groups.  The Salafist group, GSPC - considered today to be the most important armed Islamic movement - was born in 1998 out of the wrangling of the GIA."
491,"Original advice suggested that foods such as butter, meat, cheese and eggs could be eaten ""liberally"".  Now, however, Atkins Nutritionals suggests that intake of saturated fats should be limited to 20% of total calories.  The change of tack will come as a relief to nutrition experts who say that a high-fat diet poses a health risk to some.  In the UK, the website of the Food Standards Agency expressed concern about the makeup of the diet, which heavily restricts certain food groups such as carbohydrates - for example bread and pasta.  High levels of protein intake might also pose a threat to patients with certain medical conditions, it is claimed.  However, millions in the UK have tried the diet, and many say it has helped them lose weight with minimal or no unpleasant side-effects.  They say that the emphasis on fresh food - and bans on high-sugar processed food - has in itself led to healthier eating.  She said: ""The media and opponents of Atkins often sensationalise and simplify the diet as the all-the-steak-you-can-eat diet. This has never been true.""  A spokesman for the UK arm of the company said: ""The whole idea is to reduce your carbohydrate, but it is not all about red meat.  ""Not all fats are bad for you, but like anything, they should be taken in moderation.""  However, a spokesman for the US arm of the company said that the advice did not represent a change of tack.  She said: ""Saturated fat remains a valuable part of the Atkins nutritional approach.  ""And there is absolutely no science to support any claims that eating red meat and saturated fat as part of your Atkins programme is anything other then beneficial.""  ""That means fruit and veg and bread and cereals, and less fats, salt and sugar.""  The agency recommends that 11% of calorie intake should come from fats."
492,"by BBC News Online's Chris Summers An MP, Piara Khabra, has urged the police to redouble their efforts to find the killer of a Sikh newspaper editor assassinated in London five years ago, a crime which could be linked to the Air India bombing in 1985. The murder of Tarsem Singh Purewal, editor of Britain's biggest-selling Punjabi weekly Des Pardes, in Southall, west London may also be linked to the assassination of another Punjabi-language newspaper in Canada in 1998. Tara Singh Hayer, editor of the Indo-Canadian Times, was gunned down at his home in Surrey, British Columbia 10 years after being paralysed by another gunman.       Mr Hayer's son, Dave, told BBC News Online: ""I'm sure the same organisation was behind both deaths, if not the same individual. ""My father and Mr Purewal were good friends and both were investigating the same elements in the Sikh community. He said: ""They are small in number but they are involved in criminal activities, terrorism. They were trying to expose them."" Mr Hayer, whose father was installed in the Canadian Press Hall of Fame last month, said: ""Despite being shot in 1988, he decided to stand up for his community and said 'If they are going to kill me, so be it'."" He said he believed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) might be close to cracking the case and said: ""Hopefully when it is solved, the Purewal case will be looked at again. ""There are so many good, honest British Sikhs who will bring this information to the police. They will be helping the Sikh cause, as well as bringing the criminals to justice.""       Gurbux Singh Virk, editor of Des Pardes, told BBC News Online it appeared the police had closed the file on his predecessor's murder and he said he was ""disappointed"" with their attitude. The roots to both killings seem to lie in Punjabi politics. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent the army in to crush pro-independence Sikhs in the Punjab. But she signed her own death warrant by ordering troops to flush militants out of the sacred Golden Temple in Amritsar. Her assassination, by her Sikh bodyguards, sparked a wave of attacks on Sikhs all over India. In the Punjab supporters of an independent Sikh state - known as Khalistan - massacred many political opponents and non-Sikhs.      The Sikh religion was founded by a Hindu, Guru Nanak, in the 16th century but retains close cultural links with Hinduism. There are 20 million Sikhs worldwide, of whom 9.5 million live in the Punjab, a fertile area of northern India which provides 60% of India's grain. Orthodox adherents are distinguished by long, flowing hair known as kesh - worn in a turban by men; a metal bangle or kkara which they wear; a ceremonial dagger or kirpan carried on the waist; a kangha or comb which they also use; and an under-garment called a kaccha. When Britain quit the sub-continent in 1947 the Punjab was split in half and most Sikhs fled Pakistan to live on the Indian side of the border. But by 1990 India had regained the upper hand in the Punjab and violence fell markedly. Stability was achieved at a price - there were accusations of widespread police brutality and many supporters of Khalistan have only recently been released from detention. Sikhs all over the world have been affected by the trouble back home. There are pro- and anti-Khalistan cliques wherever the Sikh diaspora has taken roots. Britain's most sizeable Sikh community is in the west London suburb of Southall. There are also significant Sikh communities in the United States, South Africa, Malaysia and Canada - 250,000 Sikhs live in British Columbia alone. Mr Purewal, 60, founded Des Pardes (Home and Abroad) in 1965 and the paper tended to take a pro-Khalistan viewpoint during the 1980s and early 1990s but shortly before his death he appeared to have fallen out with certain radical Sikh groups. Kim Bolan, a reporter on the Vancouver Sun newspaper who has covered Sikh politics since 1984, told BBC News Online Mr Purewal had been preparing a series of articles uncovering fraud and other shady practices within the separatist movement. She said Mr Purewal, who had been to several Sikh terror training camps in Pakistan, also knew details of the Air India bombing in 1985, which killed 329 people. Around 8.15pm on Tuesday, 24 January 1995, Mr Purewal was pulling down the shutters outside his office in Southall.       A gunman appeared from nowhere and killed him with a single shot through the chest. Although it took place in a busy street in the middle of the evening, no witnesses came forward and the killer left few clues. Police arrested several people in Birmingham, including Ragbir Singh, editor of another Sikh newspaper, Awaze Quam. He was eliminated from their inquiries, as were the other suspects. The incident room closed down and the killing appeared forgotten. Piara Khabra, Labour MP for Ealing Southall and himself a Sikh, told BBC News Online: ""The police have not been able to get any new information or any evidence whatsoever."" He said he intended to write to the Metropolitan Police to discover the reasons for the failure.       Mr Khabra said: ""I read about cases from 40 years ago being detected, and yet this case seems to be beyond them. I sometimes feel that not much attention is given to these cases if they are members of the ethnic minority community, certainly not as much as for white murders."" Mr Khabra said: ""It does not matter what the motive is, the police should be investigating properly and should find the murderer. ""With Mr Purewal's case, I don't know whether they have given up. There should be no reason to give up."" Jump forward to Wednesday 18 November 1998. Mr Hayer was manouvering himself from his car into his wheelchair when the killer struck. No-one saw the gunman, who chose to strike in the garage, knowing he would be shielded from the close circuit television cameras which police had installed around the house after the 1988 shooting. Corporal Dan Russell, of the RCMP, told BBC News Online: ""It is still an active investigation. We have not charged anybody but we still have leads to follow."" He said Mr Hayer had received several death threats, some of which emanated from political opponents, shortly before his death but it was not clear if they were from his eventual killers. Fingers have been pointed in the direction of two radical Sikh groups. Ms Bolan, who has received death threats herself and had to move out of her Vancouver home after shots were fired at it, said pro-Khalistan groups had been on the retreat on both sides of the Atlantic since the early 1990s. She said Mr Hayer had agreed to be a witness against suspects in the Air India case and much of his evidence was based on information he had received from Mr Purewal. Ms Bolan said: ""Mr Purewal was on the verge of doing a series of articles which were going to embarrass the ISYF and Babbar Khalsa.""       A few days after Mr Purewal was killed a caller claiming to represent a group implicated in the assassination of Mrs Gandhi claimed responsibility for the killing. But there was no way to corroborate the claim. After all, Mr Purewal's death could have had a more banal explanation. Detectives investigating his death unearthed evidence he had been routinely breaking UK law by publishing the name of rape victims in court reports. Court officials were unaware, because they could not read Punjabi. But one theory circulating in Southall was that Mr Purewal was murdered by a hitman hired by a family whose name had been disgraced by the naming of their daughter as a rape victim. Mr Khabra said: ""I'm not concerned about what was the motive, murder is murder and it's the police's duty to find the culprit and the police have to explain why they appear to have given up."" A Scotland Yadrd spokeswoman said: ""The case was reviewed last year as a result of new information. ""All lines of inquiry were pursued and exhausted. However if any new information comes to light this will be fully and thoroughly investigated."" Anyone with information about the murder of Mr Purewal should contact the incident room on 020 8733 4734 or ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111. Anyone with information on the Hayer case can contact Cpl Russell on (001) 604 599 7641."
493,"The leader of Serbia's largest party is now better known for sparring with prosecutors in The Hague than for practising politics in Belgrade. Vojislav Seselj has spent the last four years in the dock on war crimes charges while the party he leads has become Serbia's most influential opposition group. His image is still used on party propaganda - but his influence is said to have weakened, with delays to his trial keeping him out of the public eye for long periods. Mr Seselj's supporters will hope the resumption of proceedings against him in The Hague revives his fortunes and gives him a chance to defend his reputation. He has used past televised court appearances as a platform for his wit and views, ridiculing the court's formality and accusing it of bias against the Serbs. A hardline nationalist, Mr Seselj is one of the last surviving leaders from the political class that propelled the Serb-dominated Yugoslav state through the Balkan wars of the 1990s. He is accused of plotting to murder, torture and illegally imprison non-Serbs during the conflict. He turned himself in to The Hague in 2003, but has remained the figurehead of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS). Vojislav Seselj was a brilliant student, becoming the youngest PhD holder in Yugoslavia, and going on to teach first at Michigan and then at Sarajevo universities. He got into trouble early in his career for writing an unpublished article calling for Yugoslavia to be replaced with a Serb-dominated entity and was jailed for two years. After his release, he moved to Belgrade where he fell out of favour with the academic community because of his provocative outbursts, but became a rising figure on the political scene. He grasped the moment in 1990 when, as the Yugoslav Federation began to crumble, he established the SRS. He presented himself as the successor to the nationalist Chetnik fighters of World War II. A string of paramilitary groups - including the Chetniks, the White Eagles and the Seseljovci - were set up among his supporters. In the early years of the war his public statements included the threat to blow up the nuclear power station at Krsko in Slovenia and the warning to Nato that air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs would be avenged with missile attacks on targets in Italy, Austria and Croatia. The groups fought in the Bosnian and Croatian wars with the backing of former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and are accused of committing a string of atrocities. As long ago as the end of 1992, Mr Seselj was among seven prominent individuals who then-US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger suggested should be investigated for war crimes. He denies the charges. As the battle for Bosnia unfolded, Mr Seselj was becoming a crucial ally of Mr Milosevic in parliament. He indoctrinated [paramilitary units] with his extreme ethnic rhetoric so that they engaged in the forcible removal of the non-Serb population... with particular violence and brutality    But Mr Seselj broke with his protector in 1993, when Mr Milosevic appeared to endorse a peace plan and withdraw support from the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Milosevic was forced to dissolve parliament and rounded on Mr Seselj, calling him ""the personification of violence and primitivism"". In the slanging match which followed, Mr Seselj implicated Mr Milosevic, his police and high-ranking members of his government in alleged atrocities. But it was Kosovo which brought the two rivals together again, uniting them in a new wave of nationalist fervour. Mr Seselj was uncompromising in his views, reportedly saying of the Kosovo Albanians: ""Their country is Albania and they should live there. The only Albanians who should live here are the ones who think of Serbia as their fatherland."" From his prison cell at the Hague, Mr Milosevic urged his supporters to back Mr Seselj in the 2002 Serbian presidential elections, winning him 23% and third place in the first round of voting. Slobodan Milosevic was both an ally and a rival to Mr Seselj Facing incumbent president Vojislav Kostunica in the second round, he pushed for a boycott - thereby helping to invalidate the whole process by dropping turn-out below the necessary 50%. In the re-run of the election he came second, but the turnout was still too low. However, the populism that appealed to voters in the presidential poll also saw Mr Seselj through parliamentary polls in 2003 and has kept his party relevant even after the death of his old ally while in custody at The Hague. His SRS is thought to have struck a chord most with those who suffered from the economic disasters that beset post-Milosevic Serbia. As his party continues to harry the reform-oriented government in Serbia, Mr Seselj is expected to follow in the footsteps of his one-time political protector, Mr Milosevic, and use his war crimes trial to air some of the uncompromising views he has become famous for."

495,"Arran Frood investigates what could have been the very first batteries and how these important archaeological and technological artefacts are now at risk from the impending war in Iraq. I don't think anyone can say for sure what they were used for, but they may have been batteries because they do work    War can destroy more than a people, an army or a leader. Culture, tradition and history also lie in the firing line. Iraq has a rich national heritage. The Garden of Eden and the Tower of Babel are said to have been sited in this ancient land. In any war, there is a chance that priceless treasures will be lost forever, articles such as the ""ancient battery"" that resides defenceless in the museum of Baghdad. For this object suggests that the region, whose civilizations gave us writing and the wheel, may also have invented electric cells - two thousand years before such devices were well known. It was in 1938, while working in Khujut Rabu, just outside Baghdad in modern day Iraq, that German archaeologist Wilhelm Konig unearthed a five-inch-long (13 cm) clay jar containing a copper cylinder that encased an iron rod. Could have been used in gilding Click here for more on what the batteries might have been used for The vessel showed signs of corrosion, and early tests revealed that an acidic agent, such as vinegar or wine had been present. In the early 1900s, many European archaeologists were excavating ancient Mesopotamian sites, looking for evidence of Biblical tales like the Tree of Knowledge and Noah's flood. Konig did not waste his time finding alternative explanations for his discovery. To him, it had to have been a battery. Though this was hard to explain, and did not sit comfortably with the religious ideology of the time, he published his conclusions. But soon the world was at war, and his discovery was forgotten. More than 60 years after their discovery, the batteries of Baghdad - as there are perhaps a dozen of them - are shrouded in myth. ""The batteries have always attracted interest as curios,"" says Dr Paul Craddock, a metallurgy expert of the ancient Near East from the British Museum. ""They are a one-off. As far as we know, nobody else has found anything like these. They are odd things; they are one of life's enigmas."" No two accounts of them are the same. Some say the batteries were excavated, others that Konig found them in the basement of the Baghdad Museum when he took over as director. There is no definite figure on how many have been found, and their age is disputed. Most sources date the batteries to around 200 BC - in the Parthian era, circa 250 BC to AD 225. Skilled warriors, the Parthians were not noted for their scientific achievements. ""Although this collection of objects is usually dated as Parthian, the grounds for this are unclear,"" says Dr St John Simpson, also from the department of the ancient Near East at the British Museum. ""The pot itself is Sassanian. This discrepancy presumably lies either in a misidentification of the age of the ceramic vessel, or the site at which they were found."" In the history of the Middle East, the Sassanian period (circa AD 225 - 640) marks the end of the ancient and the beginning of the more scientific medieval era. Though most archaeologists agree the devices were batteries, there is much conjecture as to how they could have been discovered, and what they were used for. How could ancient Persian science have grasped the principles of electricity and arrived at this knowledge? Perhaps they did not. Many inventions are conceived before the underlying principles are properly understood. The Chinese invented gunpowder long before the principles of combustion were deduced, and the rediscovery of old herbal medicines is now a common occurrence. You do not always have to understand why something works - just that it does. It is certain the Baghdad batteries could conduct an electric current because many replicas have been made, including by students of ancient history under the direction of Dr Marjorie Senechal, professor of the history of science and technology, Smith College, US. ""I don't think anyone can say for sure what they were used for, but they may have been batteries because they do work,"" she says. Replicas can produce voltages from 0.8 to nearly two volts. Could the batteries have been placed inside idols?  (Image by Stephanie Yong) Making an electric current requires two metals with different electro potentials and an ion carrying solution, known as an electrolyte, to ferry the electrons between them. Connected in series, a set of batteries could theoretically produce a much higher voltage, though no wires have ever been found that would prove this had been the case. ""It's a pity we have not found any wires,"" says Dr Craddock. ""It means our interpretation of them could be completely wrong."" But he is sure the objects are batteries and that there could be more of them to discover. ""Other examples may exist that lie in museums elsewhere unrecognised"". He says this is especially possible if any items are missing, as the objects only look like batteries when all the pieces are in place. Some have suggested the batteries may have been used medicinally. The ancient Greeks wrote of the pain killing effect of electric fish when applied to the soles of the feet. The Chinese had developed acupuncture by this time, and still use acupuncture combined with an electric current. This may explain the presence of needle-like objects found with some of the batteries. But this tiny voltage would surely have been ineffective against real pain, considering the well-recorded use of other painkillers in the ancient world like cannabis, opium and wine. Other scientists believe the batteries were used for electroplating - transferring a thin layer of metal on to another metal surface - a technique still used today and a common classroom experiment. This idea is appealing because at its core lies the mother of many inventions: money. In the making of jewellery, for example, a layer of gold or silver is often applied to enhance its beauty in a process called gilding. Two main techniques of gilding were used at the time and are still in use today: hammering the precious metal into thin strips using brute force, or mixing it with a mercury base which is then pasted over the article. These techniques are effective, but wasteful compared with the addition of a small but consistent layer of metal by electro-deposition. The ability to mysteriously electroplate gold or silver on to such objects would not only save precious resources and money, but could also win you important friends at court. Let's hope the world manages to resolve its present problems so people can go and see them    A palace, kingdom, or even the sultan's daughter may have been the reward for such knowledge - and motivation to keep it secret. Testing this idea in the late seventies, Dr Arne Eggebrecht, then director of Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Hildesheim, connected many replica Baghdad batteries together using grape juice as an electrolyte, and claimed to have deposited a thin layer of silver on to another surface, just one ten thousandth of a millimetre thick. Other researchers though, have disputed these results and have been unable to replicate them. ""There does not exist any written documentation of the experiments which took place here in 1978,"" says Dr Bettina Schmitz, currently a researcher based at the same Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum. ""The experiments weren't even documented by photos, which really is a pity,"" she says. ""I have searched through the archives of this museum and I talked to everyone involved in 1978 with no results."" Although a larger voltage can be obtained by connecting more than one battery together, it is the ampage which is the real limiting factor, and many doubt whether a high enough power could ever have been obtained, even from tens of Baghdad batteries. One serious flaw with the electroplating hypothesis is the lack of items from this place and time that have been treated in this way. ""The examples we see from this region and era are conventional gild plating and mercury gilding,"" says Dr Craddock. ""There's never been any untouchable evidence to support the electroplating theory."" He suggests a cluster of the batteries, connected in parallel, may have been hidden inside a metal statue or idol. He thinks that anyone touching this statue may have received a tiny but noticeable electric shock, something akin to the static discharge that can infect offices, equipment and children's parties. ""I have always suspected you would get tricks done in the temple,"" says Dr Craddock. ""The statue of a god could be wired up and then the priest would ask you questions. ""If you gave the wrong answer, you'd touch the statue and would get a minor shock along with perhaps a small mysterious blue flash of light. Get the answer right, and the trickster or priest could disconnect the batteries and no shock would arrive - the person would then be convinced of the power of the statue, priest and the religion."" It is said that to the uninitiated, science cannot be distinguished from magic. ""In Egypt we know this sort of thing happened with Hero's engine,"" Dr Craddock says. Hero's engine was a primitive steam-driven machine, and like the battery of Baghdad, no one is quite sure what it was used for, but are convinced it could work. If this idol could be found, it would be strong evidence to support the new theory. With the batteries inside, was this object once revered, like the Oracle of Delphi in Greece, and ""charged"" with godly powers? Even if the current were insufficient to provide a genuine shock, it may have felt warm, a bizarre tingle to the touch of the unsuspecting finger. At the very least, it could have just been the container of these articles, to keep their secret safe. Perhaps it is too early to say the battery has been convincingly demonstrated to be part of a magical ritual. Further examination, including accurate dating, of the batteries' components are needed to really answer this mystery. No one knows if such an idol or statue that could have hidden the batteries really exists, but perhaps the opportunity to look is not too far away - if the items survive the looming war in the Middle East. ""These objects belong to the successors of the people who made them,"" says Dr Craddock. ""Let's hope the world manages to resolve its present problems so people can go and see them.""

The 27-year-old Grammy-Award winning singer delivered a brief bow as he was led from Manhattan criminal court.  Lil Wayne, who has vowed to keep writing while behind bars, had already said goodbye to his fans during recent concerts and in video messages posted online.  ""He knew what he had to do, and he's doing it,"" said his lawyer, Stacey Richman.  The star - real name Dwayne Carter - could be released in about eight months if he behaves well, reports suggest.

498,"                           The German motor-racing driver, Michael Schumacher, has been stripped of his second place in the 1997 Formula One championship. But he will start next season with a clean sheet after a being involved in a collision with championship rival Jacques Villeneuve in the final race of 1997. The International Automobile Federation (FIA) disciplinary hearing in Slough, in the English county of Berkshire, disqualified him from the 1997 championship as punishment for his behaviour in the final race of the season. But it did not impose a fine or ban for next year. The FIA's 24-man council blamed him for causing a collision with Canadian Villeneuve, in the championship decider at Jerez in Spain last month. Schumacher, a former world champion who drives for Ferrari, admitted making a mistake and accepted the penalty. He had defended himself by claiming his move was the result of an instinctive error of judgement. The smash ended in failure for Schumacher, who spun out while Villeneuve drove on to finish third behind the McLarens of Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard. That was enough to seal the title. The FIA decided that Schumacher deliberately tried to ram Villeneuve to try to gain an advantage, but it did not ban or fine the German. The FIA President, Max Mosley, said his panel did not think it would be appropriate to ban Schumacher from the 1998 Championship. Mr Mosley said: ""The World Motorsport Council have carefully considered all the evidence in relation to the incident and have concluded that although the actions were deliberate they were not premeditated."" Villeneuve's Williams' team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who finished third in the championship, has been promoted into the runners-up spot. After the hearing Schumacher said the last two weeks had been ""fairly tough"" not just because of the negative publicity he received but also as he had gone into the race ""confident"" of winning the championship. He said: ""It was something not very easy to live with ... Two or three days after the race I really started to struggle with it and had some bad nights sleeping and accepting what I had done, which is not usual for myself, but obviously I am as much a human being as anyone."" He thanked the Ferrari team for its continuing support: ""We have learnt. We have made mistakes. But we will become stronger and I hope we will become better in the future."" Schumacher has a history of being involved in controversial collisions throughout his career. In the final heat of the 1990 Macau Grand Prix, a Formula Three event, he smashed into Hakkinen's car and removed him from the race which he went on to win. One year later, he collided with Briton Derek Warwick in a Group C sports car event in Germany after which the British driver had to be restrained from punching him. In 1992, he was grabbed by the throat by Ayrton Senna after an altercation during testing in advance of the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim. And in 1994, Schumacher was involved in an acrimonious collision with Briton Damon Hill at the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide where both drivers retired. The crash secured him his first world drivers' title, but left him with a tarnished reputation.                  "
499,"Jim Morris, head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said he expected food aid to reach almost all survivors within the next seven days.  More than 150,000 people have been killed across Asia. The UN has warned that the toll could rise further as a result of hunger and disease.  But no major outbreaks have been reported so far.  The BBC's Matt Frei says officials in a number of refugee camps in Sri Lanka have told him that disease is being contained and people are recovering.  The WFP head told the BBC that aid had reached ""nearly everyone who has been harmed by the disaster"".  ""Through our partners, a good many NGOs, we've found ways to get food to everyone who's in need,"" he said.  He said the agency was feeding 750,000 people in Sri Lanka, and up to 150,000 in Indonesia - primarily in Aceh province, the worst-hit by the earthquake and the tsunami on 26 December.  ""Our job is to get food to people to save lives, to address the special nutritional issues relating to women who are pregnant, nursing, and to young children.""  Mr Morris said he was optimistic the agency would have everything it needed - an estimated $280m ""for food for the next six months, to feed two million people, and for the logistics transport component"".  Food distribution to Indonesia, the worst-hit country, is expected to speed up following the opening of a humanitarian air hub at Subang near the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Friday.  It takes almost twice as long to reach the hard-hit province of Aceh from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, as it does from Subang."
500,"Many were hurt when they jumped from the windows of the five-storey hostel as flames rose from the first floor.  ""There was just no other way to get out of there - it was horrific,"" a Liberian told Russian media as other students frantically sought news of friends.  Moscow's mayor said the fire seemed to have been sparked by a short circuit.  One of the two emergency stairways out of the hostels was kept permanently shut, survivors said.  The casualties include students from across the globe, from Ethiopia to Ecuador, but the largest group are Chinese, with the foreign ministry in Beijing reporting that five had been killed and 17 were missing.  Vietnam said one of its nationals had died, and 10 others were injured.  They would have been enrolling for courses at the Russian Friendship of the Peoples University - the successor to the Communist-era Patrice Lumumba University, which trained foreign engineers and doctors.  Four of the dead may be Russian citizens, local media report, and the casualties also include students from the ex-Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan.  The fire swept through one wing of the hostel where 272 students were registered as living at the time.  The dilapidated hostel serves as a quarantine facility for foreign students who have just arrived in Russia and are undergoing medical checks before starting their studies.  'We could do nothing'  Survivors said the fire broke out at about 0200 on Monday (2300 GMT on Sunday) in two rooms on the first floor and spread rapidly to the rest of the building.  ""It was like a horrible nightmare,"" said Abdallah Bong, a student from Chad, as he surveyed the charred building on Monday morning.  ""We saw them crying for help and jumping out of the windows and we could do nothing to save them.""  Emergency services found 28 bodies inside the building and four outside. One person died on the way to hospital and three died later of their injuries.  Of the remaining injured, 10 were in a ""very serious"" condition, doctors said on Monday evening, and 47 in a ""serious"" condition.  Emergency services are said to have identified all but 15 of the bodies recovered but have not released details of the dead specifically.  The home countries given for the dead and injured as a whole are: China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Angola, Ivory Coast, Tahiti, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Dominican Republic, Lebanon, Peru, Malaysia, Mongolia, India, Nigeria, Tanzania and Sri Lanka, and Palestinians were also included on the list.  The Bangladeshi Ambassador to Moscow, Nazimullah Chaudhury, told the BBC that five out of 12 Bangladeshi students in the hostel were missing in the immediate aftermath of the fire.  Russian reports said an unspecified number of Japanese were among the injured.  Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said that, according to a preliminary investigation, the fire resulted from a short circuit in a room on the second floor while other reports speak of an accident with a heater.  He says that low safety standards and buildings in a bad state of repair are almost always to blame.  The hostel was built in 1966 and is one of 12 at the university.  The university itself was founded in 1960 under Nikita Khrushchev and was once a showcase university, where students from poorer nations could receive a subsidised education.  When the Soviet Union collapsed, the university was renamed but its buildings have since fallen into disrepair.  The university continues to offer a wide range of courses, as evidenced by its website, and has an annual student population of about 10,000 from more than 114 countries.  Were you caught up in the fire?  Use the form to tell us your experiences, some of which will be published below.  I am a student at that university and this is the second fire in this year. I think this fire is very strange because it happened very fast and if the fire generated in a room why did every room immediately begin burning? I have a compatriot who has died, from Ecuador, and the First Aid was late. I think the Authorities must investigate this deeply because days before there was a bomb alert, but they did not find anything.   Jexy Cobena, Ecuador  I stayed in a similar place just down the road from there in the 90s. We were horrified to find cookers with gas rings constantly alight because the knobs had gone missing. Some floors' kitchens even had their windows open, so if the wind blew up strongly enough and put out the flame, it would only take a smoker to walk into the room to cause a lethal accident. I am surprised it took so long for this to happen.  Raymond Goslitski, Belgium  Not every building is in disrepair at Friendship of the Peoples University. There is, in fact, a brand new dormitory but it seems to be used by students who have already been at the university for some time. The older dorms, especially for foreign students, are in disrepair. The living conditions for these older dorms are very, very utilitarian.  Dan, USA  I am a student studying in that university. Last night we experienced everything. The fire started at around 2.00 am and Russian fire fighters came at a round 3.00 am and only one ambulance came there to help. There was only a small fire in the second floor which could have been easily extinguished. But I believe the rescuers came too late.  The building is a very old one. Built in 1960s with no security, no fire extinguishers and in a horrible condition. The university does lots of advertisements in Mauritius, showing big good rooms with tv, telephone and separate bathrooms and toilets, but when we came here we never saw like this.  Vashish, Mauritius  This university is over-enrolled with authorities not caring about the standards of hostels, they are only interested in money, this is a wake up call to all universities in Russian Federation, students pay a lot of money but they live in very poor conditions, with no one to care, they should make sure that all rooms are properly heated, otherwise this is just a start of many more fires to come.  Chisha, Zambia/Russia  I stayed at Friendship of the Peoples University's international dormitory for several nights in 1999. It is a miracle that more people have not died already - no safety procedures, no fire escapes, possible escape routes chained shut, elevators - the list goes on.  Ben H. Fatherree, US  As an ex/pat who has worked in Moscow for 10 years, this episode sadly comes as no great surprise. The poor level of maintenance not only affects student accommodation, but most residential housing as well. I know of numerous people who have had fires at home caused by faulty electrics. For some reason the local authorities cannot/will not spend money for improvements. I fear that other such incidents will continue to happen. The more international publicity the better, maybe the authorities will start to wake up and do something.  Simon Gibbons, Russia/UK  I was fortunately not involved in this tragic accident, but as a former resident of Moscow student accommodation this was a disaster waiting to happen, not just for students but for ordinary Russian people whose homes are of similar Khrushchev design. Fires are the greatest domestic hazard in Russia due to the lack of maintenance and adequate fire safety precautions. I am just sorry it has taken a tragedy affecting countries across the globe to raise the issue of safety in the Russian home.  Iain, UK  I was not caught up in the fire, but having lived in Russia as a foreign student a year ago, I empathise with those who were affected by the tragic events in Moscow today, and feel deeply for the friends and families of the students who lost their lives. Although the official statement is that the fire was most likely caused by an electrical fault, I do hope that thorough investigation will follow. Anti-foreign sentiment in Russia can be strong, and the death of 32, mostly foreign, students should not be lightly compared to similar fire outbreaks in the past. This event should shed light to the fact that foreign residents, and especially those of non-Caucasian origin, face serious threats living in the country. It is high time Russia dealt seriously with the problem of violence against foreigners. Let us not all turn a blind eye to the problem by denying that this event is not one that deserves immediate and rigorous scrutiny.

502,"The new bone was created from bone marrow stem cells Scientists have created part of the jaw joint in the lab using human adult stem cells. They say it is the first time a complex, anatomically-sized bone has been accurately created in this way. It is hoped the technique could be used not only to treat disorders of the specific joint, but more widely to correct problems with other bones too. The Columbia University study appears in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The bone which has been created in the lab is known as the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The availability of personalized bone grafts engineered from the patient's own stem cells would revolutionise the way we currently treat these defects    Problems with the joint can be the result of birth defects, arthritis or injury. Although they are widespread, treatment can be difficult. The joint has a complex structure which makes it difficult to repair by using grafts from bones elsewhere in the body. The latest study used human stem cells taken from bone marrow. These were seeded into a tissue scaffold, formed into the precise shape of the human jaw bone by using digital images from a patient. The cells were then cultured using a specially-designed bioreactor which was able to infuse the growing tissue with exactly the level of nutrients found during natural bone development. Lead researcher Dr Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic said: ""The availability of personalised bone grafts engineered from the patient's own stem cells would revolutionise the way we currently treat these defects."" Dr Vunjak-Novakovic said the new technique could also be applied to other bones in the head and neck, including skull bones and cheek bones, which are similarly difficult to graft. The option to engineer anatomically pieces of human bone in this way could potentially transform the ability to carry out reconstruction work, for instance following serious injury or cancer treatment. She said: ""We thought the jawbone would be the most rigorous test of our technique; if you can make this, you can make any shape."" She stressed that the joint created in the lab was bone only, and did not include other tissue, such as cartilage. However, the Columbia team is working on a new method for engineering hybrid grafts including bone and cartilage. Another major challenge for scientists will be to find a way to engineer bone with a blood supply that can be easily connected to the blood supply of the host. Professor Anthony Hollander, a tissue engineering expert from the University of Bristol who helped produce an artificial windpipe last year, said there was still a lot of work to be done before the new bone could be used on patients. But he said: ""One of the major problems facing scientists in this field is how to engineer a piece of bone with the right dimensions - that is critical for some of these bone defects. ""This is a lovely piece of tissue engineering which has produced bone with a high degree of accuracy in terms of shape.""     "
503,"Council chiefs hope Mick and Keith could return to the resort More than four decades after their gig at the Empress Ballroom finished in a riot, The Rolling Stones are finally being allowed back into Blackpool. The former hell raisers were given an indefinite ban from the resort in 1964 after fans stormed the stage. More than 50 people were taken to hospital after fans ripped up seats, threw bottles and smashed a piano. But now council chiefs are writing to the Stones saying it is all over now - and have invited them back. The band were bundled off stage as the ballroom erupted in violence, believed to have started after a member of the 7,000-strong crowd spat at guitarist Brian Jones. Historian Terry Regan, who was in the audience, said: ""Although I was a young bloke at the time I was quite scared. Fans were determined to touch the band, a witness says ""There was a mass rush for the stage. ""There was a group of people, probably two or three hundred, determined to lay hands on the Rolling Stones."" The Stones tried to return to the resort a year after the incident to play at a different venue. But the police watch committee refused them a licence, saying there would be too much trouble - a ban which has effectively kept the band out of the resort ever since. However, it's a situation that current council leader Peter Callow would like to see remedied to bring some glamour back to the resort. ""I've given instruction to our council officers to write to The Rolling Stones to say: 'Right, the ban is lifted. We reach out the hand of friendship.' ""What I am saying is: 'Come back Mick, all is forgiven.'"" The Rolling Stones have not commented on the lifting of the ban.     "
504,"Women's groups in the southern Indian state of Kerala have criticised the legendary singer KJ Yesudas for saying women should not wear jeans.  The singer said that wearing jeans was ""against Indian culture"" and provoked ""undesirable"" behaviour.  He is popular for singing Indian classical and devotional songs and has won several prestigious music awards.  But his comments prompted several groups to lead protest marches in the state capital, Trivandrum.  ""Women should not wear jeans and trouble others. You should dress modestly and do not behave like men,"" the singer told a gathering at the Swati Thirunal College of Music in the state capital, Trivandrum, on Thursday.  ""People would be tempted to pay attention to what's beyond it... Don't do it to attract and make others do the undesirable,"" he said, drawing applause from a section of the male audience.  ""Whatever should be covered, should be covered. We appreciate what's concealed and that's our culture,"" he added.  By Friday morning #Yesudas was making an appearance among Indians on Twitter.  They responded with a mixture of despair, outrage but some expressed their support for his position.  Activist Kavita Krishnan suggested he cover his eyes rather than ask women to cover up. Others he suggested he cover his mouth.  But there were also some tweets that said he was merely speaking out in defence of Indian traditions.  One user, Shyam, tweeted that Yesudas has the right to state his views and was an ""elderly person with wisdom"".  Women in both the state's ruling Congress party and the opposition Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) have condemned the remarks and asked the singer to withdraw them and apologise.  The Congress party's Bindu Krishna said the singer's comments were ""immature"" and ""vulgar"" while CPI(M) MP TN Seema said they smacked of ""perversion"" and insulted Kerala's achievements in gender equality.  ""This is really shocking! If this is the attitude of a cultural icon like him, there's some serious trouble with our society,"" Ms Seema told BBC."
505,"As president from 1989 to 2003, Mr Jiang took the helm of the world's largest country in the wake of the Tiananmen Square killings.  When he came to power, China was a virtual pariah state. By the time he had handed the presidency over to Hu Jintao, it had become the fastest-growing economy in the world.  Mr Jiang's rise to power stemmed from a politburo purge of liberal leaders in 1989, after the ruthless suppression of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.  Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who held all the real power, needed to find a new protégé to lead the Communist Party.  Mr Jiang, who as Shanghai party chief had weathered the student protests without resorting to violence, fitted the bill.  By the time Deng finally died in February 1997, Jiang Zemin had been given enough time to establish himself.  But he also attempted to make his mark as a political thinker, alongside Mao and Deng, by expounding the three representations theory - an attempt to modernise the Party.  The theory says the Party should further the development of ""advanced social productive forces"" [allow entrepreneurs and professionals membership of the party], develop culture, and represent the majority of the people.  Jiang Zemin was born to an intellectual family and graduated as an electrical engineer. He had previously worked in a Soviet car factory and as a diplomat in Romania in the 1950s.  He served as minister in charge of the electronics industry and as mayor and party chief in Shanghai.  He likes to recite poetry and plays the piano as well as an erhu, a two-stringed instrument similar to the violin.  Former US ambassador to Beijing James Lilley recalls that Jiang was known as The Flowerpot by the people of Shanghai: ''Lots of decoration, no action.""  ""Well, it turns out he is a good consensus builder, he's a good manipulator,"" Mr Lilley said.  He has been credited with squeezing as much advantage as possible from events - such as the spy plane crisis or the Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade - but always allowing US ties to recover.  This was especially illustrated in the co-operation offered by China for Washington's ""war on terror"" following 11 September 2001.  Mr Jiang began the leadership transition to Mr Hu in November 2002, when he gave the younger man the post of party chief.  Mr Hu succeeded him as president in March 2003.  But until September 2004, Mr Jiang remained chairman of the commission which oversees China's armed forces, and retained a huge influence over foreign policy and security issues.  Mr Jiang is likely to remain fairly influential, even without an official post, because the high echelons of Chinese politics are still filled with his allies.  And Mr Jiang's supporters will work hard to protect his legacy and his family interests.  His son, Jiang Mianheng, has been called the ""Prince of Information Technology"".  The US-educated entrepreneur is chairman of the state-run China Netcom and is also in partnership with Taiwanese tycoon Winston Wong to build a $1.6 billion semiconductor plant in Shanghai."
506,"BBC Three, the UK's latest digital channel, has been launched by presenter Johnny Vaughan with a range of programming aimed at the 25-34 age group.  The channel, which was previously known as BBC Choice, offers a mix of comedy, documentaries, celebrity profiles, news and niche programming from 7pm.  Among the stars appearing on the first transmission, were comedian Johnny Vegas, Justin Timberlake and former royal butler Paul Burrell.  It will broadcast from 7pm to 4am each day, and be available on cable, satellite and Freeview.  BBC Three controller Stuart Murphy described the channel as ""television's boldest single investment in the future of Britain's creative talent"".  He added that it would bring a ""distinctive new voice to a generation of young adults"".  ""It is the only channel aimed at people in their 20s and 30s which offers a genuinely mixed schedule of quality, home grown programmes - 90% of the output will be made in the UK,"" he said.  ""In every programme, whether it's science, arts, comedy, current affairs, drama, news, documentaries or animation, it will be BBC Three's job to raise the creative game for this audience.""  BBC Three replaced BBC Choice, but did not get the go-ahead until Culture Minister Tessa Jowell agreed it was ""distinctive"" enough.  She rejected the channel's first application for a digital licence, but accepted the second last September.  The government will review the channel again in 2004 to make sure it is keeping to its brief.  Part of the channel's remit is to meet certain minimum levels of arts, current affairs, business and religious programming.  Its current affairs include 60 Seconds, an hourly news bulletin that delivers five news stories in one minute.  It will also feature entertainment programmes such as Celebdaq, an interactive show where viewers buy and sell celebrities based on how many column inches they generate in the week's news.  Lisa Faulkner and former Spice Girl Mel B will star in the series Burn It, a Manchester-based drama which addresses the issues of hitting 30.  The launch will include a brand new comedy series, Swiss Toni, a spin off from the Fast Show featuring Charlie Higson as the eponymous used car dealer.  And a new series of Johnny Vaughan Tonight, the chat show hosted by the former Big Breakfast host, will also form part of the line-up."
507,"The sound of the chain would frighten people so much that they would stop in their tracks only to be caught by the dog. The dog would then circle its victim at great speed in order to terrify them further.  No bodily harm was ever done to the victims but they were usually found cowering against a hedge in a state of shock after their encounter with the Black Dog. Due to this, the slightest mention that the dog had been heard was enough to send people hurrying back to their homes.  But did the dog ever exist, or did smugglers make him up, so that scared parishioners wouldn't see them landing secret stores of brandy and tobacco?  It is still said that if you do see Le Chien de Bouley, there will be a storm."
508,"The American intelligence agency, the CIA, could have prevented the 11 September attacks if it were not for systematic failures, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit.  The paper has uncovered details of a major Israeli spy ring involving some a 120 agents for the intelligence service Mossad operating across America and some masquerading as arts students.  The ring was reportedly hard on the heels of at least four members of the hijack gang, including its leader Mohammed Atta.  But the Israeli agents were detected by their American counterparts and thrown out of the country, it says.  The US authorities said then that they were students whose visas had expired.  Just a month before the deadly attacks, the paper said, Mossad handed over to the Americans a detailed report naming several suspects they believe were preparing an attack on the United States.  But it contained no specific indications as to the objective and it was not treated seriously.  The paper also claims that the CIA failed to inform the German authorities that Ramzi Binalshibh, a key logistics man for the attacks, had attended a high level meeting of al-Qaeda activists in Malaysia over 18 months before 11 September.  Without that information the Germans could not prevent him re-entering the country and contacting the Hamburg cell that was planning the hijackings."
509,"He admitted breaking the speed limit in his new £200,000 turbo-charged Bentley, after being caught doing 92mph on a road in Somerset, south-west England, last month.  Magistrates in Yeovil also fined him £400, with £35 costs.  Mansell, who is a special constable with the Devon and Cornwall police force, was not in court.  Last July, the motor racing star helped to launch a learner driver training package from the RAC.  It included a video of winter driving techniques and advice on how to avoid crashes.  Mansell can stay on the race track  Although Mansell is obliged to inform race organisers of the ban, it will not affect his eligibility to take part in off-road motor sports.  The RAC Motor Sports Association, the UK governing body responsible for all competition driving licences, only bans drivers in extreme circumstances such as drink-driving or a conviction for dangerous driving.  ""We certainly don't condone any action that breaks the law,"" said its spokesman, Colin Wilson.  ""It is often said that someone of Nigel's talent driving at 100mph would be safer than you or I doing 50mph but the law has been broken so he has to be punished.""  Road safety campaigners criticised Mansell for speeding, saying he risked encouraging other motorists to flout speed limits.  Roger Vincent, senior spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: ""There are already enough people using Britain's roads as race tracks - what we don't want is the professionals joining them.  ""Nigel Mansell is an undoubted expert in his field but something like this is setting an extremely bad example, particularly to young people who will regard him as something of a hero.""  Department of Transport figures show that 57% of drivers regularly exceed the 70mph limit on motorways. A further 19% drive at more than 80mph on dual carriageways."

511,"Police say a car bomb which exploded outside the BBC's main news centre in London was the work of an Irish dissident group. The blast rocked the White City area of West London at 0030GMT on Sunday, spraying debris over a large area. The device went off as bomb squad officers tried to carry out a controlled explosion on a taxi left near Television Centre. Staff had already been evacuated after police received a coded warning.    I can only fear that we will see more attacks    One London Underground worker suffered deep cuts to his eye from flying glass and some damage was caused to the front of the building. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Branch, said it was ""clearly a big device"", which contained high explosives. He said he believed dissident Irish Republican group, the Real IRA, was responsible for the attack. The warning was received by a London hospital and an unnamed charitable trust at around 2320GMT on Saturday. It was the same codeword used when a device was planted on the railway line at Acton, west London, last year. Mr Fry said: ""Bomb disposal officers from the Metropolitan Police attended the scene within 20 minutes of the original call. ""They started to attempt to do a controlled explosion but while they were carrying out those procedures the bomb exploded."" He said the explosion was an escalation of the Real IRA's terror campaign on mainland Britain. It is believed to be the first such attack on the BBC. 20 Sept 2000 Dissident Irish republicans were the main suspects in the ""rocket"" attack on the MI6 spy headquarters in central London. 19 July 2000    The Real IRA was understood to have been responsible for a bomb near Ealing Broadway tube station 1 June 2000    A device found on Hammersmith Bridge. No one claimed responsibility Mr Fry said: ""We have been predicting, since Christmas, that the mainland, and London in particular, were to be subject to terrorist attacks. This was one of those attacks."" Anti-terrorist branch officers are carrying out forensic tests in the Wood Lane area of Shepherd's Bush and the road is expected to remain sealed off to traffic on Sunday. The BBC's Laurie Margolis was on the roof of Television Centre and saw the explosion go off. He said: ""There was an explosion and a huge bang."" A BBC spokesman said: ""We evacuated the main building and put our emergency plans into action. Broadcasting on channels has remained throughout the incident."" The BBC said it was handing over CCTV tapes from around the building to the police. Richard Sambrook, director of BBC News, said security had been stepped up on Sunday, and the need for further precautions was being reviewed. He told the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme: ""The BBC is a very high profile organisation and that may well be the reason for it."" Terrorist attacks on the media were rare and so the bomb marked a significant change, he said.    There was a huge orange fireball and a pall of smoke which, even in the night sky, was visible    ""What we are all asking ourselves is whether this is simply a general change in tactics in some way, or whether there is something specific behind this particular attack and we simply don't know at the moment."" The Central and Metropolitan and City Underground lines were likely to be closed in the area, a police spokesman added. Police said they were keeping an open mind about those responsible. They were also keeping an open mind about possible links between the blast and the explosion at a nearby Territorial Army barracks in February, which blinded a 14-year-old cadet. Stephen Menary's also had his left hand blown off by a bomb packed inside a torch at the TA centre in South Africa Road, Shepherd's Bush. Police have appealed for anyone with information to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789321."
512,"Mijailo Mijailovic rocked slightly in his chair as he described how he saw Ms Lindh out shopping and ""couldn't resist the voices"".  Mr Mijailovic's lawyer said his client, who denies murder, admitted stabbing Ms Lindh, but did not intend to kill her.  The foreign minister, one of Sweden's most popular politicians, was stabbed as she was shopping in a Stockholm department store on 10 September last year. She died in hospital the following day.  The trial was being broadcast live on Swedish radio, with millions of people expected to tune in. But after a break for lunch, the court ruled that the cross-examination of Mr Mijailovic should not be broadcast after a request from the accused.  Ms Lindh, a leading pro-Euro campaigner, was killed just days before a divisive referendum in Sweden on whether to join the single European currency.  But Mr Mijailovic, 25, told the court he did not single out Ms Lindh because she was a politician.  ""I'm not interested in politics,"" he said. ""It could have been someone other than Anna Lindh. I have nothing personal against Anna Lindh.""  Mr Mijailovic said he had left home with a knife because he felt threatened. He said he ended up wandering aimlessly around the department store before he saw Ms Lindh but rejected any suggestion that he had been looking for her.  Prosecutors say the attack was planned and believe Mr Mijailovic stalked the politician for 14 minutes before stabbing her.  ""I could not withstand the voice - it said 'attack, attack',"" he said.  He said the attack ""lasted only a few seconds"".  ""It's like a nightmare,"" he said. ""It happened so quickly. I took out the knife, then I attacked her. I don't know how many times I stabbed.""  Mr Majailovic said he ""did not aim"" for any particular part of her body.  He said that after the attack, he was worried about what had happened.  ""I was hoping that she would survive,"" he said.  He said he was ""feeling really bad and hadn't slept for days"" before the incident.  Mr Mijailovic gave a rambling confession to police last week, saying Jesus had told him to stab Ms Lindh.  His defence lawyer, Peter Althin, told the court he wanted the charges reduced from murder to manslaughter.  Chief prosecutor Agneta Blidberg told the court that she would prove Mr Mijailovic had every intention of killing Ms Lindh.  If convicted of murder, he faces a life sentence, which in Sweden is usually about 15 years.  At the end of the trial early next week, Mr Mijailovic is expected to undergo four weeks of psychiatric assessment, after which a verdict can be passed."
513,"A block of houses built to re-home people after World War II is to be saved from demolition by moving to a new home at a museum.  Airey houses were prefabricated homes constructed in great numbers at the end of the war as a temporary replacement for homes destroyed by bombs.  Designed by Sir Edwin Airey, they were intended as a temporary measure, but many still remain in use.  Now, a block of four Airey houses in Kibblesworth is being resurrected at the Beamish Museum in County Durham instead of being destroyed.  The houses were recently vacated and were due for demolition, when The Gateshead Housing Company offered the whole block to Beamish.  Richard Evans, director at Beamish Museum, said: ""People shouldn't look down upon nostalgia, that connection back to previous generations is really important.  ""Understanding your grandparents' generation, you know the improvement to the quality of life shouldn't be forgotten, the space, the gardens, the quality of light inside, people had a real improvement in their daily life.""  Featuring a frame of prefabricated concrete columns clad with a series concrete panels, to move them to their new home they will be deconstructed and loaded onto pallets.  They will then be transported and stored at the museum to be used in a new north-eastern post-war urban development there.  Beamish is planning to build a 1950s exhibition which will be added to the existing Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian areas.  As well as appropriate buildings, it is anticipated that the collecting of 1950s artefacts will commence later this year.  ""The 1950s area is still very much in the planning stage, we'll be launching the collections project later in the year.  ""The Airey houses tell a major part of the 1950s story, so we have taken the opportunity to collect them whilst we can - we may not have got a second chance,"" said Mr Evans.  Mary Gardner's family was one of the first to move into the houses in Kibblesworth and lived in a prefab house for 17 years.  She said she was glad to be moving into a more modern house as the prefab was ""very cold"".  ""All my childhood was spent in one of those... everybody knew everybody, you knew everybody that lived in every house in Kibblesworth and everybody always helped each other, it was a nice place to be brought up.  ""At the time everybody thought they were marvellous because they had indoor toilets... they were very updated then,"" Ms Gardener said.  Speaking about her home being moved to Beamish, she said: ""It will be looking into the past, some of the cottages that are there, my mum was brought up in one like that... so it's like going down through history.  ""It keeps part of your childhood memories alive if you can go up there and look at it.""  The first parts of the houses will arrive later this week and the whole deconstruction project will be completed by late June."
514,"The drummer of Scottish rock band Travis has suffered a suspected spinal injury in a swimming pool accident.  Other members of the band rushed to pull Neil Primrose out of the water after the accident in France.  He was taken to a local hospital in Belfort and the band's management said ""early indications"" were that he had broken a vertebra.  The management said Primrose struck his head and was rendered unconscious in the accident.  Fellow band and crew members, who had also been relaxing by the pool after a week of European festival appearances, went to his aid and he was taken away by ambulance to hospital where he has been undergoing tests.  The group's management issued a statement which said: ""Whilst relaxing in the pool, Travis drummer Neil Primrose struck his head and was knocked unconscious.  ""After realising his predicament, other band and crew members dragged Neil from the pool and gave him assistance.  ""He was taken by ambulance to the local hospital in Belfort to receive treatment and to undergo tests.  ""Early indications suggest that Neil has sustained a fracture on one of his vertebrae and is still in hospital in France undergoing further tests.""  Speaking to the Scottish Sun from hospital, Primrose said things cold have been ""a lot worse"" if he had struck his head a different way.  ""We went back to the hotel for a couple of beers and I dived into the pool. It was too shallow and I bumped my head and knocked myself out,"" he told the newspaper.  ""The guys had been watching me but then realised it looked a bit more serious.  ""I was floating beneath the surface of the water. They pretty much jumped in and got me out.""  The band's management said the accident has forced Travis to cancel its forthcoming concerts.  ""We wish to apologise to all our fans for any inconvenience caused but hope you will join us in wishing Neil a full and speedy recovery,"" said the statement.  Full refunds would be offered for all of the cancelled concerts, apart from Carhaix which is a three-day festival.  The management stressed that David Bowie would still be appearing at Lucca."
515,"Edward Heath has become the new British prime minister after a surprise victory for the Conservatives in the general election.  The result has confounded all opinion polls conducted before yesterday's election which had predicted a comfortable win for Labour.  But with all 630 seats now declared the Conservatives have won 330 seats, giving them a majority of 30. Labour have won 287 seats.  The new prime minister, Edward Richard George Heath, who has led the Conservative party since 1965, has pledged to ""restore honesty to government and integrity to politics"" and bring to an end what he referred to as ""six long years of hard labour"".  The outgoing prime minister, Harold Wilson, refused to admit defeat until the last minute.  But just after 1400 hrs today, when the Conservatives reached the required majority of 316 seats, he requested an audience with the Queen to tender his resignation.  Shortly afterwards the Queen invited Mr Heath to Buckingham Palace where she asked him to form a new administration.  Edward Heath was born in Broadstairs on 9 July 1916 and was educated at Oxford university, before becoming MP for Bexley in 1950.  A confirmed bachelor, he has a passion for yachting and classical music.  Throughout the past three weeks, during which all the party leaders have toured the length and breadth of Britain on their arduous election campaign trails, Edward Heath, 53, has consistently offered the British people a new style of government.  As well as his commitment to European unity, he has promised to reduce taxes, cut down on wild-cat strikes by updating the law on industrial relations, and give more help to the poor, the old and the sick by concentrating government subsidies on those that need them most.  As he arrived at Downing Street this evening he was given a rapturous welcome. Huge crowds, who had gathered throughout the afternoon, sang ""For he's a jolly good fellow"" and shouted ""Good old Ted.""  In an interview with the BBC, the defeated Harold Wilson said he had always admired Edward Heath although he had not agreed with many of his election tactics, including the Conservatives' attempt to ""drag sterling into the campaign.""  Devaluation of the pound has remained a controversial issue for both the main parties.  But Mr Wilson said Mr Heath would now have the strongest economic position any prime minister had taken over in living memory.  He suggested the low turn-out of voters - just 70% - may have contributed to his defeat: ""We were up against something that no-one foresaw. (...) It was a low poll and a low poll is going to count against us. All the signs were of a high poll.""  Mr Wilson and his family left Downing Street via a back door this afternoon and went to Chequers, the Prime Minister's country seat, where they will remain until they find alternative accommodation in London."
516,"Health Secretary John Reid tasked NHS hospitals with achieving a year on year reduction up to and beyond March 2008.  But official rates show year on year increases in England since measurement began in 2001.  Critics said more resources would be needed to meet the ambitious target.  The National Audit Office estimates infections such as MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) kill 5,000 people each year.  Between April 2003 and March 2004 MRSA blood infections increased by 3.6% from 7,384 to 7,647.  But the NAO says incomplete data means the crisis cannot be accurately assessed and the true figure could be much higher.  Some of the highest rates were in the country's most prestigious specialist hospitals.  In July, Mr Reid introduced a number of measures to tackle MRSA.  Trusts now have to meet national standards, and be inspected to see how successful they are in reducing hospital acquired infection rates.  Those judged to be performing poorly on cleanliness have to provide an action plan for improvement within three weeks, followed up by a re-inspection within six weeks.  Matrons have been given direct responsibility for cleaning staff, and ensuring patients' views are taken on board.  New patient bedside phones are being introduced that include speed dial buttons to alert staff to the need to deal with a hygiene problem.  There will also be a summit involving the world's leading infection control experts to discuss how best to tackle the problem.  Mr Reed told the Chief Nursing Officer's conference in Manchester on Friday that although it would be challenging, the target was ""achievable, measurable and not too burdensome and will drive in its wake other sites of MRSA infection.""  He said: ""I expect MRSA bloodstream infection rates to be halved in our hospitals by 2008.  ""NHS Acute Trusts will be tasked with achieving a year on year reduction up to and beyond March 2008.  ""All trusts will have to identify high-risk sources of infection and draw up comprehensive action plans to prevent or isolate MRSA in order to achieve this reduction.  ""Everyone has a role to play - hospital cleaners are as important as consultants when it comes to these issues.""  But Dr Paul Grime from the British Medical Association questioned whether the target was achievable.  He said: ""I think it would be very difficult to predict on the evidence so far.  ""There's been a year on year increase of MRSA blood stream infections reported.  ""The NAO report showed despite all the initiatives that have been taken in the last few years there is still a lack of reliable information to measure progress and there didn't seem to be any demonstrable improvement.""  He said a number of issues needed to be addressed, including cleaning contracts, hand hygiene, antibiotic use and bed occupancy rates.  Jean Lawrence of the Infection Control Nurses Association said: ""We have not been consulted in regards to this ambitious and challenging target.  ""We look forward to talking to John Reid about the proposals being put forward.  ""To meet these expectations there will be a need to increase resources to infection control teams, including instigating a comprehensive national surveillance programme and empowerment of infection control nurses to do their job.""  Dr Mark Enright, Royal Society Research Fellow in the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at the University of Bath, said there was no evidence base that shows that better hygiene would reduce local or national MRSA rates.  Conservative Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: ""Whitehall targets have been a key cause in the proliferation of MRSA since 1997, and here we see the government setting another target.  ""As MRSA has doubled since 1997, halving it would bring us back to where we began.  ""This target is nothing but all talk and it will achieve little to combat the wider issue of hospital-acquired infections.""  Lib Dem Shadow Health Secretary Paul Burstow said: ""Halving a problem, when you don't really know the scale of the problem, is an extraordinary feat.  ""Until the government own up to the fact that they still do not know the true level of hospital infections and take the steps to find out, patients should take this announcement with a pinch of salt.""  The Healthcare Commission said it would carry out reviews on cleanliness and hospital acquired infection with a view to identifying good practice and driving improvement where there is still more work to be done.  At the same conference on Thursday, the new Chief Nursing Officer Chris Beasley announced more than a million NHS staff will receive infection control training to help fight MRSA."
517,"Hamilton was awarded top slot after being impeded by his McLaren team-mate in the pit lane, leaving him too little time to start his final lap.  McLaren will now not be allowed to score constructors' points.  Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella was also demoted five places to 13th for impeding Spyker's Sakon Yamamoto.  Fisichella's demotion leaves the reigning world champions without a car in the top half of the field for Sunday's race, while Japan's Yamamoto remains at the back.  McLaren have said they intend to appeal against the decision to prevent them scoring constructors' points.  As a result of Alonso's punishment, BMW Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld was bumped up to second place with Kimi Raikkonen third.  Ferrari's Felipe Massa, third in the championship and 11 points adrift of Hamilton, suffered a costly mix-up on his fuel levels and will start from 14th on the grid.  Hamilton leads Spaniard Alonso by two points with seven races remaining.  The 22-year-old British rookie was fastest until the Spaniard pipped him by 0.107 seconds with his final lap of the session in the dying seconds.  Hamilton was unable to reply after being forced to wait behind Alonso at their final stop, leaving him too little time for a final flying lap.  Alonso and Hamilton, as well as team principal Ron Dennis, were summoned to an FIA inquiry to explain why the Spaniard had stopped for such a long time.  ""The commissioners decided that Alonso unnecessarily interfered with another competitor, Hamilton, and he has been penalised five places on the grid,"" said an FIA statement.  ""The attitude of the team at the end of qualification was considered prejudicial to the interests of competition and motor racing.""  McLaren immediately appealed against the decision but this will only cover the withdrawal of constructors' points, not the personal penalty handed out to Alonso.  Hamilton refused to be drawn into criticising Alonso for delaying his exit out of the pit lane ahead of his final run.  ""There's not really much to say - you saw what happened,"" he said.  ""The team did a great job and we had very good pace, but I'm not aware of what happened. You should ask the team.""  When asked as to how long he missed out on setting a final quick lap, he tersely replied: ""About the same amount of time I was held up in the pit stop.""  Explaining the incident, Alonso said: ""The team was holding me back. We tried to have a little bit of space with the Ferrari (Raikkonen) in front of us.""  The delay in Alonso leaving his pit is said to have been caused by an argument between the Spaniard and his engineer about the type of tyres that had been fitted to his car.  McLaren released a statement on Sunday responding to the penalty. It seemed to lay the blame for delaying Hamilton on Alonso, and complained at the unfairness of being denied constructors' points.  ""The process of managing two such exceptional talents as Fernando and Lewis is made more challenging by having a race winning car,"" the statement read.  ""During this intense and frenetic period of qualifying, decisions are necessarily made in seconds to enable the drivers and the team to position their cars on the track at the optimal moment.  ""We agree with the stewards that, when the team decided to hold Fernando for 20 seconds, there were four cars on the circuit.  ""However, we do not understand the relevance of this observation as the team needed to estimate where all the remaining cars would be in the final minutes of the session.  ""Similarly the team does not agree with the statement of the stewards that the 20-second hold caused Lewis to be impeded.  ""Tensions were undeniably high and the problem at Fernando's first stop, the desire to enter a clear track and concerns expressed following the fitting of used tyres undoubtedly contributed to the delay in Fernando's ultimate departure.  ""We do not believe that the findings of the stewards and the severe penalty imposed on the team are appropriate, and that our strenuous efforts to maintain the spirit of fair play and equality within the team have been misunderstood.""  Briton Jenson Button, who took a first Grand Prix win from 14th place in a wet race in Hungary last year, qualified his Honda a disappointing 17th."
518,"Before every sitting of the House, the Speaker's procession leaves the Speaker's House inside the Palace of Westminster and heads for the Commons chamber.  The Serjeant at Arms, carrying the Mace, and a doorkeeper walk ahead of the Speaker. Some members of the Speaker's staff - his chaplain, secretary and a trainbearer - follow behind.  As the procession reaches the central lobby of the Houses of Parliament, one of the policemen on duty shouts: ""Hats Off Strangers!""  Then, policemen in helmets and any members of the public wearing hats are required to remove their headgear as the procession passes."
519,"Birmingham Airport is to spend £100m on new baggage handling systems and car parks.  Bosses want to upgrade the baggage screening systems so they can double the speed luggage can be processed.  They also want to create two new car parks including a new drop-off car park with a covered walkway to the terminal entrance.  Existing car parks will also be upgraded and the number of self-service bag drop kiosks will be doubled.  Airport chief executive Paul Kehoe said they wanted to improve improve efficiency ahead of new flights being added next year.  He said the airport currently caters for 11 million passengers annually but said he expected it to rise to 12 million next year.

520,"Veteran actress Madhuri Dixit, who made a grand Bollywood comeback in Yash Raj Films' 2007 dance musical Aaja Nachle (meaning 'come let us dance') will be conferred with the prestigious Padmashri Award for her invaluable contribution to Indian cinema this month.  She then went on to act in box office hits like Ram Lakhan (1989), Parinda (1989), Tridev (1989), Kishen Kanhaiya (1990), Dil (1990), Saajan (1991), Beta (1992), Khalnayak (1993) and the all-time Bollywood smash hit, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun! (1994) and also Raja (1995). All received popular screenings in Shropshire.  Madhuri further reaffirmed her acting prowess in Yash Chopra's blockbuster Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), for which she won a Filmfare Best Actress Award.  But it was not until 2002 that Madhuri won global fame for her work in director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas,  in which she shared screen space with the likes of Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai.  Her hard work paid off in the form of the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress award that year.  In 2007, she made a grand Bollywood comeback in Aaja Nachle. Although the film did not any break UK box office records, Madhuri's work was still appreciated by fans and critics alike.  This month, Madhuri Dixit will receive the Padmashri Award, rightly deserved for a Bollywood diva who has carved a small niche for herself in the history of Bollywood."
521,"It is 200 years since Napoleon backtracked on his grand scheme to make his empire metric, but today the British remain unique in Europe by holding onto imperial weights and measures. With the UK's relationship with its neighbours under scrutiny, can it ever adopt the metric mindset?  It's an existential question that reveals much about how you make sense of the world. Is your ballpoint pen 6in long or 15cm?  Do you buy petrol by the gallon or the litre? Cheese by the ounce or the gram? And just how far is Dover from Calais - 21 miles or 34km?  Call it a proud expression of national identity or a stubborn refusal to engage with the neighbours. Either way, the persistent British preference for imperial over metric is particularly noteworthy at a time when its links with Europe are under greater scrutiny than ever.  Supporters of traditional weights and measures may have rejoiced in 2007 when the European Commission announced it was dropping its attempts to bring the UK into line with the rest of the EU.  But a looming anniversary is a reminder to decimal sceptics and enthusiasts alike that successful resistance to metrication is not always permanent.  In February 1812, some 17 years after France first went metric, Napoleon I introduced a system for small businesses called mesures usuelles - French for customary measurements. These were based on the old, pre-revolutionary system, in response to the unpopularity of the new decimal codes.  Only after Napoleon's departure did France go fully metric in 1840, using the law to enforce metrication.  But if the French eventually learned to think in units of 10, the UK, so far, has not. All the evidence suggests that, despite more than decade-and-a-half of goods being labelled in both metric and imperial, the British remain defiantly out of step with their counterparts across the channel.  In May 2011, a survey by supermarket chain Asda suggested 70% of customers found metric labelling confusing and wanted products labelled in imperial instead. In response, the company reverted to selling strawberries by the pound for the first time in over a decade.  According to social historian Joe Moran, author of Queuing For Beginners, the notion that imperial measures embody tradition and reassurance accounts for much of their appeal to the British.  ""It may also have something to do with the poetic, concrete names used in the old imperial system, particularly for coins - tanner, half a crown, guinea, etc, that just seem more familiar, friendly and native than metrics.""  Nonetheless, the legal requirement to display measurements for most products in both systems means many Britons have become adept at making the mental switch from ounces to grams and back again.  Nowhere is this duality more apparent than in relation to alcohol. Imperial measurements for spirits were phased out in 1988. Yet it remains illegal to sell beer and cider in any other units than pints.  It is a discrepancy that is reportedly mirrored in the illegal drugs market, with cannabis typically sold in ounces while cocaine is packaged in grams.  However, support for traditional measurements has gone beyond shoppers merely expressing a consumer preference.  In 2001, grocer Steve Thoburn became a cause celebre - if French terms are not inappropriate in this context - after being convicted for using scales showing only imperial weights. The Metric Martyr group's appeals against conviction were rejected all the way up to the House of Lords and, in February 2004, by the European Court of Human Rights.  Given the widespread association in the UK between the metric system and the European Union, it's tempting to view the battle simply as an expression of hostility towards political integration.  For one of the Metric Martyrs, Neil Herron, however, it was primarily concerned with how we understand the world around us.  ""It's about the language and vernacular with which we relate to each other,"" he says. ""Even with kids who have been educated in metric for the past 30 years, watching a football match talk about a penalty kick being 12 yards or the striker being six foot tall.  ""It goes to the core of who we are. If we are going to change we will do it organically, with the consent of the people. We won't have it imposed.""  Despite its popular identification with European bureaucracy, British attempts to scrap imperial measurements stretch back long before the UK came under the jurisdiction of Brussels.  In 1863 the House of Commons voted to mandate the metric system throughout the Empire, and in 1897 a parliamentary select committee recommended compulsory metrication within two years. In 1965 the Confederation of British Industry threw its weight behind the cause and the government set up the UK metrication board in 1969, four years before the UK joined the European Common Market.  Joining the community meant signing up to directives on standardised measurements, although the deadline for implementation was repeatedly pushed back. Since 1995, goods sold in Europe have had to be weighed or measured in metric, but the UK was temporarily allowed to continue using the imperial system.  This opt-out was due to expire in 2009, with only pints of beer, milk and cider and miles and supposed to survive beyond the cut-off. But ahead of the deadline, the European Commission admitted that persuading the British to accept grams over ounces was a lost cause, and shops could continue to label products in both systems.  To supporters of metric measures, it is a source of frustration that what they regard as a more logical mechanism has never achieved predominance.  Robin Paice of the UK Metric Association insists there is nothing intrinsically British about miles and pints and, for that matter, nothing inescapably foreign about kilometres and litres.  ""I don't believe things are hard-wired into the national mentality,"" he says.  ""The government has done very little to explain why it would be to the benefit of the UK to use the world's system. If people are asked to change the habits of a lifetime without explanation they are naturally quite reluctant. It's very much a failure of leadership.""  The UK may have the failure of Napoleon's armies to cross the channel to thank or blame for the resistance of imperial. But it is not the only country to fail to enthusiastically embrace metrication.  Japan's traditional shakkanho system was supposed to have been replaced by metric in 1924, but remained popular. It was forbidden in 1966 but is still used in agriculture.  And of course the US continues to weigh and measure in customary units, a system derived from imperial. According to Moran, the similarities between the two codes has served to reinforce UK Atlanticism.  ""Our residual attachment to imperial weights and measures is really to do with a resilient fact about our geo-political position: we are an island with one eye on America and an ambivalent attitude to the continent,"" he says.  ""In Britain the metric system has been associated with mainland Europe and also, since Napoleon, with European imperialism. The Americans used a set of weights and measures that was a variant on the imperial - and Americans coming over here in the war probably strengthened the sense that we had this in common.""  Switching between imperial and metric, the UK's approach to the issue may mirror the debate about its place in the world. But whichever way you measure it, the Channel isn't getting any larger or smaller."
522,"US Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration, Ellen Sauerbrey, says the refugee leaders in the camps are to blame.  Nepal is home to about 107,000 ethnic Nepalese expelled from Bhutan, which says they are illegal immigrants.  The US has said it will take 60,000 refugees, but says it can take more.  ""There is no question that severe intimidation began in the camps when the US made the offer of resettlement,"" Ms Sauerbrey told the BBC.  She was stopping over in the city of Calcutta on way to Delhi after a tour of Nepal and Bhutan.  Ms Sauerbrey blamed the refugee leaders in the camps in Nepal for the ""intimidation"".  ""For those who have spent 17 years trying to develop a programme to return to Bhutan, the idea that a large number of the refugees will come to the US reduces their political power,"" she said.  ""The refugees have also been fed on false rumours consistently.""  Leaders of these Bhutanese refugees have been trying to organise them for a long march back home through India.  But Delhi - which has very friendly relations with Thimphu - has deployed border guards and police to foil these marches.  Ms Sauerbrey says the government of Nepal must provide ""adequate security"" in the refugee camps, so that the UNHCR can provide resettlement information to the refugees and enlist those who voluntarily come forward to accept the offer.  ""If there's enough security in the camps, I am confident most of these refugees would take up the offer of resettlement in the US,"" Ms Sauerbrey said.  She said the US was interested in resettling 60,000 of the refugees over five years, but there was no limit and no quota to the US offer.  ""If more than 60,000 people are interested in being resettled and are referred to our programme by UNHCR, we will take those who qualify.  ""Most will qualify unless someone has a record of violence in the camp,"" she said.  ""We do not take these people because they are highly skilled or educated, we will take them for humanitarian considerations.""  Ms Sauerbrey, who visited Kathmandu and the refugee camps in eastern Nepal before travelling to Bhutan, said the process was formally launched after Nepalese officials went to the camps with her delegation and announced publicly the Nepalese government's support of the resettlement programmes.  She said 3,000 refugees have already applied informally for resettlement in the US.  ""Our goal this year is to interview about 15,000 and, in the next few years, we are expecting 20,000 to 25,000 per year, based on the interest generated amongst the refugees ,"" she added.  Ms Sauerbrey said the US government was keen to resolve the protracted refugee situation on humanitarian grounds.  ""If you have been to refugee camps, they are not nice places and these people have been in the camps for 17 years. That is a long, long time,"" she said.  Ms Sauerbrey said the resettlement could resolve a major part of the problem but there were people in the camps who were genuinely Bhutanese citizens and would very much like to come home.  ""The US and many other international communities do believe that Bhutan has a moral obligation with people who are genuinely Bhutanese citizens, to let them come home,"" she said.  Tens of thousand of Bhutanese of Nepali origin started fleeing the kingdom in the 1990s, complaining of persecution by the royal administration.  They found refuge in the camps in eastern Nepal, run by the UNHCR.  Several rounds of talks between Nepal and Bhutan have failed to resolve the issue.  But as Bhutan heads for its first national elections next year, the refugee leaders are pressing for the return of their people to the kingdom so that they can vote and regain their citizenship ."
523,"O'Sullivan left himself too much to do after he lost eight frames in a row to go into the final session 16-8 down.  ""I missed too many balls, didn't make enough breaks, my safety was poor and my long-ball potting was awful,"" said the 30-year-old.  ""But that's not taking anything from Graeme - he beat me comfortably.""  The two-time champion raised hopes of a comeback when he won three successive frames to reduce the deficit.  But in the 28th frame Dott held his nerve after a tense and mistake-ridden 27 minutes to win it on the black.  ""At 16-8 I thought that was it all over, but when he came out and started missing ball after ball then I thought I had a chance.  ""If I could have found a gear then you never know. To be honest, if Graeme had played as well as he had done in the other sessions then maybe I would have won just one frame.  ""I wish I could explain why I didn't play well. I suppose we're just human beings.""  O'Sullivan explained the problem he had been having with his tips that led to the Essex star pulling one off his cue during the 14th frame.  ""I had about seven in the week coming into the tournament and about eight on this week - I just couldn't find the right one.""  The two-times world champion also revealed why he gave away his cue at the end of the match to a member of the Crucible crowd.  ""I gave it to the young lad because I'll be playing with a new one next season."""
524,"Plc chairman Richard Murray made the announcement to supporters before the 2-0 defeat to Blackburn at The Valley.  The 48-year-old was interviewed by the Football Association recently as they searched for a new England coach.  But Curbishley said: ""This has nothing to do with that. It's a time of mixed emotions, but it is the right time for me and right for the club.""  He added: ""I have had 15 fantastic years, but I wasn't going to extend my contract after my last year. Richard wanted people committed to the club and felt one year wasn't enough commitment.  ""We sorted it out on Friday night and both myself and Richard are happy with it. I have done 15 years and wanted a break. I want to freshen up and not do anything for a little while.  ""It is all about me and Charlton. I want the best for them and this is the right decision.""  Curbishley - who was appointed joint manager with Steve Gritt in 1991 and took over in sole charge in 1995 - had a year left on his current contract.  Murray told Charlton fans before the game: ""I sat down with Alan on Friday to discuss our plans for the future, and Alan was as honest as he has always been throughout his time at Charlton and told me he would not be extending his current contract.  ""We enjoy a fantastic relationship and Alan only wants to do his best for Charlton, for whom he has a deep affection.  ""We both agreed that it would therefore be in the interests of the club and Alan if we parted company at the end of the current season.""  Curbishley was close to tears as he also spoke to fans at the end of the game.  Murray added: ""Fifteen years ago we started on a journey which saw us return here to The Valley in 1992 and then embark on a period of sustained progress and success on and off the field.  ""Throughout the entire period Alan Curbishley has been the manager of this great club.  ""He has given us memories that will live with us all forever.  ""Promotion to the Premiership in 1998 followed the most dramatic play-off final ever to take place at Wembley Stadium - 4-4 against Sunderland and 7-6 winners on penalties.  ""In 2000 we won the First Division Championship in spectacular style.  ""Next season we will start our seventh successive season in the Premiership - the best league in the world. Alan has masterminded all this success and deserves our total admiration."""
525,"Scientists have found further evidence that dolphins call each other by ""name"".  Research has revealed that the marine mammals use a unique whistle to identify each other.  A team from the University of St Andrews in Scotland found that when the animals hear their own call played back to them, they respond.  The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Dr Vincent Janik, from the university's Sea Mammal Research Unit, said: ""(Dolphins) live in this three-dimensional environment, offshore without any kind of landmarks and they need to stay together as a group.  ""These animals live in an environment where they need a very efficient system to stay in touch.""  It had been-long suspected that dolphins use distinctive whistles in much the same way that humans use names.  Previous research found that these calls were used frequently, and dolphins in the same groups were able to learn and copy the unusual sounds.  But this is the first time that the animals response to being addressed by their ""name"" has been studied.  To investigate, researchers recorded a group of wild bottlenose dolphins, capturing each animal's signature sound.  They then played these calls back using underwater speakers.  ""We played signature whistles of animals in the group, we also played other whistles in their repertoire and then signature whistles of different populations - animals they had never seen in their lives,"" explained Dr Janik.  The researchers found that individuals only responded to their own calls, by sounding their whistle back.  The team believes the dolphins are acting like humans: when they hear their name, they answer.  Dr Janik said this skill probably came about to help the animals to stick together in a group in their vast underwater habitat.  He said: ""Most of the time they can't see each other, they can't use smell underwater, which is a very important sense in mammals for recognition, and they also don't tend to hang out in one spot, so they don't have nests or burrows that they return to.""  The researchers believe this is the first time this has been seen in an animal, although other studies have suggested some species of parrot may use sounds to label others in their group.  Dr Janik said that understanding how this skill evolved in parallel in very different groups of animals could tell us more about how communication developed in humans."
526,"Has the explosion of media in India been a mixed blessing?  With more than 70,000 newspapers and over 500 satellite channels in several languages, Indians are seemingly spoilt for choice and diversity.  India is already the biggest newspaper market in the world - over 100 million copies sold each day. Advertising revenues have soared. In the past two decades, the number of channels has grown from one - the dowdy state-owned broadcaster Doordarshan - to more than 500, of which more than 80 are news channels.  But such robust growth, many believe, may have come at the cost of accuracy, journalistic ethics and probity.  The media has taken some flak in recent months for being shallow, inaccurate and sometimes damagingly obtrusive. Former Supreme Court judge and chairman of the country's Press Council, Markandey Katju, fired the first broadside, exhorting journalists to educate themselves more. Predictably, it provoked a sharp reaction from the media.  Economist Amartya Sen is the latest to join the list of critics after being wrongly quoted in the mainstream media a couple of times recently. There are at least two huge barriers, writes Dr Sen in a recent article, to the quality of Indian media.  One is about professional laxity which leads to inaccuracies and mistakes. The other, he says, is a class bias in the choice of what news to cover and what to ignore.  Dr Sen offers unexceptional solutions to ensure accuracy - newspapers should publish corrections (a few like The Hindu and Mint already do) and journalists should be given more training. He suggests that reporters should make use of recorders during interviews rather than take rushed notes for accuracy - in fact, many reporters do use recorders and even when they don't, they usually do take correct notes. But stories can sometimes get mangled on their way to publication, resulting in inaccurate headlines.  Dr Sen's worry about lack of training is more pertinent. Most Indian newsrooms have no legacy - or practice - of editorial training. They still host energetic, sharp and argumentative journalists. But analysts say many newsrooms do lack rigour and there is a crying need for some serious, consistent training in fact checking and reporting ethics.  Dr Sen's other grouse about the class bias in Indian newsrooms is valid but again unexceptional. Class bias in newsrooms, say media pundits, is prevalent in big media all over the world. But class bias in reporting on a country where more than a third of its people live in abject poverty has more serious implications. Journalists can easily become uncritical cheerleaders for a high growth, low equity society.  Does this also have to do with low minority participation in newsrooms?  A 2006 study by the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies found that of the 315 key decision-makers surveyed from 37 Hindi and English publication and TV channels, almost 90% of decision makers in the English language print media and 79% in television were from the upper castes. There is virtually no representation of Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who comprise some 20% of India's population and live on the margins. This accounts for a serious lack of diversity in Indian media.  Indian media houses can look to US newsrooms for inspiration. In 1975, fewer than 4% of journalists in newsrooms were from black and other minorities. Three years later, the editors pledged that minorities must get proportionate representation in all newspapers. They offered scholarships and organised job fairs. By 2000, more than 60% of the nearly 1,500 American newspapers had abided by the pledge. It was a major triumph for news diversity. Cannot Indian papers do something similar?  Dr Sen actually misses the bigger crises in Indian media.  There are serious concerns about trivialisation of content and the increasing concentration of media ownership in the hands of large corporate groups. There is now the culture of non-stop breaking news and, some fear, the transformation of news into a commodity.  Most seriously, there is the scourge of what is called paid news, which involves influential people - mainly politicians - paying newspapers and news channels for positive coverage. It became widespread in the run-up to the 2009 elections.  A 71-page Press Council investigation named leading newspapers that had received money for publishing information disguised as news in favour of individuals, including senior politicians. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an independent journalist who was one of the investigators, says a lobby of big publishers pushed the Press Council to water down the report. Even Vice President Hamid Ansari regretted the development, saying that the Press Council's inability to come out with the report was ""a pointer to the problems of self-regulation and the culture of silence in the entire industry when it comes to self-criticism"".  How do you stop this? Journalists like Mr Guha Thakurta argue for increased transparency, self-regulation and competition regulation."
527,"In the UK, where GM trades as Vauxhall, the new Astra will be manufactured in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, from 2010.  The move safeguards the survival of the site, which has long been threatened with closure. The loser is Belgium, which also used to make the Astra.  US group General Motors has been struggling against mounting losses and rising competition from Asian firms.  The Astra is GM's best-selling car in Europe, selling almost half a million vehicles last year. On the continent, the cars are sold under the Opel brand.  GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster made the announcement following talks with worker representatives in Belgium.  A total of 3bn euros (£2bn) will be invested in the Astra project across Europe, while the UK operations are also expected to get a government grant.  The decision to base Astra production at the UK site will lead to the equivalent of an entire production shift - corresponding to about 1,400 jobs - being abolished at the company's factory in Antwerp.  By contrast, it will lead to a shift being reinstated at the group's site in Merseyside - a move that was warmly welcomed by the government and union leaders.  Other sites that will be working on the new ""compact"" car model will be Bochum in Germany, Gliwice in Poland and Sweden's Trollhattan factory.  GM Europe has cut about 12,000 jobs since 2005 as part of efforts to make regional operations profitable again.  The operation only returned to the black last year for the first time since 1999, making a profit of $227m (£116m).  Parent company GM itself has closed 12 plants in North America and cut more than 34,000 jobs in a bid to cut $9bn from operating costs after unveiling a $10.6bn net loss for 2005.  Wirral South MP Ben Chapman, who has nearly 300 constituents employed at the Ellesmere Port plant, said it was ""great news for the local and regional economy"".  ""And of course I am delighted for my constituents and their families whose livelihood comes from working at Vauxhall,"" he added.  ""Contrary to much apparent doom and gloom elsewhere in the industry, this secures a bright future for car manufacturing in Merseyside and Cheshire."""
528,"New runways at Heathrow and Gatwick are among the options that have been short-listed by the Airports Commission for expanding UK airport capacity.  The three short-listed options include adding a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow, and a new runway at Gatwick.  The commission, led by businessman Sir Howard Davies, will also consider a new airport in the Isle of Grain in north Kent.  The commission has not shortlisted proposals for expanding Stansted or Birmingham, but said there was likely to be a case for considering them as ""potential options"" for any second new runway by 2050.  Sir Howard was asked in 2012 to investigate the options for expanding the UK's aviation capacity and try to come up with a plan.  He said the Commission's analysis showed one net additional runway was needed by 2030.  ""The capacity challenge is not yet critical, but it will become so if no action is taken soon,"" he added.  There are four interesting elements of today's report. It hasn't written off the ambitious, expensive idea of building a new mega-airport on the other side of London in the Thames Estuary. It misses off Stansted, despite it being picked for expansion by the last government. Stansted lost a lot of passengers in the recession. It also suggests that we might not need one huge hub airport after all, because all the growth in recent years has come from low-cost carriers. In a nutshell, it makes the case stronger for a bigger Gatwick. When I first took over the transport job, about two years ago, the government told me straight away that it would not expand Heathrow. One of the first things the coalition did when it came to power was to cancel Labour plans for a third runway at the airport. I've gone through my old notebooks and found this phrase written down, ""dead and buried"". But after a great deal of lobbying from the airport's owners, other business leaders, airlines and the unions, as well as support from the Transport Select Committee, Heathrow is emerging once again, as a front-runner in the fight to get a new runway. Sir Howard has set a deadline of 2030. But believe me, there are plenty in the industry - like Willie Walsh at British Airways, for example - who still don't think that in the end, anything will actually ever get built.  The Commission has short-listed the following proposals to investigate ahead of its final report:  The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has said that putting a new runway at Heathrow would be a ""catastrophe"".  Following the commission's report, Mr Johnson said he continued to support the creation of the Isle of Grain airport in north Kent.  ""A new airport in the inner estuary is the only credible hub option left. By keeping it on the table, Davies is saying you have a choice - between a damaging U-turn or a radical new vision for expansion,"" he said.  In its report, the Commission calculates an Isle of Grain airport would cost up to £112bn - around five times that of its three short-listed options.  However, it said it would look at it in the first half of 2014, to reach a view on whether the option offered ""a credible proposal"".  ""The overall balance of economic impacts would be uncertain - particularly as an Estuary airport would require the closure of Heathrow for commercial reasons and London City for airspace reasons,"" it says.  Meanwhile, supporters of Heathrow's expansion say it will be quicker and cheaper than other options and will help to maintain the UK as an international aviation hub.  Heathrow's owners submitted evidence to the commission arguing that a new runway could be in place by 2029, allowing 260,000 more flights.  Colin Matthews, Heathrow chief executive, told the BBC: ""The case for Heathrow is strong. It's important that businesses can get around the globe to where economies are growing.  ""We've got Paris and Amsterdam, Frankfurt desperately trying to eat our lunch, they want to have the business that the UK benefits from today.""  John Cridland, head of business lobby group the CBI, said that urgent action was needed from the government when the commission's final recommendations were made in 2015.  ""It is no longer acceptable to bury our heads in the sand on this,"" he added.  Heathrow is one of the world's busiest hub airports, handling 70 million passengers in 2012.  But the airport operates at 98% of its capacity.  When the coalition government came to power in 2010, it scrapped the former Labour government's plan for a third runway at Heathrow.  The government said on Monday that it had not ruled out any options when it came to airport expansion in the south-east of England.  On Sunday, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said that the government would stick to its pledge not to build a new runway at Heathrow before 2015.  He told the BBC: ""We will not be building a third runway in this Parliament. We will stick by our manifesto commitment."""
529,"The Scottish government has published its draft bill on a second independence referendum.  The move does not mean another referendum will definitely be held.  But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland should be ready to hold a vote before the UK leaves the EU if it is felt necessary to protect Scottish interests.  UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said she does not believe there is a mandate for another referendum on independence.  If Scottish Ministers decide a referendum is necessary it would then be for the Scottish Parliament - where the SNP and Scottish Greens form a small pro-independence majority - to consider the bill and decide whether a vote should be held.  The UK government would then be asked to grant a Section 30 order to make the referendum legally binding.  The draft Referendum Bill was formally published by Constitution Secretary Derek Mackay, despite the Scottish Parliament being in recess until next week.  It says that any future referendum would be held on a similar basis to the one in 2014, which saw voters reject independence by 55% to 45%.  The draft bill also says that:  The proposals have now gone out for a public consultation, which will run until 11 January next year.  But pro-union opposition parties have already argued that there is no appetite in Scotland for another ""divisive"" referendum, and have pledged to fight it ""every step of the way"".  And a spokesman for the prime minister also dismissed the need for another independence vote, saying: ""The prime minister and the government does not believe that there is a mandate for one.  ""There was one only two years ago. There was an extremely high turnout and there was a resounding result in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK.""  Asked if UK ministers would reject a call for a second referendum from the Scottish government, he stated: ""There has not been a call.""  Scotland voted by 62% to 38% to remain in the EU in June's referendum, but the UK as a whole voted to leave - with Ms Sturgeon immediately instructing Scottish government officials to start drawing up plans for a fresh vote on independence.  However, opinion polls have suggested there has not been a major upsurge in support for independence since the Brexit vote, with a narrow majority still in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK.  Some senior SNP figures have cautioned Ms Sturgeon against ""rushing into"" another independence referendum before she could be certain of winning it.  In her foreward to the consultation document, Ms Sturgeon said the Brexit vote meant ""Scotland is now faced with one of the specific scenarios in which this government pledged that the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold an independence referendum"".  She added: ""This government remains willing to work with the UK government to negotiate a future relationship with Europe that is in line with the views of the overwhelming majority of the Scottish people and which works for the United Kingdom as a whole.  ""We will put forward constructive proposals that will both protect Scotland's interests and give an opportunity for the UK government to demonstrate that Scotland is indeed an equal partner.  ""But if it becomes clear that it is only through independence that Scotland's interests can be protected, then the people of Scotland must have the ability to reconsider that question, and to do so before the UK leaves the EU.""  Ms Sturgeon, who is expected to meet UK Prime Minister Theresa May in London on Monday, has said efforts to protect Scotland's place in Europe would intensify over the coming weeks.  She has said she will put forward specific proposals aimed at keeping Scotland in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves.  And she will push for ""substantial additional powers"" for Holyrood as part of the UK's Article 50 negotiations, including over international deals with other nations and immigration.  Mrs May has said that all parts of the UK will leave the EU at the same time despite calls from the SNP for a separate arrangement to be agreed for Scotland.  But she has said she is ""willing to listen to options"" on Scotland's future relationship with the EU.  Responding to the draft bill's publication, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the Scottish government had ""given up on being a government for all of Scotland and is just playing to the SNP choir"".  She added: ""The majority of folk don't want another vote, the majority of people in Scotland don't want independence, and the SNP should take this off the table.  ""I don't think any of the questions that Brexit raises are answered by ripping Scotland out of our own union of nations - it is worth four times more in terms of trade.  ""And I don't accept, when Nicola Sturgeon tells someone like me who voted to Remain, that my vote for Remain is somehow a proxy for independence.""  Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale described the publication of the draft bill as ""irresponsible economic vandalism"".  She added: ""Instead of seeking fresh divisions, the SNP should be prioritising our public services such as education and healthcare.  ""This is a referendum that Scotland does not need or want. Nicola Sturgeon should keep the promise she made that the 2014 referendum was a once-in-a-generation vote.""  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""It is now crystal clear that the SNP's priority is not education. It is not health, or even working to protect the benefits of our EU membership. It is independence.""  But Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie said it would be ""foolish"" for the UK government to block a second referendum.  He added: ""The Westminster government's inability to acknowledge the overwhelming mandate for Remain in Scotland, or demonstrate any kind of flexibility the union could take in the individual UK nations' forging relations with Europe, shows that independence is quickly becoming the most realistic option for Scotland to shape its own partnership with the European Union."""
530,"This emerged as he was cross-questioned during his trial for rape. He denies rape but admits to consensual sex, and said he was ready to marry his accuser.  Remarks about HIV made by Mr Zuma in court earlier this week have angered Aids educators.  More than 5m South Africans have HIV - the highest number in the world.  Mr Zuma - previously seen as a possible future president - retains considerable popularity. His supporters see the charge as a political conspiracy.  Mr Zuma said in court on Wednesday he had left his bedroom after having sex with the woman and taken a shower because this ""would minimise the risk of contracting the disease [HIV]"".  He also said that he was prepared to marry the woman who accused him of rape, and that her aunts were discussing the possibility of marriage and a bride price as Zulu tradition dictates.  ""Yes, if we had reached an agreement with that, I would have had my cows ready,"" Mr Zuma told the court, referring to ""lobola"": the traditional donation of animals by a husband to his bride's family.  Mr Zuma was being cross-examined by prosecutor Charin de Beer, after testifying in his defence on Monday and Tuesday.  Mr Zuma's testimony that he did not use a condom during the encounter, despite knowing the woman was HIV-positive, caused dismay among local Aids activists.  Mr Zuma said he normally uses condoms, but did not have one available on the night of the alleged rape.  Having unprotected sex is thought to be the main way in which Aids is spread in Africa.  Mr Zuma, 63, insisted that the woman, 31, who may not be named, had initiated the sexual encounter.  Last week, the defence failed in an application to have the rape charge dropped.  The case has attracted huge publicity and court sessions have drawn demonstrations by groups both for and against Mr Zuma.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations of rape and corruption are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  A separate corruption trial is scheduled to begin in the Durban High Court in July. Mr Zuma denies the corruption charge."
531,"The couple said the split was ""amicable"", while an ITV statement added that ex-EastEnders star Jack would continue to see Kym's children.  The pair married in 2002, having met in a BBC canteen when Kym was appearing on TV music programme Top of the Pops.  They had a trial separation a year later but reunited. Nobody else was involved in the break-up, they said.  Kym was 25 and Jack was 20 when their wedding took place in front of 300 guests.  OK! magazine was reported to have paid £300,000 for exclusive coverage of the ceremony six years ago.  After the wedding, Kym quit Hear'Say - the band brought together by ITV reality show Popstars in 2001 - while Jack left EastEnders, in which he had played Jamie Mitchell for four years.  Since joining Coronation Street, Kym has won a National Television Award, a British Soap Award and a TV Quick Award for her role as barmaid Michelle Connor.  Last year Kym admitted in an interview that she and Jack were ""not the perfect couple"" but were ""just happy being us"".  ""Our relationship is good because we work at it, and we're friends as well as being in love.  ""Jack and I have our own lives outside the family so we can come home and talk about something else. It's healthy for a relationship.""  The ITV statement, issued on Thursday night, said: ""With great sadness, Kym and Jack Ryder have decided to separate after seven years together.  ""Their separation is amicable and they remain friends, with Jack continuing to see Kym's children, David and Emily.""  The pair also requested privacy ""in consideration of the children's emotional welfare""."
532,"   The BSC considered 8 points of complaint from Mr Hancock and 2 from Mr Bauval. Only 1 of Mr Hancock's 8 points was upheld, together with a point of Mr Bauval's which concerned the same issue.         The Commission concluded that ""the programme makers acted in good faith in their examination of the theories of Mr Hancock and Mr Bauval"".     Mr Hancock complained that he had been treated unjustly or unfairly in that: The programme gave an unfair account of his case for a significant correlation between the Great Sphinx and the constellation Leo.    : The Commission finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in these matters.     The programme gave an unfair account of his case for a significant correlation between the Angkor temples in Cambodia and the constellation Draco.   : The Commission finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock on this point.     The programme unfairly omitted arguments in support of his belief that the Great Sphinx was much older than generally accepted, and wrongly implied that he had originated this theory.   : The Commission finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock on this point.     The programme unfairly excluded the views of a supporter of Mr Hancock's belief that Yonaguni, an underwater formation off Japan, was man-made.   : The Commission finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in this regard.     The programme wrongly credited him with originating the theory that Atlantis was Antarctica.   : The Commission finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in this regard.     The programme did not fairly represent his views on carbon-dating.   : The Commission finds that the programme’s treatment of this aspect did not result in any significant unfairness to Mr Hancock.      The programme had created the impression that he was an intellectual fraudster who had put forward half baked theories and ideas in bad faith, and that he was incompetent to defend his own arguments.   : [The Commission] finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in these matters. Mr Hancock and Mr Bauval both complained that they had been treated unjustly or unfairly in that:    The programme unfairly omitted one of their arguments in rebuttal of a speaker who criticised the theory of a significant correlation between the Giza pyramids and the belt stars of the constellation Orion (the ""correlation theory"").   : [The Commission] finds that this was unfair to Mr Hancock and to Mr Bauval. Mr Bauval complained that he had been treated unjustly or unfairly in that:   The programme had not allowed him an opportunity to respond to a further point of criticism of the correlation theory.   : The Commission finds no unfairness to Mr Bauval on this point.     The programme had created a ""strong implication"" that his theory was a ""con"".   : [The Commission] finds no unfairness to Mr Bauval in these matters.        "
533,"The cleric was jailed for seven years in February 2006 for soliciting to murder and inciting racial hatred.  A judge at the Old Bailey said Abu Hamza might not be able to pay, but the decision would allow the Legal Services Commission to seize his assets.  He accused the London-based cleric of lying about his financial interests.  Lord Justice Hughes made the order for the recovery of the full costs of the defence.  This will allow the Legal Services Commission to apply to seize a £220,000 house in Greenford, west London, which Abu Hamza had claimed belonged to his sister.  The judge, however, said he did not believe him.  Abu Hamza told the Old Bailey, via video link from prison, that since his disability benefits had been stopped in 2003, he had no assets and no access to money.  He said he had been living off handouts from family and friends.  But the court heard that Abu Hamza, whose wife and six children live in a council house, was still contributing to private school fees of £9,000 a year.  An investigation was carried out by the Legal Services Commission last February after Abu Hamza was ordered to disclose his financial circumstances.  The judge said that his failure to declare his interest in the Greenford property back then demonstrated that ""the story I have been told today is simply not true"".  The court was told that Abu Hamza's defence solicitors were seeking to recover costs of just over £1m but the judge warned that sum could rise.  ""We must ensure that legal aid is spent on the most vulnerable people in society and those who can afford to pay, do so,"" he said.  Abu Hamza, a former preacher at Finsbury Park Mosque, in London, was convicted of 11 of the 15 charges he faced.  During a later appeal that failed, lawyers argued his case had been prejudiced by ""unique"" world events and a media hate-campaign."
534,"The powerful bomb explosion outside the US consulate in Karachi comes at an awkward time for Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.  The latest incident, which claimed at least eight lives, came only a day after the visit to Pakistan by US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld.  Mr Rumsfeld was in the region not only to persuade both India and Pakistan to defuse tensions, but also to discuss General Musharraf's military operations against al-Qaeda and other religious militants.  The US envoy expressed his satisfaction at the level of cooperation provided by the Pakistani authorities in hunting down al-Qaeda militants in the country.  But the Karachi bomb will pile further pressure on President Musharraf to bring Islamic militancy under control.  President Musharraf has expressed his determination to deal with militants on several occasions.  But he is also aware of the intense pressure from the country's conservative Islamic lobby, which accuses him of succumbing to Western pressures at the cost of the country's religious ideology.  Observers say he faces a delicate balancing act between taking action against Islamic militants and ensuring that he is not seen as someone who has no regard for local sensitivities.  Whatever he does, the involvement of al-Qaeda and its Pakistani supporters is becoming a major problem for President Musharraf's administration.  Many believe the country is now paying the price for supporting the US-backed war against terrorism in Afghanistan.  This is now the fourth time this year that foreign nationals have specifically been targeted in Pakistan.  A little known outfit calling itself the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, said it kidnapped US journalist Daniel Pearl in Karachi in January.  But that was an exception.  It is still unclear who was behind a grenade attack in March on a church in Islamabad attended mostly by foreign diplomats.  Whether it is religious sectarianism, communal violence, or attacks aimed at foreigners, the masterminds rarely identify themselves.  Yet more worrying for authorities is the emergence of suicide bombing as a favoured tactic.  Whatever the government says about cracking down on militancy in Pakistan, those responsible for the mayhem are proving elusive."

This is the story of Karan Shergill who is very confused about the directions he needs to take in life. Coming from a well off family, he never gave it a thought on what he wants to be, when he grows up. So he just ends up in the Indian Army with n o The only person he can rely on is Romila Dutta (Priety Zinta), a bright ambitious young woman who is capable of standing on her own two feet. She loves Karan since childhood and believes that one day he will find himself. As days go by, Karan finds it difficult to cope with the gruelling army life. Unable to take it any longer, Karan resigns from the academy. But his home coming is strongly dissapproved by his father and Romila. This also creates bad feelings between Karan and his girlfriend. So they go their separate ways. Some time later, Karan and Romila meet again, under different circumstances. India and Pakistan are at war. Romila is now a war correspondant for a television channel. Based in Kashmir, she comes across Karan who by now has graduated as an army officer. An officer with one aim and that is to fight for his country tooth and nail. . . . Young Farhan Akhtar, proves yet again that he is one of the finiest directors Bollywood has to date. He has paid full attention to the script and the technical aspects, giving rise to a polished product similar to his debut film, Dil Chahta Hai. Farhan did good in hiring German Christopher Popp who has captured the cinematography of Ladakh beautifully. The action scenes are worth mentioning. Unlike other mediocre Bollywood films, the war scenes appear realistic. The sequence when Lt. Shergill and his fellow soldiers climb the cliff to surprise the intruders at the top of the mountainous Kargil region, is well executed by the director. Background score by the music directors, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy add further inpact to the film especially towards the climax. Hrithik Roshan has already proved in Koi Mil Gaya that he is a versatile actor. He has shown that he can play different characters. In Lakshya he sports a different hairstyle which adds dept to the happy go lucky character of Karan Shergill. It's so refreshing to see how he transforms from a carefree youth to a matured soldier full of determination and courage. Priety Zinta looks good throughout and holds her own thorughout the film. Other casts including Amitabh Bachchan, Om Puri, Amrish Puri Sharad Kapoor, Boman Irani and Sushant Singh, make full contribution to the storyline. On the whole, Lakshya is a well crafted film different from other Bollywood masalas currently being released. Well worth watching! No doubt it will do tremendous business in the UK with a high entry in the UK top ten charts."
536,"Former Cape Verde President Pedro Verona Pires has been awarded this year's $5m (£3.2m) Mo Ibrahim prize for good governance in Africa.  The prize committee said Mr Pires, who stepped down in August, had helped make the archipelago off the West African coast a ""model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity"".  The prize is supposed to be awarded each year to a democratically elected leader who has voluntarily left office.  There has been no winner for two years.  The committee said there had been no suitable candidate.  The $5m award, given over 10 years followed by $200,000 a year for life, is the world's most valuable individual prize.  The previous winners are Botswana's President Festus Mogae and Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano.  Sudan-born telecoms entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim says the prize is needed because many leaders of sub-Saharan African countries come from poor backgrounds and are tempted to hang on to power for fear that poverty awaits them when they leave office.  Mr Pires, 77, told the BBC he was at the gym when he heard that he had won the prize.  ""I want to invest the money to publish a book about the story and the struggle for the independence of Cape Verde,"" he said.  ""I have no thought of using the money to invest in business or anything like that.""  Mr Pires played a key role in the fight against Portuguese colonial rule and became prime minister at independence in 1975 - a position he held until 1991.  He led moves to introduce multi-party elections, which his PAICV party lost.  Ten years later, he bounced back to become president and stepped down after two terms, rejecting calls to change the constitution to remain in office, like several African leaders have done.  Despite winning the prize, Mr Pires said he had no advice for other leaders on the continent.  ""I don't like to give lessons. I think each leader has his own challenges,"" he said.  ""We have to believe in African people and allow them to decide their own fate.""  Committee head Salim Ahmed Salim praised his ""humility"" and ""personal integrity"" in refusing calls to change the constitution.  Cape Verde - an Atlantic archipelago of 10 islands - has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, partly because of a boom in tourism.  It is now classed by the United Nations as a middle-income country.  But unemployment and poverty are still high, forcing many people to emigrate.  Some 700,000 Cape Verdeans live abroad, more than the 500,000 at home, official statistics show."
537,"Scott Sinclair insists he will continue to take Swansea City's penalties despite missing his first for the club against Manchester City.  England goalkeeper Joe Hart denied Sinclair's spot-kick in Sunday's clash, which the Swans eventually won 1-0.  Sinclair had scored all 13 previous penalties since his arrival at the Liberty Stadium in August 2010.  ""I won't be shirking my responsibility. If we get another penalty then I'll be ready to take one,"" he said.  Hart, who tried to rattle Sinclair's focus before the penalty with some 'sledging', pulled off a fine one-handed save after six minutes to end the winger's successful run.  Sinclair, who scored two penalties in last season's Championship play-off win against Reading at Wembley, admits the attention given to his penalty technique and record makes it tougher to beat keepers from 12 yards out.  ""He [Hart] was saying 'don't wait for me' before I took the penalty,"" revealed Sinclair.  ""That didn't put me off at all, but he did well to save it.  ""There's no doubt it's getting harder for me to score penalties because goalkeepers are doing their homework and studying videos.  ""That's the challenge for me - to keep them guessing.""  Despite being denied by his former England Under-21 team-mate, Sinclair will still be first in line to take a penalty should the Swans be awarded one at Fulham this weekend.  The 22-year-old, with seven goals to his name in the top flight this season, added: ""There's always pressure on taking a penalty because you're expected to score.  ""I'm not one to shy away from it - I've no problem in taking the next one.  ""I've got the mental strength to remain positive.  ""The gaffer [Brendan Rodgers] told me at half-time how important my penalties have been [for Swansea] - I've scored 13 from 14, so it's not that bad a record."""
538,"        I'm here with Colin Sell, famously the pianist on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Does it seem like 30 years? Were you there from the very beginning?      It sort of takes me by surprise actually that, yes, it's been going for 30 years. I joined it, I think, 28 years ago. I didn't do the pilot and I didn't do the first series and then I joined it. And the reason I joined it was because the very young producer, the very good producer who'd been asked to take it over was a chap called Simon Brett who of course has gone on to do lots of other things, writing books and plays and heaven knows what else. Bur he'd seen me do stuff up at the Edinburgh Fringe and he just took a complete chance on me and said ""I've been given this new program to do and I've heard you play and heard you write music and you improvise and you can kind of cope with most things that people throw at you musically and would you like to do it?"" So, that was back in 1974, I was in short-trousers of course then, I was a child prodigy really, and it took me a long time to get used to it because I was working, and I still am working, with people who are sort of my icons, really. You know, I was a teenager watching The Goodies and there was Barry Cryer and Humph Lyttelton playing jazz and all that, you know. And Willie Rushton who was an enormous name, particularly in the 60s. He made his name really doing That Was The Week That Was and so on. And suddenly, I was working with these people and so for about 10 years I kept thinking ""They're never going to ask me back"". Gradually over a period of time I've become, which is very nice for me, part of the set up. I don't do much on the programme, it has to be said if you actually analyse it, I don't do a great deal but I get a kind of reflected glory from it.     And there's a certain relationship on stage, at least, between you and Humph which people enjoy.      Yes, yes. They do. And actually, because we get on very well, it's good fun to play that sort of antagonist towards me. I just sit there and smile blithely at him and I don't have a microphone in front of me so if I want to make any comments, I have to really shout so we get this disembodied voice in the background which Humph always likes to play off and makes rude remarks about me.     So have you ever got together with Humph as pianist and trumpeter?      Only on a couple of occasions when we've done Christmas shows - he's had his trumpet there and we've done Christmas specials and he's played 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer', and we've worked then with his bass player and drummer as well. And there was a book launch we did some time ago, two or three years back, at Pizza Express and we had a quartet then. There was Humph and me and then his bass player and drummer. We did quite a lot of jazz playing which was very jolly. But no, we don't - apart from these odd occasions, we don't work together musically. The only thing is that many years ago I was asked to do the music for a radio version of 'Look Back in Anger' and Jimmy Porter, the character who plays the trumpet, so somebody said to me 'Well, why don't you get Humph Lyttelton to come and play it' which was a very good idea. It was kind of revenge for all the times that Humph Lyttelton had been rude to me in the program. We had a good laugh about it. I was actually getting him to come into the studio and play my music and do what I told him. Actually, it was smashing. We had a wonderful time. It was great. He did a very good version of what the sort of trumpet playing that Jimmy Porter would have done.     There's a huge love for the show across the country and Humph recently played trumpet on a Radiohead…      He did.     More...     "
539,"Ron Dennis has staged an internal coup and wrestled back control of the McLaren Formula 1 team.  The 66-year-old Englishman, who stood down as team principal in 2009 and had been at loggerheads with the McLaren board, has been appointed chief executive officer.  He replaces Martin Whitmarsh, whose role as team principal is under threat.  The identity of the team principal will be announced next month, but no-one has yet been sacked or made redundant.  Dennis has been in dispute with Whitmarsh over the past two years and has tried to remove his former protege from his position on several occasions, but failed because of his fractured relationship with the other board members.  It is not clear how that relationship has been repaired.  Dennis told McLaren staff on Thursday that ""there will be change"" and ""we will win again"".  In December, he said he had spoken about the future with former Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn, who will be considered a front-runner to be McLaren's new team principal once he has finished a planned six-month sabbatical.  A senior McLaren insider told BBC Sport that Dennis, who has been dissatisfied with the performance of the F1 team for some time, did not want to return to a role on the pit wall at races.  McLaren had their worst season for three decades in 2013, failing to secure a podium finish for the first time since 1980.  The team have not won a drivers' title since Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and have failed to win the constructors' title since 1998.  In a statement, Dennis said the company's shareholders had ""mandated me to write an exciting new chapter in the story of McLaren, beginning by improving our on-track and off-track performance"".  He added: ""Over the coming weeks, I intend to undertake a thorough and objective review of each of our businesses with the intention of optimising every aspect of our existing operations, while identifying new areas of growth that capitalise on our technologies, and where appropriate further investing in them.  ""During February, I will articulate a new Group strategy and implement the organisational structure best suited to achieving it.""  There has been no change in the company's shareholding. The Bahrain royal family's Mumtalakat investment fund owns 50%, with Dennis owning 25% and his long-time partner Mansour Ojjeh the remaining 25%.  Ojjeh is recovering from a double lung transplant and has temporarily relinquished his role as a director to his brother Aziz.  Whitmarsh had been trying to persuade Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso to join the team in 2015 but the latest development must make that move highly unlikely now.  Dennis and Alonso fell out in dramatic style when the Spaniard drove for McLaren in 2007.  Last month, Dennis told BBC Sport he would not have a problem with the two-time champion returning to the team, but Alonso has made it clear he still blames Dennis for their past problems.  Alonso is under contract to Ferrari until the end of 2016, although his relationship with the Italian team cooled during a troubled 2013 season."

From next month, they'll be able to see one of the wonders of the ancient world, the Pharos Lighthouse, which was discovered four years ago by marine archaeologists.  Antiquities officials say permission to visit other areas will follow, such as the submerged royal quarters where Queen Cleopatra was thought to have had a palace.

541,"Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s.  The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the ""pride of the pipsqueakery"".  The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been ""brutally drab"".  And he accused music paper NME of being out to ""get Morrissey"" in the 1990s.  The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994.  He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and ""steps inside and stays for two years"".  ""For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone,"" he wrote.  He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a ""mewling miniature monster"" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an ""uncluttered commitment"".  Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of ""constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue"" in court.  This is Morrissey's chance to right every perceived wrong in his life - teachers, the NME, judges (50 pages), John Peel... Even The Thompson Twins, who stopped The Smiths' debut album from getting to number one. However, it is a thoroughly entertaining read, with a laugh-out-loud moment every couple of pages. Michael Stipe is criticised for not brushing his teeth before an REM gig. His primary school teacher is described as the sort ""who will never marry and will die smelling of attics"". There are revelations: Love affairs with a man and a woman; a thorough analysis of The Smiths' break-up (Johnny Marr was the ""master"", Morrissey ""the servant""); and enough titbits to delight fans (he was a 100 metres champion, turned down a part in Friends, and is a fan of A-ha). There is also beautiful writing. Manchester of the late '60s is described as ""an old fire, wheezing its last, where we all worry ourselves soulless, forbidden to be romantic"".  The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together.  The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an ""unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths"".  ""The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!"" Morrissey wrote.  Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey.  When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr ""pinned him to the swivel chair"".  Travis, Morrissey drily noted, ""would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan"" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed ""saved his life and made it count in the long run"".  The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and ""allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'"".  In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: ""Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?""  The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was ""Kafka-esque in its nightmare"".  One teacher, he recounted, ""stands and stares and stands and stares"" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over.  ""At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine,"" Morrissey wrote.  The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as ""a last-minute content disagreement""."
542,"In the two years between coming to power and the general election of 1959, Macmillan worked miracles. When he entered Number 10, Labour were 13 points ahead in the opinion polls and by the time election was called the Conservatives enjoyed a seven point lead.  Clement Attlee retired as the leader of the Labour Party in 1955 after Labour's second successive general election defeat. Hugh Gaitskell emerged as the Party's new leader and quickly papered over the party's Bevanite divisions. For the first time in nearly a decade, a Labour victory looked possible.  The economy formed the battleground for the election. Macmillan's record in office was mixed but it was undeniable that the economy had enjoyed an upswing in recent years. Many Britons were able to buy consumer durables such as televisions, washing machines, cars and fridges for the first time. And with the country feeling the effects of a generous budget, Macmillan set the date for the election as 8 October 1959.  Conservatives campaigned with loudspeakers, on the streets...  Labour's manifesto, Britain Belongs to You, offered voters an increase in pensions and the municipalisation of rented housing. Hugh Gaitskell was trumpeted as ""the man with the plan"" and Labour attempted to capitalise on the new medium of television that was transforming the public's perception of politics. More than 70% of British homes were now equipped with TV sets.  Labour hoped to use TV to present Gaitskell as Britain's next prime minister. Broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy described Labour's election broadcasts, masterminded by Tony Benn, as ""smooth, glossy and slick"". Despite this and despite labelling television studios a ""twentieth century torture chamber"", Macmillan got the best of the television coverage. His final address to the voters attracted the highest viewing figures of the entire campaign.  During the campaign, Macmillan proved himself a more skillful politician than Gaitskell. When the Labour leader promised to raise pensions, build more hospitals and keep taxes down he was greeted with suspicion by some voters. When he later promised to reduce purchase tax in addition to his previous commitments, the Tories were quick to exploit his gaffe with the gibe, ""A bribe a day keeps the Conservatives away"".  The Liberals, under leader Jo Grimond, fought a wider campaign than in previous years, contesting 216 seats compared to 110 in 1955. With the nation ready to cast their votes, the Conservatives had a 2-3 point lead over Labour.  Newsreaders discuss the swing to the Conservatives...  The Liberals' decision to field double the number of candidates compared to 1955, did see its share of the vote increase from 3% to 6%. However, their number of seats remained unchanged at six.  Macmillan had won by successfully portraying the Conservative Party as the party of prosperity. Two new Conservatives who entered the House for the first time on the back of Macmillan's success were Margaret Thatcher and Nicholas Ridley. The veteran Labour politician Herbert Morrison retired.  The Conservatives had now won their third successive election victory. This had not happened since the nineteenth century and some commentators began asking if the Labour Party would ever be returned to office."
543,"A Conservative member of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said its phone-hacking report would lose credibility for its line over Rupert Murdoch being unfit to run an international company.  Louise Mensch said no MPs from her party could support the report - looking into allegations around the former News of the World newspaper - which would now be seen as ""partisan"".  News Corporation said the suggestion that Rupert Murdoch was not ""fit"" to run the business, was ""unjustified""."

545,"The son of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was fined the equivalent of US$500,000 (£265,000) and given a four-year suspended jail term.  Sir Mark, who denies any knowledge of the plot, agreed a plea bargain and will now co-operate with investigators.  He left Cape Town on a flight to London's Heathrow on Thursday evening.  Sir Mark admitted breaking anti-mercenary legislation in South Africa by agreeing to finance a helicopter.  The businessman said he did not initially know the helicopter's alleged purpose - that it was to be used in the alleged coup attempt, instead believing it was to be used as an air ambulance.  But in his plea bargain statement, Sir Mark says he came to realise the helicopter was to be used for mercenary activities before the deal was finalised.  Speaking outside court, an emotional Sir Mark said: ""There is no price too high for me to pay to be reunited with my family and I am sure all of you who are husbands and fathers would agree with that.""  ""I know that what matters to Mark now is to be reunited with Diane and the children as soon as possible.""  Her son is now leaving South Africa for the first time in five months.  An advisor to Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that: ""We are confident that justice has been done,"" implying that they would no longer seek Sir Mark's extradition.  The BBC's Alastair Leithead said it seemed Sir Mark could now turn ""state witness"" as part of his co-operation with the South African authorities.  If Sir Mark had been unable to pay the three million rand fine, he would have incurred a five-year prison sentence, with his four-year suspended sentence on top of that.  Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean lawyer for a close friend of Sir Mark accused of leading the alleged coup plot, former SAS officer Simon Mann, says that his jail term has been reduced from seven years to four by a court in Harare.  Mann was last year found guilty of illegally buying weapons in Zimbabwe, which were allegedly intended to be used in the Equatorial Guinea coup plot.  A further 14 men were found guilty in Equatorial Guinea of being involved in the alleged plot to overthrow President Nguema, who has ruled Africa's third-largest oil producer for the past 25 years.  Nick du Toit was jailed for 34 years, while opposition leader Severo Moto, who is in exile in Spain, was given 63 years in absentia.  Both men escaped the death penalty demanded by the prosecution.  Sir Mark, 51, was arrested in August at his home in South Africa and released on bail.  News of Thursday's hearing in Cape Town came as a surprise. The defendant was not expected back in court until 18 February.  After his plea, his lawyers released a statement saying: ""It should be noted that Sir Mark was not charged with any involvement in the attempted coup d'etat in Equatorial Guinea.  ""The plea bargain was entered into solely as a result of his financing of the charter of a helicopter in circumstances where he should have exercised more caution.""  Sipho Ngwema, a spokesman for South Africa's Directorate of Special Investigations, also known as the Scorpions, said Sir Mark had promised to co-operate with South African investigators."
546,"Recent form: Not good. 14 defeats in 19 Tests going back to March 2006 is not exactly the sort of confidence-building run to inspire thoughts of retaining their world crown.  Coach: Brian Ashton. The 61-year-old Lancastrian earned his reputation as an innovative attacking strategist during Bath's glory years and later as Sir Clive Woodward's assistant from 1998 to 2002. Returned to the England set-up last May and succeeded Andy Robinson in the top job in December.  Captain: Phil Vickery. The son of a Devonian cattle farmer who learned his rugby in Cornwall, ""The Raging Bull"" has battled back from career-threatening back injuries to become Ashton's captain. A no-nonsense prop and World Cup winner four years ago, his bullocking runs can be inspirational.  World Cup pedigree: Defending champions, and the first European team to win it. Lost in the final on home soil at Twickenham, 12-6 to Australia, in 1991; thrashed by a Jonah Lomu-inspired New Zealand in 1995 semis. Quarter-final defeats to Wales, in 1987, and South Africa, in 1999.  World Cup high: Jonny Wilkinson's winning drop-goal, 26 seconds from the end of extra-time to clinch victory against Australia in the 2003 final, will take some beating.  World Cup low: A few to choose from, but losing the 1991 final at Twickenham after changing the tactics that got them there, probably caused the most angst. Quarter-final defeat to Springboks in Paris in 1999 was another downer.  World Cup legend: Jonny Wilkinson was the name on everyone's lips after the final four years ago. But the man who hoisted the Webb Ellis Trophy aloft in Sydney, then retired from international duty at the very top, would get the fans' vote. Martin Osborne Johnson, take a bow.  Present star: Wilkinson missed the next 30 England Tests in the three years after the World Cup victory with a horrendous run of injury problems. His sensational return in this year's Six Nations opener against Scotland, when he scored 27 points in a 42-20 win, cemented Jonny's star quality.  Maverick: The rise of scrum-half Shaun Perry, a former welder and self-confessed fan of fish 'n chips and a pint, from Dudley Kingswinford in the Midlands One League, via Coventry in National League One to Premiership Bristol, makes him a little different to most of his fellow Test colleagues.  Enforcer: Simon Shaw missed out on many a Test cap due to the presence of Martin Johnson. But with the great ""Johnno"" long gone, and none of the young pretenders filling his boots, veteran Shaw's time may finally have come. At 6ft 9in and 19 stone, he certainly has the tools for the job.  Strengths: It may not be the ""Dad's Army"" of 2003, but England's pack still contains enough grizzled old campaigners to provide a test for any set of forwards worth their salt. And Wilkinson's left boot remains a potent weapon.  Weaknesses: Lack the creativity and flair to turn possession supplied by a revitalised pack into points. And still unsure of their best side, with concerns at centre and full-back.  Did you know? Jonny Wilkinson, at 24, was the youngest member of England's World Cup-winning squad of 2003, a month younger than Iain Balshaw, also 24.  They say: ""There is a belief that we can surprise one or two people when the tournament starts. We still have a positive attitude amongst the players.""  Brian Ashton  You say: ""If Ashton has a few tricks up his sleeve and the backs show any form of creativity, I think England stand a reasonable chance.""  bobcom on 606  Our verdict: Semi-finals would be laudable given their decline since 2003. But getting out of their group will be tough enough, and a quarter-final could be the end of the line.  Ranking and odds correct at 26 August. Odds supplied by William Hill."
547,"The main roof of the pier, built in the East Sussex seaside town in the 1870s, has been completely destroyed, leaving only a metal skeleton.  The pier was evacuated. No-one was injured in the fire and police said it was not thought to be suspicious.  The fire service said late on Wednesday the incident was being scaled down and 30 firefighters were expected to stay at the scene overnight.  Eastbourne Borough Council leader David Tutt said he was hopeful the pier could be repaired and understood the fire had been started by an electrical fault.  ""The emergency services have done a fantastic job,"" he said.  ""The fact that as far as we're aware that nobody's hurt - we're not aware of anybody unaccounted for - they evacuated the site very quickly and they've managed to contain it to that front dome so there's hope of getting the pier restored.  ""The building which has been affected is the largest dome on the pier, and it has been badly damaged - but further down it looks as it's always looked.  ""My understanding... [is] it looks as if there was a problem with electrics in the wall of the dome between the two layers of the wall there and that seems to be where it started.""  The blaze broke out behind some wood panelling in the arcade building and billowing smoke filled the air.  Sian Ellis, a hotel manager in the town, said it was an ""absolute red, molten, mess of flame and smoke"".  ""We've just had another explosion there and it's very, very frightening and hugely saddening for the whole of the town,"" she said.  Fire minister Penny Mordaunt said she would be visiting Eastbourne ""as a priority"" to speak to local people and thank firefighters for their efforts.  ""It is heart-breaking to see such a wonderful Victorian pier so damaged. Thankfully no-one appears to have been hurt,"" she said.  About 80 firefighters had tackled the blaze in the privately-owned pier, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said.  A fire service spokesman said at one stage: ""Firefighters are using lifeboats to help tackle the fire from the sea and an aerial platform is being used as a water tower to prevent the fire from spreading on the shore side.""  He said crews had gone onto the pier from the seaward end to stop the fire spreading further along the structure.  Mark Sawyer, coxswain of Eastbourne Lifeboat, said: ""The main structure is gone now and it's a metal shell.""  Councillor Philip Ede, from Eastbourne Borough Council, who witnessed the fire, said: ""It looks pretty drastic from where I'm standing.  ""There's a lot of smoke and flames engulfing the first section of the pier. We pray the fire brigade can save as much of the building as possible.""  Des Pritchard, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service's chief fire officer, said: ""Our firefighters have saved a huge amount of the pier - there's a great deal that's still there.  ""It is very sad but pier fires are very difficult to fight and many result in the complete loss of the pier.""  A police spokeswoman added: ""It has been confirmed that the pier was safely and quickly evacuated and there was no-one trapped by the fire when it broke out.  ""The fire is not believed to be suspicious at this time.""  Ant Miller, who was on the beach when the fire broke out, said it quickly spread throughout the building.  ""There's quite a warm breeze here in Eastbourne today so it took pretty quickly,"" he said.  ""Within 20 minutes or so, lots of flames, lots of smoke. When we noticed it, it looked like the pier was evacuated pretty much immediately.""  Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd said it looked like the pier had been saved from being completely destroyed.  ""The good news is that we don't have a Brighton or Hastings scenario where the whole pier is destroyed,"" he said.  Airbourne, one of Eastbourne's biggest events, is due to take place on the seafront between 14 and 17 August.  The pier was built in the 1870s and, according to the Piers Society, previously had a theatre and a ""camera obscura"" built on it.  Today, a number of cafes, bars and a nightclub are situated along the pier.  It has featured in films and television programmes including the Michael Caine movie Last Orders and Brit flick Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging.  Hastings Pier was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 2010 and West Pier in Brighton burned down in 2003.  As someone raised on the sunshine coast, seeing the pier in flames has left me feeling deeply sad and unsettled.  The symbol of the town, its Victorian structure was the constant backdrop to my childhood of chilly dips in the sea.  It even played a part in the social structure of teenage years - with the beaches either side reserved for the coolest kids.  Later it was where we would drink local cider and snog boys, in the years before nights out involved tottering up to the nightclub at the end.  Within an hour of the news my Facebook feed was filled with local friends expressing sadness and shock that a key part part of the town's history could be so easily destroyed.  I just hope that it can be restored and not suffer the fate of the structures in neighbouring towns."
548,"Hundreds of RAF personnel are to be moved out of Northern Ireland, Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth has said.  He said it had been decided to relocate 230 Squadron, based at RAF Aldergrove, to RAF Benson in Oxfordshire.  ""This will establish a coherent Puma (helicopter) force on a single site, enabling the improvement of Puma force capability,"" Mr Ainsworth said.  About 100 of the 420 civilian staff at the County Antrim base could be made redundant because of the move.  A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said they were attempting to minimise compulsory redundancies.  Negotiations have begun with the trade unions about voluntary redundancies and possible moves to other government departments in Northern Ireland.  There will also be jobs available at RAF Benson for those who are prepared to move to England.  About 600 of the 700 RAF personnel on the Aldergrove base will be moved to England, along with most of the current 500 dependants.  The MoD then intends to relocate 38 Engineer Regiment from Massereene Barracks in Antrim to RAF Aldergorve. It will then be closed.  The relocations are expected to be completed by the end of 2010.  The cut-back is unconnected with the peace process reductions in troop levels and base closures which were finally completed in Northern Ireland by the MoD last autumn.  Mr Ainsworth said: ""These changes will not impact on our commitments in support of the civilian authorities in Northern Ireland.  ""Aldergrove will remain a military flying station for the Army Air Corps for the foreseeable future.""  He said the RAF would continue to use Northern Ireland airspace for training and a limited number of RAF personnel would remain in joint or specialist appointments in units in Northern Ireland.

549,"Sweden's national dish is an acquired taste, to say the least.  Some say surstromming, a fermented herring, smells like rubbish left out in the sun for days.  But now the fish has been banned from several major airlines, classified along with dangerous weapons like shoe bombs and firearms.  The Baltic herring is fermented in barrels for months before being put in tin cans, where the fermentation process continues.  The decision has made many Swedes very angry indeed.  Surstromming is as Swedish as Volvo and Ikea.  Some say it is simply rotten fish, which smells like rotten fish. Others argue it is the finest of delicacies.  But now major airlines like British Airways and Air France argue the cans are pressurised goods, and must be classified as potentially explosive.  The dish is no longer allowed on their flights, and the sale of the delicacy from Stockholm's international airport has been stopped.  That has made producers of the surstromming choke on their fermented fish, calling the airlines' decision ""culturally illiterate"".  It is a myth, they say, that the tinned fish can explode.  They admit, however, that a punctured tin would emit a foul smell, and that the content might spill quite forcefully, like a punctured can of beer.  But that is not enough to stop the export of a potent national symbol, the herring supporters argue.  The leader of the Swedish Surstromming Academy, an organisation promoting the dish nationally and internationally, said any airline worried about explosives and foul smells should first ban bottles of champagne and French cheese before attacking the pride of the Swedish cuisine."
550,"The company is also moving out of its Newcastle city centre base, where it began 45 years ago as one of ITV's first regional broadcasters.  The broadcaster says it is investing £6m in a new production centre near the giant MetroCentre complex in Gateshead.  Tyne Tees currently employs 200 people across sites on Tyneside, Teesside, Wearside and in London.  Managing director Graeme Thompson said: ""This is a major investment by ITV in the North East.  ""The prospect of moving from our old site to a production centre designed for the 21st Century is very exciting.  ""Obviously we are going to be sad about leaving City Road after 45 years. It has produced classics such as The Tube.""  Staff at the station mounted a protest over feared cuts after regulator Ofcom said it proposed to allow ITV companies in the English regions to cut their output by one-and-a-half hours a week."
551,"The 33-year-old has been on loan at Highbury since August 2005 as part of the deal taking young full-back Justin Hoyte to Sunderland.

""I am really pleased that Arsene Wenger and the coaches have shown faith in me,"" Poom told Arsenal's website.  ""I'm really enjoying it here at Arsenal and will continue to work hard in training, so that I am ready to hopefully feature in the first team in the near future.""

552,"Gateshead Thunder have rebranded as Newcastle Thunder, returning professional rugby league to the city for the first time since 1938.  As part of the change, Thunder have applied to Newcastle City Council to make Kingston Park their home ground.  The switch comes after Newcastle Rugby Limited, owned by Falcons rugby union chairman Semor Kurdi took over the rugby league side in May.  ""We're keen to make sure we don't forget our birthplace in Gateshead, but we have to ensure we move forward and unfortunately that means changing the name.""  Thunder play in Championship League One - two steps below the top-flight. The side previously played in the Super League as Gateshead in 1999.  Christie said one of the club's priorities would now be to build up the fan base.  ""We always want fans to come and it's a business decision we've taken to move here,"" he added.  The Rugby Football League has approved the name change."
553,"Samina Malik, from Southall, west London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of owning terrorist manuals.  The jury heard Malik had written extremist poems praising Osama Bin Laden, supporting martyrdom and discussing beheading.  Malik worked at WH Smith at Heathrow Airport until her arrest last October.  She had earlier been found not guilty of the more serious charge, under Section 57 of the Act, of possessing an article for a terrorist purpose. She denied the charges.  Malik burst into tears in the dock when the verdict was read out.  Following the verdict, Judge Peter Beaumont QC, the Recorder of London, told Malik: ""You have been in many respects a complete enigma to me.""  She had posted her poems on websites under the screen name the Lyrical Terrorist, prosecutors said.  Malik said the poems were ""meaningless"", but prosecutor Jonathan Sharp said: ""These communications strongly indicate Samina Malik was deeply involved with terrorist related groups.""  Police said they had found a ""library"" of extreme Islamist literature in her bedroom including The Al-Qaeda Manual and The Mujahideen Poisons Handbook.  The court also heard she had written on the back of a WH Smith till receipt: ""The desire within me increases every day to go for martyrdom.""  Malik said she had only called herself the Lyrical Terrorist ""because it sounded cool"".  She was convicted of having articles ""likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism"".  Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke, head of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""Malik held violent extremist views which she shared with other like-minded people over the internet. She also tried to donate money to a terrorist group.  ""She had the ideology, ability and determination to access and download material, which could have been useful to terrorists. Merely possessing this material is a serious criminal offence.""  Malik was bailed under what the judge described as ""house arrest"" until her sentencing on 6 December.  He warned her that ""all sentencing options"" remained open to him."
554,"Solskjaer, 33, has been out for almost two seasons through injury.  The Norwegian's sharp half-volley put United ahead, and he then cashed in on Innocent Mdledle's hesitation to put United two up at half time.  Kieran Richardson scored United's third with Francis Chansa's own goal rounding off the scoring.  Solskjaer accepted a role as club ambassador when he was handed a new two-year contract last season, and it looked as though he was preparing to wind down his career.  But the Old Trafford favourite showed his determination to press for a first-team place again, news Sir Alex Ferguson may be grateful for with Ruud van Nistelrooy apparently on his way out.  United's touring party was shorn of its World Cup players, but with Ryan Giggs, Wes Brown and Paul Scholes taking part, United still had a strong look about them.  Solskjaer's last senior goal for United was almost three years ago, but he showed all his old sharpness as he latched on to Gigg's flick to blast home a powerful half-volley.  The Norwegian's second goal showed he has lost none of his sharpness of brain as he picked the pocket of hesitating defender Innocent Mdelele to finish coolly.  The Pirates had enough going forward to give United a good work-out and with Wes Brown having an off-day, Blaise Lelo-Mbele had a chance to shine.  Goalkeeper Ben Foster, who will return to Watford for a season-long loan, was hardly tested, while Francis Chansa at the other end had to react to deny Richardson and Paul Scholes.  Scholes also looked lively after an injury-plagued season but it was Richardson who notched United's third, lashing home a shot from 20 yards after a defender's challenge teed up a shooting chance.  Chinese striker Dong Fangzhou impressed after coming on as a substitute and his cross led to United's fourth when panic-stricken defender Lehlo Seema lashed the ball against the luckless Chansa's head where it rebounded into the net."
555,"An average speed camera system should be in place on the A9 between Dunblane and Inverness by next summer, the Scottish government has said.  Transport Minister Keith Brown said it was among safety measures to be introduced on the road.  The average speed camera system will be the second in Scotland.  The first was installed on the A77 in Ayrshire between Bogend Toll and Ardwell Bay in 2005. It has been credited with improving safety.  Transport Scotland said it had delivered a 46% reduction in fatal accidents and 35% cut in serious accidents.  The cameras read the number plates of passing vehicles and measure the time it takes for them to pass from point A to point B, measuring average speed.  Mr Brown said it was ""extremely important"" that the A9 was as safe as possible.  He said: ""The A9 Safety Group has recommended that an average speed camera system is introduced to help cut down on the number of accidents and Transport Scotland will now take this forward.  ""While the Scottish government believes that dualling will be the long-term solution to the safety issues on the A9 - we are the first administration committed to making the road dual carriageway all the way from Perth to Inverness a reality - we also want to make the immediate improvements that will bring positive changes to driver behaviour.  ""Average speed cameras systems have a proven track record of reducing casualties and excessive speed and their high visibility leads to better compliance of the speed limit.  ""We hope to see the first of the cameras introduced early next year and expect the system to be fully operational in the summer of 2014.""  Supt Iain Murray, of Police Scotland, said any initiative that made roads safer was welcome.  He said: ""There is no doubt that this announcement will help to reduce the concerns of a great many people who have made their concerns about safety on the road known in recent days however it is clear that the introduction of the system will take some time.  ""I would therefore wish to reassure all road users that in the meantime the Trunk Roads Patrol Group will continue to provide a higher level of patrols on the A9, as well as other strategic routes in Scotland, to influence road user behaviour, encourage better driving and enforce legislation when required.""  Michael McDonnell, director of Road Safety Scotland, added: ""The A9 Safety Group's objective is to positively influence driver behaviours in a way that helps reduce road casualty figures.  ""It has been demonstrated in other locations that average speed cameras reduce the number of people being killed and seriously injured and this offers real potential to improve safety on the A9 ahead of the dualling programme.""  Earlier this month a senior police officer said higher priority should be given to improving the safety of the A9.  Ch Supt David O'Connor made his call in an open letter to the Scottish government.  It followed a two-vehicle fatal accident in which a mother and daughter from Edinburgh and a passenger in another car lost their lives.  The police officer, who is president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents (ASPS), said his comments were not intended to suggest any specific link to the recent tragic incident, as he was not aware of the detail.  Following the latest announcement, Ch Supt O'Connor said: ""Driver behaviour is one part of the problem and the introduction of average speed cameras should help drivers focus on this aspect of driving.  ""This is good news and another step towards making the A9 safer and I welcome the Scottish government multi-agency approach to addressing this serious problem.""  Dave Thompson, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said the introduction of cameras was a welcome move.  But he added: ""While the A9 remains a single carriageway in many sections, an unintended consequence of this move may be to increase frustration and this could even lead to risky overtaking.  ""Trucks and lorries are limited to 40mph on the single carriageway sections of the A9, and an average speed camera system will enforce this limit on them.  ""This will make it difficult for drivers of other vehicles, who are not limited to 40mph, to pass these slower moving trucks and lorries.""  Mr Thompson added: ""The impact of these speed cameras will be a big boost to safety on the A9, but it must be closely monitored to ensure that any unintended impacts on road safety are dealt with."""
556,"Although scientists believe they have categorically disproved the myth of Atlantis, the idea is more popular now than ever before. The latest exponent of the theory of a single lost source for all civilisation, is Graham Hancock. Although he doesn't call it Atlantis, his compelling ideas about a sophisticated society destroyed in a flood 12,000 years ago seem to be based on a reworking of the original Atlantis myth, whose survivors brought culture, religion, monument-building and civilisation to the rest of the world.  Graham Hancock offers various pieces of evidence to support his theory. He claims that the mysterious lost civilisation left its mark in ancient monuments, which he calculates were built to mirror certain constellations of stars. His hugely popular ideas have attracted such a wide audience that they stand to replace the conventional view of the past, which is based on scientific evidence that the civilisations of the ancient world were developed independently, by different peoples, on different continents.  Horizon journeys across the world to examine Hancock's evidence for a lost civilisation and puts his theory to the test.  Using modern astronomy, Hancock and his followers claim they can find messages from a lost society in the patterns of some of the greatest ancient monuments of the world. One colleague in particular, the author Robert Bauval, believes that the Giza pyramids in Egypt were built to mirror the stars of Orion's belt.  Hancock also believes that the great temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia mirror the constellation Draco as it would have appeared 12,000 years ago - at a time when the world was in the Stone Age. They see this as evidence that a great civilisation existed at this time, and later conveyed its wisdom to the peoples of the ancient world, before disappearing without trace from the archaeological record.  Astronomers, archaeologists and geologists study this evidence. Dr. Ed Krupp of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, is troubled by Bauval's claims.  Horizon further examines Hancock's claims that the Sphinx and the mysterious ancient city of Tihuanacu in Bolivia were built 12,000 years ago by survivors of the lost civilisation itself.  It considers the idea that either Antarctica or an extraordinary underwater site at Yonaguni in Japan were the original home of these vanished people. In a film full of contentious debate and powerful arguments, Graham Hancock's claims are pitted against cutting edge scientific analysis to discover whether his popular theory could be true."
557,"Over the last 11,700 years - an epoch that geologists call the Holocene - climate has remained remarkably stable.  This allowed humans to plan ahead, inventing agriculture, cities, communication networks and new forms of energy.  Some geologists now believe that human activity has so irrevocably altered our planet that we have entered a new geological age.  This proposed new epoch - dubbed the Anthropocene - is discussed at a major conference held at the Geological Society in London on Wednesday. Yet some experts say that defining this ""human age"" is much more than about understanding our place in history. Instead, our whole future may depend on it.  The term, the Anthropocene, was coined over a decade ago by Nobel Laureate chemist, Paul Crutzen.  Professor Crutzen recalls: ""I was at a conference where someone said something about the Holocene. I suddenly thought this was wrong. The world has changed too much. No, we are in the Anthropocene. I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked. But it seems to have stuck.""  But is Professor Crutzen correct? Has the Earth really flipped into a new geological epoch - and if so, why is this important?  Dr Jan Zalasiewicz of the University of Leicester is one of the leading proponents of the Anthropocene theory. He told BBC News: ""Simply put, our planet no longer functions in the way that it once did. Atmosphere, climate, oceans, ecosystems… they're all now operating outside Holocene norms. This strongly suggests we've crossed an epoch boundary.""  Dr Zalasiewicz added: ""There are three ideas about when the Anthropocene began. Some people think it kicked off thousands of years ago with the rise of agriculture, but really those first farmers didn't change the planet much.  ""Others put the boundary around 1800. That was the year that human population hit one billion and carbon dioxide started to significantly rise due to the burning of fossil fuels in the Industrial Revolution,"" he explained.  ""However, the really big changes didn't get going until the end of the Second World War - and that's another candidate for the boundary.""  To formally define a new epoch, geologists must show how it can be recognised in the layers of mud that will eventually form rocks. As it turns out, there is enormous practical advantage in fixing 1945 as the beginning of the Anthropocene.  ""1945 was the dawn of the nuclear age,"" explained Dr Zalasiewicz. ""Sediments deposited worldwide that year contain a tell-tale radioactive signature from the first atom bomb tests in the States"".  So, thousands of years from now, geologists (if any still exist) will be able to place their finger on that very layer of mud.  Nonetheless, the choice of 1945 for start of the Anthropocene is much more than just convenient. It coincides with an event that Professor Will Steffen of the Australian National University describes as the ""Great Acceleration"".  Professor Steffen told the BBC: ""A few years ago, I plotted graphs to track the growth of human society from 1800 to the present day. What I saw was quite unexpected - a remarkable speeding up after the Second World War"".  In that time, the human population has more than doubled to an astounding 6.9 billion. However, much more significantly, Professor Steffen believes, the global economy has increased ten-fold over the same period.  ""Population growth is not the big issue here. The real problem is that we're becoming wealthier and consuming exponentially more resources,"" he explained.  This insatiable consumption has placed enormous stresses on our planet. Writing in the prestigious journal Nature, Professor Steffen and colleagues recently identified nine ""life support systems"" essential for human life on Earth. They warned that two of these - climate and the nitrogen cycle - are in danger of failing, while a third - biodiversity - is already in meltdown.  ""One of the most worrying features of the Great Acceleration is biodiversity loss,"" Professor Steffen said. ""Species extinction is currently running 100 to 1000 times faster than background levels, and will increase further this century.""  ""When humans look back… the Anthropocene will probably represent one of the six biggest extinctions in our planet's history."" This would put it on a par with the event that wiped out the dinosaurs.  But perhaps more alarming is the possibility that the pronounced global warming seen at the start of the proposed Anthropocene epoch could be irreversible. ""Will climate change prove to be a short-term spike that quickly returns to normal, or are we seeing a long term move to a new stable state?"" asked Professor Steffen. ""That's the million dollar question.""  If the Anthropocene does develop into a long-lived period of much warmer climate, then there may be one very small consolation: the fossil record of modern human society is likely to be preserved in amazing detail.  Dr Mike Ellis of the British Geological Survey told BBC News: ""As a result of rising sea level, scientists of the future will be able to explore the relics of whole cities buried in mud"".  In New Orleans, large areas of the city are already below sea level. The disastrous combination of rising sea level and subsidence of the Mississippi Delta on which it is built suggest that it will succumb at some point in the future.  Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts less than a metre of sea level rise over the next 90 years, more than five metres of sea level rise is possible over the coming centuries as the Greenland and West Antarctic ice caps melt.  One application for exploring the changing coastlines of the Anthropocene world is Google Flood. It allows users to raise sea level by up to 14 metres and zoom into street level to see the effects.  Sea level rise of this magnitude will mean that the lower storeys of buildings will be preserved intact. Such ""urban strata will be a unique, widespread and easily recognisable feature of the sedimentary deposits of the human age"", Dr Ellis commented.  Geologists of the future may also hunt for other, more unusual, ""markers"" of the Anthropocene epoch, such as the traces of plastic packaging in sediments.  But geologists like Dr Mark Williams from the University of Leicester hold much more serious concerns: ""One of the main reasons we developed the Anthropocene concept was to quantify present-day change and compare it with the geological record,"" he explained. ""Only when we do so, can we critically assess the pace and degree of change that we're currently experiencing.""  Dr Williams added that while the Anthropocene has yet to run its course, ""all the signs are that the human age will be a stand-out event in the 4.5 billion year history of the Earth""."
558,"O'Sullivan has battled personal troubles to return to the top World champion Ronnie O'Sullivan found his stunning top gear to crush Stoke underdog Dave Harold 9-3 and claim the Northern Ireland Trophy in Belfast. In doing so ""The Rocket"" became the first player for four years to win back-to-back ranking titles. World number 28 Harold won the opening frame of the match, but O'Sullivan, 32, raced into a five-frame lead. Harold fared little better in the evening session as O'Sullivan sealed the first ranking event of the season. I wanted to blow away a few cobwebs at this tournament, but to win it is a nice bonus    After recording the 21st ranking title of his career, in which he posted breaks of 68, 103, 84, 76, 64 and 50 to triumph, O'Sullivan played down his performance. ""I played OK in patches and I was decent in patches,"" he said. ""I got on top of Dave after the first frame, but the first four frames tonight I wasn't there. ""I wanted to blow away a few cobwebs at this tournament, but to win it is a nice bonus. ""I'm still working on a few things technically, but there's still a few things I can improve on."" Has Ronnie still got a lot more in his locker? Harold, 41, whose last title came 15 years ago when he won the 1993 Asian Open, now moves up to number 14 in the rankings after his successful run in Belfast. ""I started well, won the first frame and then I could have won the second frame,"" he said. ""But I let it slip after that. ""Ronnie's a class player, he punishes you every time you make a mistake. ""As a pure player and a entertainer, he's the best ever. Hopefully it won't be another 15 years until my next final."""
559,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has begun hearing a complaint from collapsed Russian oil company Yukos against the Russian government.  Yukos first faced allegations of tax fraud in 2002 and was ultimately liquidated in 2007.  But the firm claims that it was ""targeted"" by the Russian authorities and illegally driven out of business.  Yukos representatives first filed the claim with the ECHR in 2004. They are seeking $98bn (£65bn) in compensation.  Yukos founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed for eight years in 2005 for tax evasion and other offences.  Russian authorities began pursuing Yukos in 2002, accusing it of creating shell companies to hide revenue from the tax authorities.  Yukos, once Russia's biggest oil company, struggled to survive after facing a series of tax demands totalling $27bn.  It eventually had its assets frozen and was forced to sell its shares in other companies.  The firm was declared insolvent in 2006 and was liquidated the following year.  Yukos claims that the Russian government's actions were ""unlawful, disproportionate, arbitrary and discriminatory, and amounted to disguised expropriation"" of the company.  The ECHR agrees to hear about one in 20 applications that it receives.  Its rulings are binding on all 47 members of the Council of Europe, which includes Russia.  Past rulings have obliged governments to amend legislation and administrative practices."
560,"England one-day captain Alastair Cook married his childhood sweetheart - and celebrated with a tractor ride.  The opening batsman tied the knot with model Alice Hunt on Saturday after spending Christmas helping out on her family farm in Hockliffe, Bedfordshire.  Many of Cook's England team-mates - Andrew Strauss, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Matt Prior, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Graeme Swann, Tim Bresnan and Steven Finn - attended the service at Stewkley Methodist Church in Buckinghamshire.  They then joined dozens of well-wishers lining the streets as the happy couple shunned tradition to leave church on a tractor.  Cook, who scored 766 runs in England's successful Ashes campaign in Australia last winter, has enjoyed another memorable festive period.  He was shortlisted for BBC Sports Personality of the Year, won the Team of the Year award with England and turned 27 on Christmas Day.  He and his international colleagues fly to the United Arab Emirates on Monday for the Test and limited-overs series against Pakistan."
561,"The flash of radiation on 27 December was so powerful that it bounced off the Moon and lit up the Earth's atmosphere.  The blast occurred on the surface of an exotic kind of star - a super-magnetic neutron star called SGR 1806-20.  If the explosion had been within just 10 light-years, Earth could have suffered a mass extinction, it is said.  One calculation has the giant flare on SGR 1806-20 unleashing about 10,000 trillion trillion trillion watts.  ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime event. We have observed an object only 20km across, on the other side of our galaxy, releasing more energy in a 10th of a second than the Sun emits in 100,000 years,"" said Dr Fender.  The event overwhelmed detectors on space-borne telescopes, such as the recently launched Swift observatory.  This facility was put above the Earth to detect and analyse gamma-ray bursts - very intense but fleeting flashes of radiation.  The giant flare it and other instruments caught in December has left scientists scrambling for superlatives.  The light detected from the giant flare was far brighter in gamma-rays than visible light or X-rays.  Research teams say the event can be traced to the magnetar SGR 1806-20.  This remarkable super-dense object is a neutron star - it is composed entirely of neutrons and is the remnant collapsed core of a once giant star.  Now, though, this remnant is just 20km across and spins so fast it completes one revolution every 7.5 seconds.  ""It has this super-strong magnetic field and this produces some kind of structure which has undergone a rearrangement - it's an event that is sometimes characterised as a 'star-quake', a neutron star equivalent of an earthquake,"" explained Dr Fender.  ""It's the only possible way we can think of releasing so much energy.""  SGR 1806-20 is sited in the southern constellation Sagittarius. Its distance puts it beyond the centre of the Milky Way and a safe distance from Earth.  ""Had this happened within 10 light-years of us, it would have severely damaged our atmosphere and would possibly have triggered a mass extinction,"" said Dr Bryan Gaensler, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who is the lead author on one of the forthcoming Nature papers.  ""Fortunately there are no magnetars anywhere near us.""  The initial burst of high-energy radiation subsided quickly but there continues to be an afterglow at longer radio wavelengths.  This radio emission persists as the shockwave from the explosion moves out through space, ploughing through nearby gas and exciting matter to extraordinary energies.  ""We may go on observing this radio source for much of this year,"" Dr Fender said.  This work is being done at several centres around the globe, including at the UK's Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (Merlin) and the Joint Institute for VLBI (Very Long Baseline for Interferometry) in Europe - both large networks of linked radio telescopes."
562,"One week before a court sentenced him to death for his part in the Bali bombing, Amrozi appeared before the media to sing a song. ""Continue the holy struggle, get rid of Zionists, get rid of the Christian filth. God is great, this is my song,"" he sang, smiling broadly from behind a prison compound's bars. It was not the first time Amrozi's behaviour had created surprise. After his arrest in November 2002, his seeming good humour earned him the sobriquet of ""the smiling bomber"", as well as the vitriol of the press in Australia, where many of the Bali attack's victims lived. And he surprised police by saying Americans were their intended victims, when Australians were far more likely visitors to the island. Amrozi bin Nurhasyim was born in 1962 in the sleepy village of Tenggulun, a few miles inland from the coast of East Java, the fifth of 13 children. Described as something of a black sheep, Amrozi did not do well at school, appearing more interested in motorbikes and girls. The Bali blasts killed more than 200 people His mother, Haji Tariyem, told the BBC that Amrozi was a good boy, who at the time of the Bali attacks was living at home looking after his sick father. Villagers in Tenggulun have said that Amrozi left for Malaysia in the late 1980s in search of work, and returned in 1991 with much stronger Islamic beliefs. While in Malaysia, police said he was reunited with his elder brother, Mukhlas, a deeply religious man and also on trial for the Bali attack. Amrozi has described Mukhlas as an inspiration to him. Police said that when Mukhlas returned to Tenggulun, he became more involved in the village's Al Islam boarding school, founded by another of Amrozi's brothers, where about 150 students follow a strictly religious curriculum. Amrozi is said to have admitted meeting the Muslim preacher Abu Bakar Ba'asyir on several occasions - while Mr Ba'asyir was in exile in Malaysia in the 1990s and more recently after the preacher's return in 1998, when he was invited to speak at the Al Islam school. Mr Ba'asyir is thought to be the founder and spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, a shadowy, regional network of militants thought to have carried out a number of attacks across South East Asia. Amrozi angered families of the Bali bombing victims when he was paraded before the media in November waving and laughing, and was quoted as saying that he was ""delighted"" by the attack because they had destroyed ""places of sin"". ""With this incident, God willing, many people realised that they had forgotten God and neglected their worship and avoided places of worship,"" he said. ""Often things we don't like are in fact good for us,"" he added. General I Made Mangku Pastika, chief of the investigation, said Amrozi showed no remorse for his involvement. ""He's very calm, very cool... proud of his activities,"" he said. Mr Pastika said Amrozi's only regret about the bombing was the fact that most of the dead were Australians rather than Americans. ""He doesn't regret it but he is just unhappy,"" Mr Pastika added."

564,"In addition to the apology, the monks will get a replacement cow The RSPCA is to apologise for the way in which it put down one of the sacred cows at a Hindu temple in Watford, Hertfordshire. The cow, a 13-year-old Jersey-Belgian Blue cross named Gangotri, had been injured more than a year earlier and was no longer able to stand. The monks accused the RSPCA of ""tricking"" them into letting them have access to the cow at Bhaktivedanta Manor Temple and giving her a lethal injection on 13 December last year. The action led to widespread anger among British Hindus, for whom all life is sacred. Cattle in particular are venerated, and all the animals kept at the temple in Watford are allowed to die naturally. Gangotri's ashes were taken to be scattered at the source of the River Ganges, also considered sacred by Hindus. Hindu monks - dressed in saffron robes - demonstrated in Westminster and outside the RSPCA's headquarters in Horsham in Sussex. We know that our actions caused a lot of hurt    Gangotri was killed five months after a bitter dispute over the fate of another sacred Hindu animal, Shambo, a bull who was taken from a Welsh monastery after testing positive for tuberculosis. Monks had to be forcibly removed by the police from a cordon around his stall. Shambo - who was slaughtered after the monks lost a court battle to save him - sparked particular anger because he showed no signs of the disease. Monks at Bhaktivedanta Temple accept that Gangotri had been injured, but claimed she was recovering. Now the RSPCA is to apologise, taking out an advertisement in at least one newspaper serving the Asian community. The apology will stress the common ground between the RSPCA and the Hindu monks on the need to prevent harm to animals. An RSPCA spokesman said: ""We are apologising for any hurt or offence caused by our actions last year. ""We know that our actions caused a lot of hurt to sensitivities, and we are now looking at how we can work together in the future. ""We followed the law of the land... but that can in the end offend people."" Significantly, the full statement will express regret only for the hurt and offence caused by the killing of Gangotri, not for the act itself. The RSPCA insists that its action - backed up by an official warrant - did comply with the law, and it denies using trickery to gain access to her stall. The nature of the apology is important because it leaves largely unresolved the wider conflict between a contemporary ""western"" attitude to animal life - in which preventing disease and discomfort takes priority - and the Hindu priority, to preserve life. In addition to the apology, the monks will get a replacement cow. They have asked for a Meuse-Rhine Issel cow, a hardy and high-yielding milker from Holland and Germany. The monks have asked that the cow be already in calf, and say that if the calf turns out to be a bull, it would be used for field work at the Temple rather than being slaughtered as usually happens."
565,"Bookies have installed Mercury Prize-nominee PJ Harvey as joint favourite alongside Adele to win this year's prestigious trophy and its £20,000 prize money.  Her album Let England Shake is her fourth nomination but she also won the award in 2001 for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea.  It makes her the most successful artist in the prize's history (Radiohead have also been nominated for four but have failed to win).  Let England Shake documents man's self-destructive propensity for war and Harvey spent two years researching warfare, in particular the first world war.  The Guardian's five-star review called it a richly inventive album that's unlike anything else in Harvey's back catalogue.  I found out on the day. Obviously, I knew that the announcement was coming up and I hoped that the record would make it in because, for me, I think it's probably one of my best pieces of work.  It's always wonderful to have some recognition and the Mercury prize is a good platform for that and I'm just really delighted that it's been acknowledged.  I've never been the sort of person to think too much about those sorts of things or to think about how I am perceived because the most important thing is to concentrate on my work and improve at it.  I find that quite all-consuming and it's much healthier for me as a person to keep that as my focus and judge my work by how I feel about it and what my aims were initially and if I feel I achieved that, rather than by what other people think of it.  I always try and keep up to date with all types of new music. I make that part of my work actually, I think it's important to know what sphere you're operating in as an artist. So yes, I keep up to date.  Having said that, there's very little that I find of interest and I tend to go back to the music that's always fed and nourished me for inspiration.  I do have an appalling memory and I think the first nomination was for Rid Of Me, and I really can't remember anything about it. I can't even remember going. Did I go? I don't think I was there, I was probably on tour - we did very lengthy tours in the early days. I've a vague memory of being invited and being in another part of the world.  Quite naturally I look back at that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day - it didn't have much importance in the grand scheme of things.  Still, it was a monumental day which I'll never forget. Doing the acceptance down a telephone, I remember vividly looking out of the window at armoured tanks driving up and down outside our hotel and whole city was on lockdown. We weren't allowed to leave Washington until late that night to get to our next show.  It was a very surreal day.  It's really astonishing, actually, how much people have wanted to come and tell me what the record means to them and how much it's affected their lives. It's really overwhelmed me and that's been from all walks of life, whether they have been involved in war zones or not.  But there have been people that have worked with refugees in east Timor, war veterans from as far afield as New Zealand and Australia - people just reaching out to want to say, 'thank you, this means a lot to me,' so it continues to humble me, it's wonderful to get feedback like that"
566,"The number of political prisoners in Cuba has fallen from 201 to 167 since the beginning of 2010, the unofficial Cuban Human Rights Commission says.  This is almost half the number of political prisoners compared with when Fidel Castro handed over power to his younger brother Raul four years ago.  But the commission's head Elizardo Sanchez says the fall reflects a change in the manner of political repression.  He says harassment and intimidation are now replacing long prison sentences.  A report by the illegal but tolerated Cuban Human Rights Commission cites more than 800 cases of people being detained this year then later sent home without charge.  But there are signs that President Raul Castro may be about to release more dissidents.  The Cuban authorities were stung by the widespread international outcry, following the death of a jailed dissident hunger striker in February.  Another hunger striker, Guillermo Farinas, who is campaigning for the release of the most seriously ill prisoners, is currently in a critical condition in hospital.  One paraplegic dissident was released, following mediation by the Roman Catholic Church.  Now Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Morantinos is due in Havana shortly to help support the church's efforts, amid reports from Madrid that 26 sick prisoners are being considered for release."
567,"A bomb has exploded in the Post Office tower causing extensive damage but no injuries.  The blast occurred at 0430GMT on the 33rd floor of the tower and shortly after police received a call from a man claiming that the ""Kilburn Battalion"" of the IRA was behind the attack.  A senior detective said: ""The incident has all the hallmarks of the IRA. The explosives experts feel this was a professional job.""  Security at all public buildings is now being stepped up as police fear the start of a wave of terror attacks.  It is believed the bomb, which blew out foot-thick walls, was planted in a toilet on the lowest of the public viewing galleries.  A warning was given and the building thoroughly checked but nothing was found.  General manager of the tower restaurant Guido Edwards said: ""We have had about 100 hoax calls in the last five years.  ""We inspected the cloakrooms and nooks and crannies and believed the restaurant was safe.""  Police are now trying to ascertain how the bomb was planted. A search was carried out in the area where the bomb was left after the last of the public visitors had gone. It is thought that a diner in the restaurant building may have gained access to an internal staircase leading to the other floors. Buildings and cars up to 400 yards away were damaged in the blast and some local residents reported being shaken from their beds. Work has begun to clear away the debris but is likely to take days due to the unsteady nature of the area. However, there is no danger of the tower collapsing as the main support comes from an internal central structure."
568,"The Skynet 5B platform will ride into orbit atop an Ariane 5 rocket from the Kourou spaceport, in French Guiana.  It will join the 5A satellite lofted successfully in March and which is already handling secure traffic for UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The investment includes replacing and updating control centres, and the major antennas and terminals used by military ships, land vehicles and planes to communicate through the satellites.  The 5B spacecraft is waiting on the launch pad in Kourou for a flight timed to start at 1904 local time (2204 GMT).  ""We've had an incredibly smooth launch campaign so far, and now we're in the final stages,"" said Patrick Wood, who has led the development of both spacecraft for manufacturer EADS Astrium.  ""There are a series of umbilical connections and we communicate with 5B night and day. We're doing final battery charging, making sure it is optimised for launch,"" he told BBC News.  Skynet 5 will allow the Army, Royal Navy and RAF to pass much more data, faster between command centres.  The bandwidth capacity is two-and-a-half times that of the previous satellite constellation, Skynet 4.  Although they look much like any of the other modern commercial telecommunications spacecraft launched from Kourou, the 5s incorporate new technologies specially prepared for military use.  The spacecraft have also been ""hardened"" to withstand any interference - attempts to disable or take control of the satellites - and any efforts to eavesdrop on their sensitive communications.  They each have advanced receive antennas that enable the spacecraft to selectively listen to signals and filter out attempts to ""jam"" them.  They will also resist attempts to disrupt them with high-powered lasers.  ""Hardened doesn't mean armour-plated, because the cost of launching a spacecraft like that would be phenomenal and the amount of useable payload in it would be very small,"" explained Mr Wood.  ""But Skynet 5 does incorporate electronic - and some physical - protection that will help the spacecraft in some types of adverse environment.""  The benefits of the upgrade should become evident when the UK starts using Predator unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support troops in Afghanistan.  These aircraft will stream real-time video of Taleban activity and, with the capacity of Skynet 5, those pictures can be fed back to the UK quickly for further analysis, if necessary.  The UK military increasingly talks about NEC - Network Enabled Capability. It describes modern commanders taking rapid decisions based on superior information - enabling them to deploy equipment and personnel far more effectively than has been possible in the past.  The abundance of information has to be managed, however.  Tony Skinner, from Jane's Defence Weekly, said British commanders had admitted they were still learning how best to handle what is becoming a flood of information.  ""As some of these new systems are coming online, and the communication bearers increase capacity, the armed forces have to work out the human processes, standards and protocols needed to use the information efficiently,"" Mr Skinner explained.  ""Also, your systems have to be interoperable, especially working in a coalition environment. It's all very well taking a video stream from a drone but can you share that with friendly forces, other bases and even back to the UK?""  The cost of the Skynet project has raised eyebrows, not least because it has been financed through a private company with City money.  Paradigm Secure Communications won a contract with the Ministry of Defence to supply satellite services to UK forces.  The contract called for two new spacecraft and, because of the way the financing deal was put together, will allow for an in-orbit spare, Skynet 5C to be launched next year.  The MoD is currently struggling to tie down the details of another major PFI (Private Finance Initiative) to overhaul the RAF's mid-air re-fuelling tankers, but Paradigm managing director, Malcolm Peto, is in no doubt the novel procurement route is good value.  ""This is the way to do it,"" he said.  ""Other European militaries and procurement agencies have been sceptical that we could put this satcom network and services together.  ""But with one satellite already in orbit, people are starting to take notice. With two in orbit we will have nothing left to prove.""  Skynet 5A looks over the Atlantic Ocean. 5B will occupy a position above the Indian Ocean. Together, they will provide coverage from the eastern US seaboard to east of China."
569,"BBC News website readers contacted us and asked us to investigate whether unauthorised overdraft fees were legal.  We looked into it - and reported back to the readers.  Deborah Alexander, 38, a teacher from London, has recently paid more than £500 in bank charges.  When on maternity leave I kept going slightly over my overdraft limit by £10 or £15 and incurring heavy charges.  I was refused an overdraft extension and the bank seemed more interested in trying to get me to take out a loan which would have meant me paying more interest over the long-run, which I wasn't happy with.  I feel hurt by this experience, as I have been a customer of the bank for 21 years. Since they refused my request for an overdraft extension of £500, they have debited at least this in interest and charges.     Rhiannon Roberts, 22, a student from York, hit with £56 in charges for 37p debt.  I went over my overdraft limit by 37p - and was automatically charged £28. I queried this and had it reduced to £14, which I thought was still quite harsh but a lesson learned. It was the first time I had ever done anything like this.  I was then shocked when my statement arrived to find that I had been charged a further £28 because the 37p unauthorised overdraft had occurred over two monthly charging periods. Totally unjustified and out of proportion.     Nick Campbell, 26, a maths student at Imperial College London, faced £152 in charges for £1.20 debt.  My bank refused to authorise a direct debit payment and charged me £38. This charge then pushed me into unauthorised overdraft, sparking another £38 charge.  When my credit card tried again to collect the direct debit another set of charges were sparked.  It is incredible that from such a small amount I have been hit with such high charges.  Bank charges are a disgrace. When you are down financially they kick you.     No bank or building society would divulge the money made from unauthorised overdraft fees, on the grounds that it was ""commercially sensitive"" information.  However, research by Which? suggests that one in four UK bank customers were hit by unauthorised overdraft fees during 2004, for a total cost of £3bn.  Recently - and unexpectedly - the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) ripped into the banking industry's charging regime.  The OFT said that in the future, credit card late repayment charges in excess of £12 would be considered unfair and likely to be challenged in the courts.  Charges, the regulator argued, ""should only reflect the administrative costs of dealing with the default"".  Not all that dramatic a statement, perhaps, when applied to just the credit card industry.  But when the OFT said the same principle would also apply to default charges on overdrafts, you could almost hear the gasps from UK's banks and building societies.  A senior banking executive told BBC News that the OFT's decision to came as a ""bolt out of the blue"".  ""We had absolutely no idea they were going to do this,"" the executive, who wished to remain unnamed, told BBC News.  ""One is left with the impression of a regulator that isn't doing its job properly.""  But ultimately, whatever the current account providers think of the regulator's methods, the OFT move could mean the charges imposed on consumers for going into the red have to come down.  The Bank Action Group (BAG) was formed in January as a self-help organisation showing consumers how they can go about legally claiming back bank charges.  So far, according to the BAG website, nearly 200 people have received refunds but none of these cases have made it to court.  Dave Smith, one of the group's two founding members, says he sees this as a sign the banks and building societies are ""running scared"".  For their part, the banks argue that the number of requests amounts to only a miniscule proportion of their customer base.  The Royal Bank of Scotland group, for example - with 13.5 million current account holders - told BBC News that it had received requests for refunds but that the numbers as yet were ""pretty small"".  According to Mr Smith, there is a lengthy - if straightforward - process process consumers wanting a refund have to go through.  ""First they ask their bank or building society to detail all bank charges going back six years,"" he says. ""They have to provide this information under the terms of the Data Protection Act.  ""The consumer then writes stating their intention to sue in the county court for return of the charges.  ""Under breach of contract law, penalty charges - such as those imposed for exceeding an overdraft limit - are unlawful. The banks know this.""  Lisa McLean, consumer lawyer at Laytons, told BBC News that some unauthorised overdraft fees may indeed be unlawful.  ""Banks have a right under English law to claim damages from customers who, for example, exceed their overdraft limits and are therefore in breach of their contract with the bank,"" she says.  ""But the banks don't want to have to go to court to claim damages every time a customer exceeds an overdraft limit, so they include these specific charges in their agreements. The bank can automatically raise charges as its remedy.  ""Some customers and consumer groups claim that these charges exceed the banks' actual damages when an overdraft limit is exceeded.  ""If that is the case, the charges will amount to penalties, which are unenforceable.""  But Ms McLean added the legality of charges had yet to be tested in the courts - with some providers, it seems, at this stage preferring to refund consumers.  ""If the issue did get that far, the court would establish whether or not the charges in a particular case were a genuine assessment of the bank's damages, or actually an unenforceable penalty,"" she says.  ""Anyone else incurring similar charges would then be able to rely on that case to defend themselves against their own bank's charges.""  Joanna Elson, executive director of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), was keen to stress that unauthorised overdraft fees were not a penalty but a fee for a service.  ""The customer has not had the loan agreed. It is not that difficult to arrange an overdraft,"" she says.  ""In many cases, the current account provider protects the customer's reputation by not bouncing cheques and direct debits.""  Ms Elson added that the BBA's own research had shown that UK banking customers enjoyed a better deal than their mainland European counterparts.  ""In the UK, free banking is a reality in other parts it is not,"" she argues. ""Many people abroad have to pay tariffs for cashing cheques as well as a monthly management fee.""  Seymour Fortescue, chief executive of the Banking Code Standards Board (BSCB), which administers the voluntary rules governing how financial institutions treat their customers, told BBC News that reform of charging was necessary.  ""Disturbingly, the charges fall hardest on people on low incomes, such as students, who can least afford them,"" Seymour Fortescue, chief executive of the BSCB told BBC News.  ""What I would like to see is greater transparency over charging,"" he says.  ""There should be a summary box on statements outlining all the charges and a 14-day notification period before a charge is imposed.  ""This should ease the problem of charges being imposed on charges.""  The readers respond to what we have found  I feel the charges applied to my account are definitely penalties and not an accurate cost of administering any excess.  As for my reputation: if the bank is really concerned with maintaining it, why have they charged me ever-increasing amounts when they know I have a limited income - and have inevitably increased my debt?  If banks were sure of themselves and believed that they were administering charges fairly, they would go to court to prove their point and ensure they did not lose such a lucrative source of income.     The idea of a 14-day notification period sounds very good to me.  They should also have an alert system on your online banking account. I'm sure that kind of thing is easy enough to set up.  Whether or not we have a better deal than abroad is irrelevant. If the charges aren't legal under UK law than they should be changed, and one should not have to write numerous letters and threaten court action to get charges revoked.  The banks rely on knowing that most people won't do that so they get away with it.     I find the BBA argument that the UK 'is better than Europe' not very comforting.  The fact is, I expect to pay some sort of charge when I have exceeded my balance, what I object to is the high amount and the sheer aggressiveness of the charges that has come about over the last few years.  Banks will refuse to take into account any mitigating circumstances. They have adopted the attitude of 'tough luck, pay up', and will hit consumers with multiple charges in only a few days.  I urge anyone who has been charged to start asking his or her bank questions.  It is becoming clear they are very nervous about this issue and will have no alternative but to review their policy if enough of their customers start asking questions.   "
570,"Nigel Farage is to remain as UKIP leader after the party rejected his resignation.  Mr Farage had previously said he would stand down after failing to win a seat in last week's general election.  But the party said there was ""overwhelmingly evidence"" that UKIP members did not want Mr Farage to go.  Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Farage said he had been ""reluctant"", but decided he ""owed it to the party to stay"" on as leader.  UKIP won a 13% vote share in the election - some 3.8 million votes - and has one MP, Douglas Carswell, who held his Clacton seat.  It puts the party in third place behind the Conservatives and Labour in terms of share of the vote.  Mr Farage failed to gain the seat of Thanet South, losing out to Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay.  Speaking about his defeat, he insisted he had ""never felt happier"", with a ""weight lifted off his shoulders"".  Who is more important to UKIP, Nigel Farage or Douglas Carswell?  The answer to that question came just before 16:00 BST when the party announced its ex-leader was now its leader again. Nigel Farage has been persuaded to stay on.  Technically he has managed to honour his pledge to stand down after he failed to get elected in Thanet South on Thursday.  Two things are now clear: UKIP can't countenance a post-Nigel world. He is the party's biggest asset and it thinks a big chunk of those four million votes last week were down to him.  But one senior figure has told the BBC Mr Farage's decision to stay is a ""mistake"" which will only undermine his reputation for straight talking.  I think it's a safe bet to say that UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, will not be happy. He heaped praise on his leader this morning but he spoke about him very much in the past tense.  Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a ""great success"" and members had ""unanimously"" rejected Mr Farage's letter of resignation.  ""He has therefore been persuaded to withdraw his resignation and remains leader of UKIP,"" a party statement said.  Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage said he had initially been reluctant, but then ""breathed deep, and thought for as long as I possibly had, given the meeting was ongoing"".  ""I decided that as much as I had earned my holidays. As much as I wanted to spend the summer fishing, walking, and of course, in the European Parliament where all hell is currently breaking loose - that I owed it to the party that got me here,"" he said.  He added there were ""huge battles ahead"", such as new EU proposals for Mediterranean migrant quotas and issues of electoral reform.  Mr Farage had said repeatedly ahead of and during the general election campaign he had no intention of staying in the leader's job.  In his autobiography, The Purple Revolution, he wrote: ""It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat.  He added: ""Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No - if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.""  The 51-year-old had recommended Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman, to head the party until the leadership challenge was complete.  Suzanne Evans said she was ""very pleased"" Mr Farage had agreed to remain leader.  In a tweet, she wrote: ""Very pleased @Nigel_Farage still at the helm. As stated previously, I tried to persuade him to stay and was never actually appointed leader!"""
571,"When Mel Gibson announced plans to direct The Passion in Latin and Aramaic - with no subtitles - we thought he'd gone mad. Thankfully, he conceded on the latter point, but the words were always peripheral to ""powerful, brutal"" images of the crucifixion of Christ (Jim Caviezel). The film still caused controversy, but that was inevitable and perhaps even helped it to become a worldwide blockbuster. Three years later, there is a second coming on this Director's Edition DVD.  A revised edition of the film doesn't veer too much from the theatrical cut - both are equally bloody and unrelenting. Two deleted scenes highlight moments from the public trial and condemnation of Jesus and later, as he is led battered and bleeding to his death, a gallant address to the mourning crowd. It's not the additional footage, but the Making Of documentary that forms the centrepiece of this two-disc DVD. It's a painstaking exploration in 21 parts and Gibson begins by talking about his approach to the story as ""a personal meditation"" on the crucifixion of Christ. Later, screenwriter Benedict Fitzgerald and theological consultant father William J Fulco get into the nitty-gritty of adapting the ancient scriptures. Initially, both men were resistant to the idea of using Aramaic and, as it turns out, the dialogue is only an approximation of the language Jesus spoke.  Make-up and effects are major concerns for the production phase and Caviezel admits to spending lots of time in the gym just to be able to bear the weight of a 100-pound crucifix. Gruesome close-ups of the violence, like his hand being nailed into the wooden cross, required an intricate blend of makeup, prosthetics and digital effects. In a separate panel discussion, the key crew members talk more about the challenges of achieving the brutal level of realism Gibson wanted. A fresh take on sound and score is also explained in terms of breaking free of the traditional template for biblical epics. A wide choice of commentaries offers a scene-by-scene analysis of their work in music and visuals.  Gibson's film is placed in a wider context in a series of featurettes looking at religious art and storytelling through the ages. Experts agree that ""religion and art are parallel ventures"" in getting across grand ideas and making them relatable. Cameras follow pilgrims as they retrace the final journey of Jesus, historians explain the symbolism of crucifixion in ancient cultures and there's also an investigation into the apostles and their role in cementing the Christian faith. William J Fulco elaborates on these matters in his commentary for the film as well as pointing out where the script takes liberties with the original texts.  Gibson joins his cinematographer and editor for the main commentary (actually recorded for the original cut of the film). There's a lot of talk about the structure of the film and the use of flashback, not only to elucidate the final journey of Christ, but also as a way of alleviating moments of extreme violence. And in case you thought Gibson was taking himself too seriously, there's a lot of wisecracking too. There could even be a hint of bitter irony when he notes a resemblance between one of the Roman guards and Rupert Murdoch - the man who distributed his film, but initially wouldn't give him the money to make it. Incidentally, the unorthodox approach to marketing and distribution is also scrutinised in that sprawling Making Of section. There's hardly a stone unturned.  Passion Of The Christ Special Edition DVD is released on Monday 26th March 2007."
572,"About one million people died in the famine in the 1840s and 50s The killer mould behind potato blight has a giant genome, say scientists. Potato blight was a major cause of the mid-19th Century Irish famine, when starvation killed a million people and drove a million more to emigrate. The water mould Phytophthora infestans still destroys crops worldwide worth $6bn each year. In 2003 it wiped out the entire crop of Papua New Guinea. Scientists hope the genome, published in the journal Nature, will help in developing new defences to the blight. The mould thrives in cool, wet weather and can infect potatoes and tomatoes, causing a ""late blight"" that can destroy entire fields in just a few days. The problem appears to be getting worse as the organism continues to evolve. We will aim to breed a potato that is more durable; but don't bet against the pathogen    Potato farmers have to spray chemicals each week to keep the mould at bay, but even then it can come back with a vengeance. In recent years, growers in the UK have been forced to increase chemical spraying by up to 30%. In Ireland, farmers have described this season as the worst in living memory. How the mould adapts so rapidly and becomes resistant to chemical attack has long puzzled scientists. ""This pathogen has an exquisite ability to adapt and change, and that's what makes it so dangerous"", said Dr Chad Nusbaum, a lead scientist on the project from the Broad Institute in Cambridge, US. The international scientific team mapped the genome of the mould, and found it contained at least twice as much DNA as its relatives. The genome is a mixture of gene-dense regions and much bigger gene-light regions. The mould can insert itself into the leaves of potato plants The scientists found 700 key genes in the gene-light regions. Some of them are known to help the mould attack the immune systems of potatoes. Brian Haas, co-lead author of the study, said: ""The regions change rapidly over time, acting as a kind of incubator to enable the rapid birth and death of genes that are key to plant infection. ""As a result, these critical genes may be gained and lost so rapidly that the hosts simply can't keep up."" Paul Birch from the Scottish Crop Research Institute, another of the scientists involved, said that modern farming techniques were part of the problem. He said: ""There is a real epidemic in Europe. ""In the EU we grow certain types of potato for mass production, forcing natural selection. ""But the Maris Piper that you find in Sainsbury's or Tesco has certain traits that people want."" It is hoped that the information will help researchers devise new ways of protecting crops. However, one of the researchers doubted that the potato could win its arms race against the old enemy. ""We now know our enemy and may find an Achilles' heel,"" said Sophien Kamoun from the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, UK. ""We will aim to breed a potato that is more durable; but don't bet against the pathogen,"" he told BBC News. Douglas Kell, chief executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), said: ""I am delighted that several UK and BBSRC-funded institutes and laboratories have been able to participate in the experiments leading to this important milestone."" Professors Kamoun and Birch were speaking at a presentation of the genome at the British Science Festival.     "
573,"For many people, there's nothing new about laughing at Lembit Opik.  This is, after all, the MP who wanted public funds to hunt planet-destroying asteroids. The man whose, shall we say, complicated personal life got him many more headlines than his Commons speeches ever did. The only difference this time was that he actually wanted us to laugh.  Was it really so surprising that the former MP for Montgomeryshire might see a future career in comedy? He seemed to take a cab straight from his election night declaration to the Have I Got News For You studio.  The venue for his stand-up debut was the Backstage Comedy Club, a modest-sized L-shaped venue near the theatres and cinemas of London's West End.  The organisers suddenly found themselves setting up photocalls, while politely declining requests from TV crews - The One Show were already in, any more cameramen, and there would be little room for paying punters.  The size of the audience was not lost on comedy's newest star: ""I'm launching my new career six feet under, in the comedy equivalent of an overcrowded coffin.""  In many ways, it's not that different from a maiden speech in the Commons. A nervous newcomer takes the stage in front of a crowd teetering on outright hostility.  Among that crowd, a handful of Lembit's former political colleagues, including Labour MP Stephen Pound, who proved to be the most vocal of the night's hecklers.  The audience had been nicely warmed for his debut, with a couple of very good acts. And when Lembit took to the stage (I say stage, I mean slightly raised platform) he certainly looked nervous.  Actually, he looked like he was canvassing, in a suit and tie, complete with Lib Dem rosette.  An early gag, about Nick Clegg ignoring him in a lift, belied the rather bitter truth about his new status.  ""I'm earning a hundred quid for this,"" he told the 70-strong crowd, though claimed the associated costs meant it was actually costing him £37 to perform.  There were many people to thank - the comedy promoters, his political team, and of course the voters of Montgomeryshire, without whose waning enthusiasm he wouldn't be contemplating a career change.  And it's clear that, in many ways, Lembit's heart is still in Westminster, less than a mile from the comedy basement in which he stood.  His name, he reminded us, is almost an anagram of ""I like to be MP"". His promoter had said it would be a good night if he wasn't bottled off the stage. A modest aspiration.  Did he manage it? He didn't hang around to find out. Within five seconds of saying his goodbyes he was out of the door. The woman next to me described his set as ""not fantastic, but not completely awful"".  His brief ventriloquism with a shoe, cunningly titled ""Mr Shoe"", wasn't really comedy gold. But then much truly golden comedy is rooted in misfortune. Lembit should do alright then."
574,"A bomb has exploded at a north London postal sorting office. It is the second such attack in three weeks and has been linked to the Real IRA. A bomb has exploded at a north London postal sorting office. It is the second such attack in three weeks and has been linked to the Real IRA. One passer-by - a man in his 20s - was slightly injured in the explosion in Hendon at 0153 BST. After the attack, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, told reporters dissident republicans from Northern Ireland may be planning a bombing campaign ahead of the general election. We will be doing everything possible to secure the safety of those taking part in the election and the general public   Mr Fry said police had contingency plans for dealing with the ""major challenge"" of a terror campaign ahead of the election, which is expected to be called within days. ""We have seen sustained activity in election campaigns both in '97 and '92,"" he said. ""We take note of that and we will be doing everything possible to secure the safety of those taking part in the election and the general public."" A spokesman for Scotland Yard said no warning was given ahead of the latest blast and no-one has admitted carrying out the attack. But Mr Fry said: ""The most likely dissident group to be responsible was the Real IRA in view of their on-going terror campaign in Northern Ireland and London."" Last month, a device exploded on the steps of the Hendon sorting office but no-one was hurt. In the past year the capital has been hit by several bombings blamed on the terrorist group. These include the bombing of BBC Television Centre, a rocket attack on MI6's headquarters and an explosion on Hammersmith Bridge.     Dissident republicans opposed to the IRA ceasefire known as the Real IRA had been carrying out attacks in Northern Ireland and England since 1998, starting with the Omagh bombing that killed 29 people in August of that year. On 4 March 2001 a massive bomb exploded outside BBC Television Centre in London. A month later Hendon post office was bombed. Three months after the second blast, there was another attack in London - this time in Ealing Broadway shopping centre injuring seven people. In November 2001 a bomb went off in Birmingham city centre but no-one was hurt. In April 2003, five men - Noel Maguire, Aiden Hulme, James McCormack, John Hannan and Robert Hulme - were jailed for between 16 and 22 years for carrying out the BBC, Ealing and Birmingham bombings.

575,"However, David Elliot insisted that, while the situation had deteriorated, he has not given up on the club.  Just 10 players have indicated that they are willing to face Aberdeen on Saturday as doubts surface over insurance and future payment.  ""As of today, we don't have a team for Saturday,"" said Elliot.  ""I can't insist that the players play if they haven't been paid and I can't pay them on Monday either.  ""Failure to play on Saturday would mean we are in breach of league rules and would leave us open to be fined and face other penalties.  ""Unfortunately we are running out of time.""  Aberdeen have announced that they expect the game to go ahead.  ""Following intensive discussions involving the SPL, the administrator and ourselves, we were told that the governing body expects the match to be played, as scheduled, on Saturday at 3pm,"" said a Dons spokesman.  ""While these are clearly difficult times for all concerned, the clear priority for everyone connected with the SPL has been to ensure we do all we possibly can to assist in ensuring Gretna fulfils its fixture commitments.""  If Gretna can keep going beyond the weekend they could then pin their hopes on a big pay-day at home to Celtic the following weekend.  Elliot also aims to renegotiate the terms of the ground-sharing agreement with Motherwell and said the Fir Park club had been helpful.  Any additional breathing space would also give more time to attract any potential investors.  The SPL will meet with Elliot on Friday to discuss a possible advance payment of a ""six-figure sum"" that clubs usually receive at the end of each season from the league's broadcasting and advertising contracts.  ""If we receive reassurances from Gretna that they will be able to fulfil their fixtures then the money would be available,"" said an SPL spokesman.  Earlier, football consultant Paul Davies told BBC Sport he was fronting ""a serious bid"" for the club.  But Elliot said that, while he was aware of ""two or three interested parties"", nobody was presently looking at the club's accounts.  To make matters worse at the beleaguered club, their Raydale Park home was the subject of an overnight break-in, with football boots and food stolen.  The Inland Revenue had been pursuing a £350,000 debt.  Two former managers are seeking payments of £800,000 and £100,000, while the club are in arrears with ground-sharing payments to Motherwell.  While Gretna are not saddled with enormous debts, backer Brooks Mileson has withdrawn his financial support after a bout of illness.  ""There is no direct contact between Mr Mileson and myself or anyone else at the club but Mr Mileson's position has not changed; he is not putting forward funds for the club to continue,"" said Elliot.  ""He has put in a very substantial amount of money - I believe it to be around £8m - and the way the club has continued with great success over recent seasons is that each week he has been funding the losses.  ""As administrator I am faced with the task of reversing that situation to allow the club to continue.""  Gretna have been docked 10 points for going into administration.  The revised points tally for the league's bottom club is just six and relegation is almost certain, with 11th-placed St Mirren 21 points better off.  Gretna reduced their squad in January, selling, loaning out and releasing a number players, while bringing in a host of youngsters on loan from England.  Only eight of the 17 senior players remaining on the books at Gretna have deals that run beyond the end of this season.  But all contracts have been breached by the non-payment of wages and players would be within their rights to seek new clubs right away.  ""I can't stand in their way - morally, ethically or legally,"" said Elliot.  Gretna were admitted to the senior ranks of Scottish football in 2002, taking advantage of the demise of Airdrieonians.  And, with Mileson's backing, the club rapidly rose through the divisions, culminating with last year's promotion to the top flight.  Should Gretna go out of business, there would be no relegation from the SPL, while it is likely that all the points from the games they were involved in would be withdrawn."
576,"Four men have been charged following the ""ferocious"" violence after Thursday's Millwall game, in which 47 officers were injured.  The trouble, involving between 600 and 900 Millwall fans, followed the club's bitter Division One play-off defeat by Birmingham City.  Police are considering suing the south London football club for damages after the ""vicious"" violence in which they came under a barrage of missiles for more than an hour.  However, club chairman Theo Paphitis said Millwall itself could not be blamed for the actions of a ""mindless minority"".  ""Where incidents occur away from the Den we do of course feel a moral responsibility,"" Mr Paphitis said.  ""But the problem of mob violence is not solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, it is a problem which plagues the whole of our society.""  Three of the men have been charged with public order offences.  They are: James Gavin Mullen, 19, of St Francis Avenue, Gravesend in Kent; Mark Bellchambers, 21, of Bradley Road, Enfield, north London, and John Cornelius Parker, 18, of Beldan Hall, Hallstead in Kent.  Mr Mullen and Mr Parker were bailed to appear before Greenwich magistrates on Wednesday, while Mr Bellchambers was bailed to re-appear at an east London police station at a date to be fixed.  Police also said Nigel Simon Haywood, 22, of Corser Street, Dudley, West Midlands was charged with breach of a banning order. He appeared before Greenwich magistrates on Friday.  A 25-year-old man and a 22-year-old man arrested outside the ground were warned for drunkenness, and a 40-year-old man was released with no further action, police said.  During the hour of violence crowds threw missiles, including bricks, paving stones, a chisel, flares and fireworks at police. Two cars were set alight.  Chief Superintendent Mike Humphrey said: ""This is my seventh season as commander for Millwall and this is the worst yet.""  A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said out of 36 mounted police officers, 24 were injured, and so were 24 horses.  She said one whole 21-strong unit of riot police was injured.  Nine of the injured were treated in hospital for injuries including a broken leg, arm and foot.  Sergeant Russell Lamb said the situation was ""like a battlefield"" and the most frightening he had been in.  ""I have done the poll tax and May Day riots and Wapping in the 1980s and I am in no doubt that it was one of the most unbelievable and violent situations I have been in.""  Millwall president Reg Burr vowed that any troublemakers would get a lifetime ban.  ""We will do anything we can to identify any troublemakers and the appropriate action will be taken - we will ban them for life,"" he said.  Police warned they had video footage of the disturbances and expected to make a significant number of arrests.  They said some of the violence must have been premeditated, as weapons had been stashed away ahead of the match."
577,"The United Nations chief refugee official, Sadako Ogata, has expressed doubts that Serb refugees from Kosovo will be able to return to their homes soon.  Mrs Ogata was speaking during a tour of Serbia, where she visited collective centres for Serb refugees from Kosovo and Croatia.  Serbia hosts the largest refugee population in Europe, with more than 700,000 refugees from the wars in the former Yugoslavia.  Mrs Ogata gave a stark assessment of the position of Serbs in Kosovo. The security situation in the province, she said, was not one in which the UN refugee agency could promote returns.  She said there were still people fleeing.  Her remarks are the latest acknowledgement by the international community of its failure to reassure and protect Serbs and other ethnic minorities."
578,"Throughout early July, the company planned to display the device to the public for the first time.  Professor Sir Eric Ash, electrical engineer and former rector of Imperial College London, visited the demonstration for the BBC News website.  As an engineer, whenever I look at a new baby I say categorically that there can be no such thing - it's far too complicated to work.  Yet we know this lack of faith in the marvellous is misplaced.  So, the fact that a device or an invention looks too marvellous to be true is not conclusive evidence that it isn't.  I believe that it is thinking on such lines that encourages inventors - and there have been many since the 12th Century - to pursue what would be a true marvel: a perpetual motion machine.  The most recent attempt is from Mr Sean McCarthy, the Chief Executive Officer of an Irish company called Steorn.  His invention, known as the ""Orbo"", is a mechanical device which uses powerful magnets on the rim of a rotor and further magnets on an outer shell.  Mr McCarthy is convinced that it is working. He took a full page advertisement in the Economist last year to say so, and to attract volunteer scientists to check the authenticity of his claims.  They are still in the process of doing so.  In the meantime Mr McCarthy was hoping to demonstrate the machine to the public at the London Kinetica Museum, which is devoted to displaying dynamic art, particularly of artefacts at the interface of science and art.  The demonstration was to run over 10 days starting on 6 July. Unfortunately, there was a technical defect, attributed by Mr McCarthy to the excessive heat produced by lights used to illuminate the device so that cameras could stream pictures of it in action across the web.  He hopes to be able to demonstrate the machine at a later date.  Mr McCarthy appreciates that if the device really works it is in contradiction of the law of conservation of energy, which he sees as a dogma of science.  There is an implied reference to religious dogmas, and it is just here that one can see the source of the misunderstanding.  A person who is an adherent of that religion may not necessarily believe each and every one of the dogmas. Beliefs cannot of course be chosen a la carte - but there is a degree of flexibility which can accommodate quite significant differences.  The law of conservation of energy is not like this.  It states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant, although it may change forms, into heat or kinetic energy for example.  In short, law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.  Denying its validity would undermine not just little bits of science - the whole edifice would be no more. All of the technology on which we built the modern world would lie in ruins.  There is no flexibility in the acceptance of the law as true - at all times, and in all circumstances.  It is the failure to appreciate the difference between this scientific law and a law of religion or of society which is why we know - without having to examine details of a particular device - that Orbo cannot work.  So, last Friday a number of people turned up at the museum and were told that the demonstration would have to be postponed, indefinitely.  I was fortunate, however, in that Mr McCarthy kindly agreed to see me.  He is a very friendly person aged just over 40, trained originally as a mechanical engineer.  He has also worked in software engineering and on control systems for the oil industry.  He came across his invention by chance whilst developing an independent power system for CCTV cameras. The company, founded in 2000 and supported privately, is now wholly devoted to developing Orbo.  When asked about the conservation of energy Mr McCarthy says quite frankly that he does not know where the energy that provides perpetual motion comes from. He wonders whether he is somehow harnessing so-called ""zero point"" energy, a type of residual energy found in a system and first proposed by Einstein.  Zero point energy is the lowest possible energy a system can have and therefore cannot be removed.  He also points out that cosmologists believe in the presence of dark matter and dark energy. Might they somehow help his cause?  I believe that Mr McCarthy is truly convinced of the validity of his invention. It is, in my view, a case of prolonged self deception.  I ended our conversation by giving totally unsolicited advice: to drop Orbo and get back to software engineering.  It would not have been unreasonable had he then grabbed me by the collar and thrown me out of the window. He did none of these things and was totally genial.  Might I have convinced him?

579,"Twelve people have been killed and 25 injured by a gunman who opened fire in west Cumbria.  A body thought to be that of the suspect - taxi driver Derrick Bird - has been found in the Boot area.  The first fatality was in Whitehaven before the gunman drove south, apparently shooting people at random.  Witnesses said the suspect drove through the town with a gun hanging out of his car window, before heading south through Gosforth and Seascale.  A GP in the town of Seascale said he and a colleague had later certified two other people dead.  Dr Barrie Walker said: ""The surgery was called and I went out. I've certified one of them dead. My colleague saw another,"" he said.  ""At present there are two people dead and one seriously injured in Seascale. I know one of the victims. She was in the street.  ""The second person was on a bicycle and was shot on the bike.""  BBC Look North Chief Reporter Chris Stewart said a farmer is also believed to have been killed in the Gosforth area.  After the shootings, detectives said 52-year-old Mr Bird drove to the central Lakes in a Citroen Picasso, then abandoned it in the Boot area.  Before the body was discovered people living nearby were urged to stay indoors for their own protection.  Helicopters and armed officers from other police forces were brought in to help apprehend the gunman.  Soon afterwards, Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Hyde said: ""I can confirm that we've found a body in a wooded area near Boot which we believe to be Mr Bird, together with a firearm.  ""A formal identification will be made later.""  Mr Hyde added: ""Our focus now is to try and work out what has caused this and where Mr Bird has been over the last 24 hours and in particular the last few hours.  ""I would plead to anyone who has seen him or has seen any of the incidents, please come forward, speak to us and help us piece together exactly was has happened in this very, very tragic set of circumstances.  ""We have a number of crime scenes across the county, which are being staffed by police officers, and I would ask people to show a little bit of restraint and respect in regard to those scenes as we try and piece together exactly what has gone on.""  AT THE SCENE IN WHITEHAVEN A man's body was lying behind a taxi rank in a cordoned-off street, covered by some sort of blanket. People were being kept away by police but witnesses I spoke to said they had heard two shots at around 1040 BST. Passers-by in Whitehaven were also talking about other incidents they had heard of so I quickly realised that this wasn't limited to one shooting. Within the space of less than four hours it became clear that the gunman had gone on a shooting rampage. I heard of a cyclist being shot in Seascale and someone else being killed near Egremont. The police began giving briefings in Whitehaven and told us a body had been found in woods near the village of Boot and they believed the incident was now over. But they went on to say they still didn't know how many had been killed or injured.  A major incident has been declared at West Cumberland Hospital, in Whitehaven, where the NHS said all routine operations had been cancelled.  The Accident and Emergency department at the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle is also on full incident stand-by, the hospital trust said.  The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in west Cumbria closed its gates as a safety precaution and afternoon shift workers were being told to stay away, though the site has since reopened.  The Whitehaven victim, believed to be a colleague of 52-year-old Mr Bird, was killed at 1035 BST.  A local taxi firm boss, Glenda Pears, said: ""We just don't know what's happened.  ""The lad that's been killed was friends with him. They used to stand together having a craic on the rank.  ""He was friends with everybody and used to stand and joke on Duke Street.""  Sue Matthews, a telephonist at A2B Taxis in Whitehaven, said the Mr Bird was self-employed and lived alone. She described him as a ""quiet fellow"".  At the start of Prime Minister's Questions David Cameron expressed his shock at the events which had unfolded.  He said: ""The government will do everything it possibly can to help the local community and those affected.  ""When lives and communities are suddenly shattered in this way, our thoughts should be with all those caught up with these tragic events.""  An emergency helpline has been opened for people concerned about the incident. Cumbria Police Casualty Bureau Line on 0800 096 0095."
580,"Former Leeds United and Stoke City star Chris Kamara has turned out for a struggling mid Wales side after they were mocked on Sky Sports.  Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling ribbed Welshpool Town when they lost to local rivals Waterloo Rovers 10-1.  But manager David Jones emailed the show explaining how the club nearly folded, and Sky made amends by arranging for Kamara to play for them.  Sadly, he did not have much of an impact as Welshpool lost 6-1.  The channel's cameras filmed the game against Rhayader, which kicked off at 14:00 GMT.  About 500 fans turned up to see the ex-pro in action, 10 times the attendance the club has been attracting of late.  The temporary new signing played a full 90 minutes in midfield for the Spar Mid Wales League outfit.  Kamara announced his comeback on Twitter before the match, saying: ""After 17 years retirement I am back, move over Scholes & Henry.""  He said he was playing for Welshpool Town, adding ""[I] must be mad"".  Welshpool manager David Jones said: ""Chris played really well. He's still very fit.""  Town were 2-0 down at half-time, but scored just after the break to put themselves back in the game.  ""He gave us a team talk before the game and at half-time and he was talking to the lads throughout the match,"" added Jones.  ""We got back into it early in the second half, but Rhayader ran away with it in the end.  ""Chris said he enjoyed it, but there are no plans for him to play again for us.""  Kamara, 54, who played in defence and midfield during a 20-year playing career, made his league debut in 1975 for Portsmouth.  He went on to play for Swindon, Brentford, Stoke City, Leeds, Luton Town, Sheffield United, Middlesbrough and Bradford City.  He went into management briefly following his retirement from the game in 1995, before becoming a pitch-side reporter for Sky Sports.  He has since become well-known for his catchphrase: ""Unbelievable Jeff"".  Known as the Lilywhites, Welshpool are languishing near the foot of table, with eight points from 21 games.  Two years ago they were in the Welsh Premier League and in 2007 just missed out on qualification for the Uefa Cup.  But since then the club, which was founded 133 years ago and is one of Wales' oldest, has fallen on hard times, and had no players or a manager in August.  The Boxing Day hammering by Waterloo Rovers was the lowest point of the season so far. It was picked up by Stelling, who quipped that Welshpool had met their Waterloo.  Unfortunately, the crushing 10-1 defeat was followed by a 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Llansanffraid Village on New Year's Eve, which Stelling then mentioned on the show.  Sky Sports contacted Jones and said it was sending a camera to one of the club's matches and a former football star would play for them.  Kamara has had to sign for Welshpool until the end of the season, and because his last club was in England he needed international clearance from the Football Association of Wales to play."
581,"A new police station has opened in north Kent at a cost of £30m.  The new building at Thamesway, near Northfleet, means Dartford and Gravesend stations will be closed.  It features a 40-cell custody suite, a vulnerable witness interview room, and a garage where cars can be tested by forensic scientists.  The station, built using the private finance initiative, is heated by a geothermal system which reuses rainwater.  Mark Gilmartin, of Kent Police Authority, said: ""The old police stations were no longer fit for purpose and now we have an environmentally friendly station with fantastic equipment."""
582,"It is 17 years since a gang of armed, masked robbers burst into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport one November night, beat up and poured petrol over the security guards, and made off with the goods they were guarding.  It was a South London gang at work, but it was no ordinary London robbery.  The property under guard was gold. Three tons of gold: 6,800 bars of it, packed into 76 cardboard boxes. And two boxes of diamonds.  And some of the stolen goods ended up in Kenneth Noye's hands - he was jailed for 14 years for his crime.  The six-strong gang had planned the raid with meticulous care and got away with the biggest haul in British criminal history.  Years later, the vast bulk of the bullion remains unrecovered. Some gold was melted down by a businessman near Bath. Some simply vanished into a criminal underworld and reappeared in foreign bank accounts in Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, Miami and the Bahamas. In one short period, £3m cash was withdrawn from a bank in Bristol, requiring the Bank of England to supply so many notes that even the Treasury had to be informed. And the gang - even those eventually jailed - is believed to have become wealthy. Some, like Kenneth Noye, lived off the proceeds in luxury homes in the UK and the Costa del Sol.  After escaping from Heathrow with their haul, the robbers needed help to turn the gold into clean cash. They called upon criminals with specialist knowledge, and that was where Kenneth Noye came in. He was an expert in his field, and paid such attention to detail that he even mixed some of the gold with copper coins to change its purity and disguise its origins. Some men who had played a part in the raid were eventually brought to justice. Micky McAvoy and Brian Robinson were both jailed for 25 years. A third man, Anthony White was cleared because of a lack of evidence. But within a short time White, a benefit claimant who lived in a council house, had spent more than £400,000 buying and restoring homes in London and Kent. And in Spain police found £115,000 in cash and jewellery worth £100,000.  White was finally jailed for 11 years in 1997 for his part in a massive drug-smuggling ring. Also cleared of involvement was a businessman friend of Kenneth Noye, who admitted melting down gold bars from the raid but insisted he did not know where they had come from. Noye was jailed for helping launder the proceeds, but not before he had stabbed to death an undercover detective, John Fordham, who was staking out his Kent home in the search for evidence. However Noye was cleared of the murder after he pleaded self-defence. So a handful of men were jailed, but police think up to 15 people took part in planning and executing the robbery. They believe they know their names, and some of the bank accounts they opened in tax havens in Jersey and elsewhere. Despite dogged police work spanning nearly two decades, it it seems most of those involved have simply got away with it - and most of the gold will never be recovered. But some believe it is closer at hand. It is claimed in some quarters that anyone wearing gold jewellery bought in the UK after 1983, is probably wearing Brinks Mat."
583,"The petition, which is the most popular on the Downing Street website, calls for the scrapping of ""planned vehicle tracking and road pricing policy"".  But No 10 has insisted that doing nothing would lead to a 25% increase in congestion ""in less than a decade"".  The petition was posted by Peter Roberts, from Telford, Shropshire, who said it was an ""unfair tax"".  Mr Roberts - whose petition broke through the million signature-barrier by 1045 GMT on Saturday - believes charging is unfair on poor people and those who live apart from their families.  He said the numbers signing his petition were ""unprecedented"".  ""There certainly hasn't been an electronic petition that has been this successful. I think it is one of the biggest petitions in history.""  He said the only way road pricing could work would be if people were constantly monitored.  ""That is an invasion of your privacy and I think it is a very sad day when a democratic government wants to track your movements.  ""It is time for the government to listen to the people rather than dictate to the people.""  The next-most popular transport petition on the Downing Street website has little more than 5,000 signatures.  The petitioner has been a member of the Association of British Drivers (ABD) since 2001.  The ABD, which is calling for a referendum on the issue, has been running a campaign to encourage people to sign but insisted Mr Roberts acted as an individual.  The Department for Transport is planning regional trials of road pricing.  The ABD's Nigel Humphries said the government ""ought to reconsider their whole position, they ought to scrap the whole idea of road-pricing and actually go back to working out what transport people need"".  Plans to introduce a nationwide ""pay-as-you-drive"" system were unveiled by former Transport Secretary Alistair Darling in 2005.  Mr Darling's successor, Douglas Alexander, has since suggested that road pricing could be brought in within a decade.  He said the scale of the response to the petition showed more debate was needed on congestion charging for motorists.  ""The response to this petition makes the case for more debate, not less, on the issue of road pricing,"" he told the Times.  ""It makes me more determined to debate the real issues about how we tackle growing congestion.  ""I understand there are strong feelings on this issue but strong feelings alone are no substitute for considering how we tackle the challenge of congestion.""  According to Edmund King of the RAC Foundation, the government needed to rethink its strategy.  ""They need to be setting up a scheme overseen by an independent body, they need to guarantee that there will be other tax reductions on fuel tax or vehicle excise duty and they need to guarantee that the road network will be improved,"" he said.  Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Alistair Carmichael said the petition ""misrepresents the case for road user pricing"".  But he said it showed the government needed to be open with people about their plans.  ""If the public feels that road user pricing is just another cash cow for the Treasury, then it will meet stiff resistance, and a real opportunity to reduce congestion will be missed,"" he said."
584,"The Philippines Catholic Church has apologised for sexual abuse by hundreds of its priests over the last 20 years.  The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines said on Monday that it was now drafting guidelines on how to deal with such offences by its clergy.  When sexual scandals involving Catholic priests in the US came to light earlier this year, the Philippines media began reporting on abuses by local priests.  Monday's statement was the first official response from the Church in the Philippines, where at least 85% of the 76 million-strong population is Catholic.  According to the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Orlando Quevedo, about 200 of the country's 7,000 priests may have committed ""sexual misconduct"" - including child abuse, homosexuality and affairs - over the past two decades.  ""To the various crises in society, we must now, with great sorrow and shame, add problems in the Church"", said a statement by the bishops read to a news conference on Monday.  ""Sexual misconduct on the part of shepherds of the flock betrays the holy priesthood that Christ has shared.""  A protocol is being drafted by the bishops on dealing with sexual abuse cases. The guidelines will include encouraging victims of assaults to file criminal charges, said the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference.  The Philippines is one of several Asian countries which have been wracked by sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church in the past few months.  Bishops in Australia and New Zealand have apologised to dozens of victims of sexual abuse carried out by priests and police are investigating several priests in Hong Kong for alleged indecent assault."
585,"Suicides in South Korea have more than doubled in 10 years, according to new figures from the government.  South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world and pressure has been growing for the government to do more to stop the problem spiralling.  The new figures show that in 2009 more than 40 people killed themselves each day in South Korea.  This is more than twice the number who did so a decade earlier and five times as many as in 1989.  The question is why more South Koreans are killing themselves?  The economy has been growing by an average of 7% since the Asian crisis a decade ago and despite a rapid rise in household debts, the country has not seen the mass lay-offs and economic stagnation which were blamed for suicide rates in neighbouring Japan.  Some analysts here say there has been a move towards suicides among younger age groups, with some young people using internet sites to form suicide groups.  Earlier this year the South Korean parliament passed a new law giving the government more responsibility for preventing suicides.  Since then several new initiatives have been launched including the installation of emergency phones on bridges and, according to local media, plans for a nationwide series of suicide prevention centres."
586,"Many workers have been killed - many more than the official death toll of 14, a Greek union representative said.  But, he told the programme, no official numbers are being kept.  The BBC team observed workers - many from Eastern Europe and South Asia - operating without protective equipment and with minimal supervision.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Face the Facts programme, Greek Olympic Committee President Lampis Nikolaou admitted that the death toll in Athens was far greater than in any other city to have recently hosted the games.  ""The human price is very high for me,"" Mr Nikolaou said.  ""This is something that I regret very much but in every country, in every workplace, accidents happen and people die.""  The BBC team visited some of the 39 new sites still under construction for the Olympics with British health and safety expert Tom Mellish.  With widespread evidence of poor safety standards, no protective clothing, and little or no apparent organisation, such sites would be closed down in the UK, he said.  ""You get down to some of the detail then you get some real howlers for health and safety.""  Mr Mellish said that in his view, the Athens experience raised questions for the International Olympic Committee about which countries were truly suitable to host the games in future.  Tackled by Face the Facts presenter John Waite, the general secretary for the Olympic Games, Spyros Capralos, admitted he had no idea how many workers have died constructing the games.  ""We have accidents in the streets, we have accidents everywhere on a daily basis and we don't talk about this.  ""But we have taken all the necessary measures (so) that we don't have any accidents in the preparation of these Olympic Games.""  ""We have managed to do a lot in a very short period of time and I don't know other statistics for other countries... but I think that we have first-class facilities, well-built and I think that overall the result is a good result.""  Eventually Mr Capralos became so exasperated by the line of questioning that he called the interview to a halt and walked away.  The general secretary of the Greek Construction Workers' Union, George Theodorou, told the programme he had collected names and details of 14 workers who had died on Olympic facilities.  ""Men are being forced to work long shifts, up to 14 hours a day every day, in very hot temperatures and under constant pressure to complete construction work in time for the Olympics,"" he said.  ""Most have no hard hats or safety boots and if they complain, they're sacked. ""  Greek opposition MP Liana Kanelli told the BBC that the problems arose because although Greece had seven years to prepare for the games, more than half of that time was taken up by legal battles.  ""There wasn't a brick laid for the first three-and-a-half years. We've now got about one injury or one death every couple of days.  ""This is a Greek tragedy that we will have to face after the Olympics."""
587,"More than 25 people have been killed during a vicious gun battle in Mexico City just days before the Olympic Games are due to begin.  Thousands of students had gathered for a meeting organised by the National Strike Council in La Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco to protest against the military occupation of the National Polytechnic Institute.  The protesters, many of whom were women and children, had been planning to march through a working-class suburb of the city, but by early evening military personnel in armoured vehicles had surrounded the square.  The Mexican government say ""agitator groups"" among the students began shooting at the crowds from buildings, which resulted in a 90-minute gun fight.  General Marcelino Garcia Barragan, Mexico's defence minister said the army began firing into the crowd in self-defence after they found themselves targets of sniper fire from buildings in the square.  But several eye-witnesses claim the army entered the square in seven or eight armoured tanks and began shooting first.  After the fighting had subsided dozens of bodies lay strewn across the square, many more were injured.  More than 500 people have been arrested.  The violence follows weeks of demonstrations by students demanding democratic reform and social justice. They have used the international focus on Mexico City because of the Olympics to promote their message.  In September, President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, in a bid to suppress the protests and cause minimum disruption to the Olympics, ordered the military occupation of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City.  At this stage it is not clear whether the 7,000 athletes, currently preparing for the Games 11 miles away from Tlatelolco in the Olympic Village, are in danger. It is the first time the Olympics have been held in a Latin American country.  Lord Exeter, British vice-president of the International Olympic Committee told the Times: ""The riots have nothing to do with the Olympic Games. The students are not protesting against the games but against the Mexican government."""
588,"""We have found the secret of life,"" his collaborator and subsequent fellow Nobel laureate James Watson later quoted him as saying.  The pair really had figured out something very close to that.  Working out the famous double helix structure of DNA was an achievement which led to countless advances and solved a mystery which had troubled scientists for decades.  ""When we saw the answer we had to pinch ourselves,"" Watson told the BBC in an anniversary interview. ""Could it really be this pretty? When we went to lunch [at the Eagle] we realised it probably was true because it was so pretty.""  During World War II, researchers had shown that the mysterious substance which carries genes from generation to generation was DNA.  Before Watson and Crick made their breakthrough, scientists knew that the DNA molecule was made of a few relatively simple chemicals.  They had the recipe for DNA, but no-one was sure how these simple chemicals combined to carry the huge amount of information required to recreate a living thing.  Instead of carrying out experiments, Watson and Crick set out to think their way out of the problem.  Other researchers had come up with possible models of the structure of DNA, but they were flawed.  Watson and Crick came up with their own after calculating what they thought it should look like.  They could not be sure about their model, though, until they had a stroke of luck.  A team at King's College in London had for several years been doing experiments using the relatively new technique of X-ray crystallography.  One of them, Rosalind Franklin, had taken a now famous image of the X-ray diffraction pattern from crystalline DNA showing a clear cross shape.  Franklin's colleague, Maurice Wilkins, let Watson see the image during a visit to London but did not tell her.  Watson and Crick had already worked out what the X-ray photo of DNA should look like if their model was correct. When Watson saw Franklin's image, he knew that he and Crick were right.  And so to 28 February 1953. ""The discovery was made on that day, not slowly over the course of the week,"" James Watson said.  ""It was simple; instantly you could explain this idea to anyone - you didn't have to be a high powered scientist to see how the genetic material was copied.""  The pair published their famous paper in Nature on 25 April that year, revealing to the world the double helix and hinting how the fact that DNA has two strands allows it to create identical copies of itself.  The idea took a while to attract attention, but over the decades that have since passed it became the basis for many of the famous achievements of modern biology and medicine.  Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared a Nobel Prize for their work, but Franklin died in her 30s of cancer, still unaware of the decisive role of her image.  Watson said she would probably have got to the structure herself if he and Crick had not got there in the February.  ""If Rosalind had continued to think about DNA - she was giving it up - [she could have found the answer].  ""Unknown to us at just about the time we found it, she had concluded that [DNA] was a two-chain helix. But she hadn't thought of how you would put the bases in the centre. But it would have been hard for her not to ask how you put the bases in the centre.""  Watson went on to be closely involved with the Human Genome Project, which set out to decipher the meaning of the billions of units of genetic information contained in human DNA."
589,"     For the first time, the key players in the tense confrontation between Nato and Russian troops talk about the stand-off which jeopardised the entire peacekeeping mission.      The Russians, who played a crucial role in persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the war, had expected to police their own sector of Kosovo, independent of Nato.      When they did not get it, they felt double-crossed.      As Nato's K-For peacekeepers prepared to enter the province on 12 June, they discovered the Russians had got there first.      A contingent of 200 troops, stationed in Bosnia, was already rolling towards Pristina airport.      'Third World War'      General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, immediately ordered 500 British and French paratroopers to be put on standby to occupy the airport.      ''I called the [Nato] Secretary General [Javier Solana] and told him what the circumstances were,'' General Clark tells the BBC programme Moral Combat: Nato at War.      ''He talked about what the risks were and what might happen if the Russian's got there first, and he said: 'Of course you have to get to the airport'.    ''I said: 'Do you consider I have the authority to do so?' He said: 'Of course you do, you have transfer of authority'.''      But General Clark's plan was blocked by General Sir Mike Jackson, K-For's British commander.      ""I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,"" he reportedly told General Clark during one heated exchange.      General Jackson tells the BBC: ''We were [looking at] a possibility....of confrontation with the Russian contingent which seemed to me probably not the right way to start off a relationship with Russians who were going to become part of my command.''      Russian plans      The Russian advance party took the airport unopposed. The world watched nervously.      A senior Russian officer, General Leonid Ivashev, tells the BBC how the Russians had plans to fly in thousands of troops.      ''Let's just say that we had several airbases ready. We had battalions of paratroopers ready to leave within two hours,'' he said.      Amid fears that Russian aircraft were heading for Pristina, General Clark planned to order British tanks and armoured cars to block the runways to prevent any transport planes from landing.      General Clark said he believed it was ''an appropriate course of action''. But the plan was again vetoed by Britain.      Partition fears      Instead, he asked neighbouring countries, including Hungary and Romania not to allow Russian aircraft to overfly their territory.    During the stand-off, Moscow insisted its troops would be answerable only to its own commanders.      Nato refused to accept this, predicting it would lead to the partition of Kosovo into an ethnic Albanian south and a Serbian north.      A deal on the deployment of Russian peacekeepers was reached in early July.      The Russians now operate as part of K-For in sectors controlled by Nato states, but are not directly under Nato's command.      Moral Combat: Nato at War will be broadcast at 9pm this Sunday on BBC2 Details of Russia's surprise occupation of Pristina airport at the end of the Kosovo war are revealed in a new BBC documentary on the conflict.For the first time, the key players in the tense confrontation between Nato and Russian troops talk about the stand-off which jeopardised the entire peacekeeping mission.The Russians, who played a crucial role in persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the war, had expected to police their own sector of Kosovo, independent of Nato.When they did not get it, they felt double-crossed.As Nato's K-For peacekeepers prepared to enter the province on 12 June, they discovered the Russians had got there first.A contingent of 200 troops, stationed in Bosnia, was already rolling towards Pristina airport.General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, immediately ordered 500 British and French paratroopers to be put on standby to occupy the airport.''I called the [Nato] Secretary General [Javier Solana] and told him what the circumstances were,'' General Clark tells the BBC programme Moral Combat: Nato at War.''He talked about what the risks were and what might happen if the Russian's got there first, and he said: 'Of course you have to get to the airport'."
590,"An international human rights group, says it is presenting a dossier to the ICC in The Hague on Tuesday containing compelling witness statements.  Minority Rights Group International say they have gathered evidence of mass killings, cannibalism and rape.  The ICC say their most urgent task is to pursue DR Congo's war criminals.  More than 600,000 pygmies are believed to live in the DR Congo's huge forests, where they survive by hunting wild animals and gathering fruits.  However, many Congolese regard them as ""subhuman"" with some believing their flesh can confer magical powers.  ""There have been systemic rapes and killings on a huge scale,"" the group's director, Mark Latimer, told the BBC's Network Africa.  He is calling on ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo to charge those responsible.  One witness they spoke to survived the late night massacre of an entire village. He said that everyone was shot and hacked to death and the huts were burnt.  ""This level of quite horrific violence which has been perpetrated against the pygmies is part, or was part, of a campaign aimed at exterminating them,"" he said.  He identified the rebel group, the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, which is part of the transitional government and still controls much of the north, and their allies, as being behind much of the violence against the pygmies."
591,"A hotel on the Isle of Wight has partially collapsed after a fire broke out during a wedding reception on Saturday night.  The Ryde Castle Hotel, in Ryde, was evacuated and six fire crews called just after 22:00 GMT. No-one was hurt.  Fire investigators are trying to find out if a fireworks display during the wedding reception caused the blaze.  Crews were withdrawn from the building just before the collapse and were still at the scene on Sunday damping down.  Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service said it was focusing on the fireworks display as part of the investigation.  Chief fire officer Steve Apter said about 50 firefighters tackled the fire.  He said: ""[They] were faced with quite a serious fire in the roof and the upper floors in the middle part of the building.  ""The problem is it's an old building of old construction so access was particularly difficult for crews.  ""We managed to bring the fire under control and stop it from spreading any further.  ""There was, unfortunately, a wedding party taking place in the hotel at the time so they were evacuated very swiftly with the management of the hotel.  ""Everybody was out of the building when firefighters arrived on scene.  ""We have had a collapsed middle part of the building so obviously very dangerous and difficult conditions for firefighters to be working in but thankfully no injuries.""  He said guests who were staying at the hotel had been moved to alternative accommodation.  Police had been informed about the fireworks display at the hotel about two hours before crews were called to the fire.  Mr Apter said: ""Eyewitness reports state that fireworks were actually being set off from the roof of the hotel.""  But, he added, it was not yet known if the display had caused the blaze, but that was subject to investigation.  The castle website claims the building was commissioned by Henry VIII in about 1540 to defend the Spithead, Southampton Water and the Solent from the invasion by the Spanish Armada.  However, historians say the castle is an early Victorian or Georgian structure.  It is thought to have been built in about 1840 as a private family home.  During World War I, the building was used as a hospital and during World War II it was an army headquarters.  ""It's very sad to see that much damage to an historic building and obviously the disappointment for the unlucky wedding couple,"" Mr Apter added."
592,"Leeds United have signed former Chelsea and Birmingham City striker Mikael Forssell until the end of the season.  The 30-year-old had been playing for Hannover 96 in Germany for the last three years but was out of contract.  ""I've missed English football and I really wanted to come back here,"" the Finland international said.  ""To come to a club like Leeds is fantastic. I've been working hard and training over the summer.""  Forssell joined Chelsea from HJK Helsinki in July 1998 and made 53 appearances scoring 12 goals.  Before signing for Birmingham in 2005, for £3m, he went on loan to Crystal Palace and Borussia Moenchengladbach.  He also had two loan spells at St Andrew's before making his switch permanent.  In total he played 118 games for Blues, scoring 37 goals before leaving for Germany in July 2008.  ""I played against Leeds a couple of times for Birmingham but now I'm on this side and it's fantastic,"" he added.  ""It is such an historic club, the team is good, the lads are positive, the facilities are unbelievable and the fans look brilliant."""

594,"The Australian economy has unexpectedly avoided falling into recession after its economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of 2009. Increased exports and consumer spending helped the economy to rebound from the 0.5% contraction recorded between October and December last year. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the country was now the only advanced economy not in recession. An economy is said to be in recession after two straight quarters of decline. To help avoid the country falling in recession, the Australian central bank cut interest rates to a 45-year low of 3.25% in February. We have technically avoided recession, but if you look at the details in the data it is not a pretty picture    The government also introduced a number of multi-billion dollar stimulus packages, including increased infrastructure spending and cash handouts to most Australians since the end of last year to lift consumer spending. Despite the economic growth in the first quarter of the year, Mr Rudd said Australia remained at risk of recession. ""We're not out of the woods yet, we've got a long way to go,"" he said. Analysts agreed that the risk of recession remained as 2009 continues. ""We have technically avoided recession, but if you look at the details in the data it is not a pretty picture,"" said Australian-based JP Morgan economist Helen Kevans. ""We have imports falling off a cliff, which is a symptom of firms smashing investment and which is bad for our employment outlook.""     "
595,"Heathrow Airport has unveiled three options for a new runway, saying each one would be ""quicker and cheaper"" than plans for a rival hub airport.  The airport's submission to the Davies Commission, which is looking at raising airport capacity, outlined a runway to the north, north-west or south-west of the existing airport.  It said a new runway could be in place by 2029, allowing 260,000 more flights.  Heathrow submitted its options to the government-appointed Airports Commission, headed by former Financial Services Authority chairman Sir Howard Davies.  It is reviewing how the UK might expand its airport capacity in south-east England and interested parties have until Friday 19 July to submit their preferred options.  Ahead of submitting its proposals on Friday, Gatwick bosses said this week that they would prefer ""a constellation system of three London airports - keeping Heathrow open, whilst building an additional runway at Gatwick, and then perhaps in time a new runway at Stansted"".  On Monday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson published proposals for three possible replacement hubs - an artificial island in the Thames Estuary dubbed ""Boris Island"", a major expansion at Stansted, or an airport at the Isle of Grain in north Kent.  The commission is expected to recommend options by the end of this year, but will not submit its final report until summer 2015 - after the next general election.  According to Heathrow's submission, building a new runway would deliver extra capacity at the airport by 2025-29 and would allow it to operate 740,000 flights a year - up from the current limit of 480,000.  Heathrow's preferred option would be to place a new runway to the north-west or the south-west of the airport.  This would ""deliver a full-length third runway while minimising the impact on the local community"".  The submission also detailed how a new westerly runway would help reduce noise pollution because planes would not have to fly so low over London.  It predicted that, even with a third runway, there would be 10-20% fewer people affected by noise under its new plans.  Each of the options would mean the compulsory purchase of some properties and some property demolitions, as well as potentially major work on the M25.  Stanwell Moor is a village near Heathrow and one of its councillors said it would ""get completely destroyed"" under one of the options.  I've just been looking back through my notes from last year, when I talked to government officials about the prospect of building a third runway at Heathrow. They told me it was ""dead and buried"" and said they'd look at ""all ideas bar a third runway"". Back then we also had a Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, who lived under the flight path and had campaigned against the plan. What a difference to today, when a third runway at the UK's biggest and busiest airport is very much back on the table. This is a big week for airports. By Friday, we'll know all the different suggestions on how they could expand. But don't let all this apparent momentum fool you. This is one of the thorniest issues in politics, and there are plenty in the industry who think that 20 years from now, nothing will have actually been done.  ""I wasn't totally surprised because we knew these would be in the pipeline but it's a pretty desperate situation and pretty frightening,"" said Robert Evans.  ""The real problem now is the area is blighted and there will be a period of uncertainty; people will be anxious because they bought their homes and now they find the home isn't the asset they thought.""  Residents' group Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise (Hacan) said it would fight any proposal for a new runway ""tooth and nail"".  Hacan chairman John Stewart said it was difficult to square Heathrow's claim that expansion could take place while cutting noise for residents.  Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews said the UK ""desperately needed a single hub airport with the capacity to provide the links to emerging economies which can boost UK jobs, GDP and trade"".  ""It is clear the best solution for taxpayers, passengers and business is to build on the strength we already have at Heathrow,"" he said.  Mr Matthews said he had not ruled out a fourth runway at Heathrow, but said this would not be needed until at least 2040.  However, Mr Johnson said the proposals for a new runway at Heathrow ""were politically, environmentally and socially unacceptable"".  ""There will be more pigs flying than aircraft if we are to believe the claim that three runways at Heathrow will make less noise than two,"" he said.  Mr Johnson added the move ""would be a disastrous outcome for Londoners, nor would it solve our aviation capacity crisis as a fourth runway would need to be in the planning process before a third was even open"".  Greenpeace accused the airport of presenting a ""reheated and rehashed"" plan with the same ""flawed arguments that failed so categorically last time around"".  But business groups backed the plans, including the trade body which represents Britain's airlines.  The Board of Airline Representatives said no other proposal so far on airport capacity could ""deliver the UK's hub airport capacity quicker, at the right cost, or in the right place for airlines and their passengers""."
596,"Sometimes, they are little more than holes, in the woods outside villages or even in backyards and under houses, but Ukraine's illegal coal mines can also be huge, open-cast operations. What started as hand-to-mouth survival, 20 years ago, is now big business.  Mihailo Volynets, the wiry head of Ukraine's Independent Miners' Union, presents the situation flatly: ""We know how much coal there is from the state mines and from the private mines, and we know how much coal is up for sale.""  About 6.5m tonnes more coal - 10% of Ukraine's total output - is for sale than is officially mined. ""There's no explanation... maybe Martians brought it,"" Mr Volynets jokes, without laughing.  Illegal mining in the Donbass and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine is there for all to see. Coal trucks routinely rumble along roads where there are no legal mines.  A brief stroll in the woods outside the town of Snizhne passes by three pits. But the money made from these mines does not make it into the nearby communities. Locals here have been agitating for a crackdown.  ""It is excessively dangerous for men to work in these pits and no one benefits from this here,"" says Ira, whose children, like so many, have moved away.  ""The whole region is just not functioning,""  For some, though, the illegal mining business is functioning fine. With no taxes to pay or workers' rights to respect, wildcat mines produce far cheaper coal than legal ones.  Thanks to their contacts in the murky world of Ukrainian politics and business, the illegal mining bosses can sell this coal via legal mines.  In so doing, notes Oleksa Shalayskiy of the anti-corruption website ""Nashi Groshi"" (""Our money""), owners of illegal mines can even benefit from state subsidies, intended to cover costs that have not been incurred.  ""It's just another way of siphoning taxpayers' money into private hands,"" he says.  In Donetsk it is widely believed that powerful people are creaming off the profits.  Mr Shalayskiy points out that Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and historically a staunch supporter of President Viktor Yanukovych, is seeing his legal mines lose out to the illegal competition.  Mr Akhmetov has made no public comment about this.  However, on condition of anonymity, a source close to Mr Akhmetov's mining company DTEK confirmed for the BBC that the company was deeply concerned about illegal mining. It constitutes unfair competition, and lures young miners away with better pay, albeit to worse and more dangerous conditions.  In February two publications, Kommersant Ukraine and Zerkalo Nedeli, suddenly ran stories that harshly criticised the illegal mining situation, arousing suspicion that somebody powerful had put the newspapers up to it and provided information.  Ukrainian journalists suspect that anonymous aerial shots published in Zerkalo Nedeli and elsewhere must have been provided by some legal mining companies.  Meanwhile, according to Mihailo Volynets, the economy is under a dire threat, since more than 95% of Ukraine's domestic energy resources are in the form of coal.  ""If this situation continues for another two years,"" he says, ""then dozens of state mines will have to close down. Ukraine will become dependent on imports not only of gas and oil, but of coal, too."""
597,"Dave Evans is one of a group of 30 Cornish men and women who decided to travel to Mexico to try and re-trace the path of their ancestors who set off from Cornwall to start a new life in Mexico.  He and his fellow travellers are members of the Cornish Mexican Cultural Society who are making the journey for both personal and official reasons.  Councillor June Charman, the Mayor of Camborne, is also making the journey to reinforce the community links between Camborne and Mexico.  They are accompanied and helped in their search by historian Richard Williams.  In 1825 a band of 60 Cornishmen left Falmouth with 1500 tons of mining machinery.  They were leaving a Cornwall enjoying a booming mining industry and planned to travel to Real del Monte, deep in the Mexican interior, to use their skills and technology to rescue its ailing silver mining industry.  It was to be a difficult journey for many reasons.  Following the long sea voyage they tried to put into port in Mexico, only to find that it was held by the Spanish.     They were forced to land the machinery on the beach at Mocambo and then haul it through jungle and swamp to their first depot at Santa Fe.  This was just the first of many setbacks - recorded faithfully by John Buchanan, an engineer in the party who kept a diary of the journey.  It is largely because of the diary that we are able to follow their hardships and triumphs today.  During this haul through the jungle, the 'sickly season' started and both the Cornishmen and their Mexican helpers fell victim to the ravages of Yellow Fever.  It was three months before they were able to return to continue transporting the machinery and progress was painfully slow because they had to build their own road as they went.  It took them 14 months to travel just 250 miles - no wonder Mexicans call it 'The Great Trek'.  On May 1st 1826, they finally entered Real del Monte, the highest town in Mexico at 10,000 feet above sea level.  As engineer John Buchanan reported in his diary: ""After great labour and many accidents we conquered this great ascent and our convoy proceeded on our last stage to deposit its valuable cargo in Real del Monte"".  The Cornish community flourished and stayed for the best part of a century - until the Mexican revolution in 1910.  They have never been forgotten according to Cornish descendant Ricardo Ludlow.  They bake as many pasties here as in the whole of Cornwall, albeit spiced up for the Mexican palette, and it is said that the first game of Mexican soccer was played in the yard of the Dolores Mine!  Our modern-day group are travelling in the comfort of a coach and are feted along the way in towns like Vera Cruz where they attend a demonstration of traditional Mexican dancing.  But while the main party attend civic functions to welcome them, Dave Evans has gone on ahead to try and get a head start on the search for remaining members of his family.  He finally strikes gold in Pachuca's mining archives where he finds employment details of both his grand and great grandfathers.  Then a chance meeting with the hotel accountant, Julio Rivero, leads Dave to news of another relative - his great cousin Betty, who taught English to Julio.  Unfortunately 'Miss Betty', as the former teacher was known, has now died - but Julio thinks he can help Dave find his grandfather's and father's house.  Dave presents her with the official Cornish Mexican Cultural Society badge as a thank you for her family's help in tracing his roots.  Seven hundred Cornish men and women are buried in the cemetery overlooking Real del Monte and the local community hold a moving memorial ceremony in honour of their Cornish visitors - with 'Abide With Me' sung in Spanish.  Hunting among the graves, Dave finds many more than he expected, including those of his cousin Betty, and his Uncle William's - who's death at this point, however, still remains a mystery.  But once home, Dave receives an e-mail from a Patrica Gomez Evans.  She has news about Dave's uncle William so he rings her to find out what she knows.  It turns out that Patricia is William's grand daughter but she has some upsetting news.  It appears that William committed suicide by shooting himself.  Dave explains that this could be a result of shell shock William suffered from fighting in World War I.  He is already planning another trip to Mexico to meet Patricia to find out more about his Cornish Mexican family.  This is just the start of another journey of discovery to discover the links between Cornwall and Mexico..."
598,"Mr Godsiff defended the tactic, saying his opponents were not being honest A Labour candidate is embroiled in a row with the Liberal Democrats after suggesting they would give convicted murderers and paedophiles the vote. Roger Godsiff, who is standing in Birmingham Hall Green, issued leaflets showing nursery worker Vanessa George, who was jailed for abusing children. He defended the move, saying his opponents were evading scrutiny, but Labour have now scrapped the leaflet. The Lib Dems said they would not give those currently in prison the vote. However, they stressed the issue needed to be looked at following a 2005 ruling by the European Court of Rights that found the UK's ban on extending the vote to convicted prisoners was unlawful Ministers have been consulting on how to respond to the ruling since then with critics accusing them of kicking the issue into the long grass. Leaflets distributed under Mr Godsiff's name asked: ""Do you want convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles to be given the vote? The Lib Dems do"". The leaflets contained pictures of a number of high-profile criminals including Vanessa George and Steven Wright, convicted in 2008 for the murder of five women in the Ipswich area. As soon as it came to my attention I immediately ensured that no more of these would be distributed    Mr Godsiff defended the campaign tactic, saying the Lib Dems' policy on the issue was ""black and white"" but they were not making that clear to voters. ""I agree that the imagery is strong but I do not accept that it is any stronger than anything that has been put out by my opponents,"" Mr Godsiff told the BBC. ""The leaflet has been distributed in certain areas but it does not contain anything that is factually incorrect. I have put out some negative campaigning when my opponents do not tell the electorate what their position is. ""It is right and proper to ask whether they support or do not support whether people convicted of serious crimes can vote. I have invited other candidates to make their position clear....I have made my position clear."" Asked whether he had personally sanctioned the leaflets, he said he would not discuss the ""mechanics"" of his campaign but accused the Lib Dems of lying about his policies and voting record. However, Labour have acted to defuse the row, saying the leaflet was not approved at a national level. ""This was a locally produced leaflet,"" Ray Collins, the party's general secretary, said. ""As soon as it came to my attention I immediately ensured that no more of these would be distributed."" The Lib Dems said they were ""unhappy"" with the claims and did not favour any attempt to give already convicted prisoners the vote, describing such a step as a ""legal minefield"". But, in future, they said judges should be given discretion to decide, upon sentencing, whether to strip someone of the vote, depending on the length of sentence and the nature of the crime. Once a new system was in place, they said existing prisoners should be given the right to launch an appeal to try and secure the vote. However, they insisted that those guilty of the most serious crime should never be able to do this.     "
599,"In June the government said £2.2bn raised by the National Lottery will go towards funding the London Olympics.  But the London Assembly culture and sport committee report said diverting funds may do more harm than good.  Chairman Dee Doocey said it was ludicrous that the grassroots groups that encourage children into sport and the arts will miss out.  Both the Cultural Olympiad - a four-year programme of events aimed at increasing participation in cultural activity - and the Government's Olympic sports participation target - to increase the number of people who are physically active by two million by 2012 - were identified as being heavily dependent on smaller grassroots organisations.  But the report, by the assembly's economic development, culture, sport and tourism committee, said it was these very organisations that would be hardest hit by the funding diversion.  It estimated that of the £2.2bn being taken from lottery causes to contribute to the £9.3bn needed to host the Games, London will lose about £440m.  Ms Doocey said: ""We are not denying that the capital will reap huge benefits as host city of the 2012 Games.  ""However, our investigation shows that the on-the-ground opportunities Londoners were promised are at risk because the funding diversion effectively ham-strings the organisations needed to deliver them.""  She said that while it was not yet clear who would lose what, their research suggested that smaller organisations would suffer the most.  The investigation was launched in response to growing concern from lottery-funded organisations about the impact of the funding diversion."
600,"Mr El-Banna could be extradited to Spain to face terror allegations Two UK residents released by the US from Guantanamo Bay have been released on bail after appearing in court under Spanish extradition warrants. Magistrates are considering extraditing Jamil El-Banna and Omar Deghayes to Spain to face terror allegations. The men, accused of being al-Qaeda members in Madrid, will be tagged and placed under curfew. Abdenour Samuer, who was also held at Guantanamo, was arrested and held in custody but released without charge. He was released from Paddington Green police station. Following his release, Mr El-Banna, a father of five, said in a statement: ""Thank you very much everybody, my solicitor, the British people, the British government for your help. ""I'm tired. I want to go home and see my children."" Mr El-Banna, 45, was detained under port and border controls and arrested on Thursday morning after questioning at a Dunstable police station. He appeared at the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London looking dishevelled and bewildered. To do this when they are so close to home and their families, I think, is reprehensible    Appearing later at the court, Mr Deghayes was also granted bail of £50,000. He said later in a statement: ""I am very, very happy to be home. I am very grateful to everybody who has helped me. ""I would have been happier if everybody in Guantanamo were released and that ugly, bad place was closed down if not demolished. ""I need some rest, but I will be very happy to speak to everybody in the media to help other people to be released."" The actress and human rights campaigner Vanessa Redgrave, who put forward part of Mr El-Banna's surety, said it had been a ""profound honour"" to be able to help. She said: ""I'm glad I'm alive to be able to do this. Guantanamo Bay is a concentration camp. It's a disgrace that these men have been kept there all these years, and today Jamil will be back home."" As part of his bail conditions, Mr El-Banna must obey a curfew, live at his home in Dollis Hill, north London, and wear an electronic tag. The court heard as a member of the Islamic Alliance, Mr El-Banna had allegedly helped to recruit people to terrorist training camps and distributed terrorist propaganda between 1996 and 2001. His lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said there would be massive issues as to the lapse of time over extradition and his human rights. Protesters against his detention and family members gathered outside court. Among them was Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather, MP for Mr El-Banna, who described Spain's move as ""extremely distasteful and very insensitive"". Mr El-Banna is waiting to be reunited with his family Earlier, Clive Stafford Smith, another of Mr El-Banna's lawyers, accused the government of lying about the three men's release. ""To do this when they are so close to home and their families, I think, is reprehensible,"" he said. ""It would have been fine if that was what they [the government] had told us was going to happen. I have no problem with them questioning my clients but they lied."" He said he had previously tried to encourage a Spanish extradition request as a means of getting the men out of Guantanamo, but said the authorities in Madrid had never showed any interest. ""For quite a long time, we tried to get the Spanish to demand their release because we thought it was an elegant way to get them out of Guantanamo. The Spanish weren't interested,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. Mr El-Banna first came to the security services' attention because he knew Abu Qatada, a radical cleric, described as a ""key UK figure"" in al-Qaeda related terror activity. Mr Deghayes, 38, and Mr Samuer, 34, were arrested on board an aircraft shortly after it arrived from Guantanamo. Mr Stafford Smith said Mr Deghayes had been detained in Guantanamo accused of committing terrorist acts against the United States, after Spanish intelligence services obtained a video. The Chechen terrorist training video purports to show Mr Deghayes, but a BBC Newsnight investigation revealed the man in question was actually Abu Walid, a Saudi who is now dead. Mr Stafford Smith told Newsnight that the Spanish case was based on false evidence and the situation was ""dismaying"". ""The idea now that they want to use this evidence we've proved to be false to take them for further detention is very worrying,"" he added. Both Mr El-Banna and Mr Deghayes were among four Guantanamo detainees named in December 2003 by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, over alleged al-Qaeda links. Judge Garzon recommended that all four stand trial in Spain, but only two suspects - a Moroccan man and a Spanish national - were extradited. Both were cleared of wrongdoing. The Home Office agreed the release of the three men with the US on 10 December following intensive negotiations. Another freed UK resident, Shaker Abdur-Raheem Aamer, is expected to return to his native Saudi Arabia. A fifth UK resident, Ethiopian Binyam Mohammed, will remain at Guantanamo. The Pentagon insists that all five of the British residents are dangerous. The Americans accused Palestinian Mr El-Banna of being an al-Qaeda recruiter and financier, Libyan Mr Deghayes of associating with al-Qaeda, and Algerian Mr Samuer of being trained for combat in Afghanistan. About 300 prisoners are held at Guantanamo Bay, set up at a US naval base in Cuba in early 2002 after the invasion of Afghanistan.     "
601,"The island state of Sao Tome and Principe has signed a loan deal with former colonial power Portugal aimed at anchoring the currency to the euro.  One of Africa's poorest countries, it has significant but as yet unexploited oil reserves.  Officials from the two countries have spent a year working on the accord, which is aimed at securing economic stability for the archipelago.  Sao Tome's leaders say linking its currency, the dobra, to the euro is a guarantee of stability for foreign investors and a key element of the country's economic strategy.  Portugal, which once ruled Sao Tome and which has received many of its citizens as immigrants, is providing loans to its government in return for fiscal and monetary policy commitments.  The accord is no panacea, officials acknowledged, but should act as a lever for development.  A similar accord a decade ago between Portugal and Cape Verde helped that island nation shed its status as one of the world's least-developed countries, and later secure a special partnership with the EU.  Sao Tome, where the economy is dominated by cocoa farming and remittances from emigrants, is considerably poorer than Cape Verde.  But its territorial waters hide significant oil reserves that are just starting to be explored."
602,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The Irish Republic has unveiled its second budget in six months to deal with its rapidly contracting economy. The emergency budget includes a large rise in taxes and a cut in spending, to deal with Ireland's budget deficit. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan also said an independent agency would take over banks' bad assets to try and restore lending. His forecast for 2009 was also revised down sharply. He expects it to contract by 8% this year, down from 3% in 2008. Dublin is having to deal with a deepening recession while being forced to correct the worst deficit in Europe. The first lesson is that, if you're lurching further and further into debt, there comes a point when fiscal stimulus isn't very stimulating at all    The total reduction in gross government spending for 2009 will total 1.8bn euros Mr Lenihan said, while further savings of 4.8bn euros will be required between 2010 to 2011. ""First, and most urgent, we must stabilise our public finances. Until we show that we can put our own house in order, we cannot expect those who have invested here and who might invest here in the future to have confidence in us,"" said Mr Lenihan. BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders explained that: ""There's method to his madness. And also some lessons for the UK."" ""The first lesson is that, if you're lurching further and further into debt, there comes a point when fiscal stimulus isn't very stimulating at all."" The latest move in Ireland is in contrast to other nations which have been increasing spending and lowering taxes to encourage economic revival. The finance minister said the key aims of the budget include: The Republic had relied too heavily on the housing sector, which had proved to be a bubble, Mr Lenihan said. But speaking before the Dail, Brian Lenihan said it would be wrong to assume that it was only the collapse in the housing and construction sector which was to blame for the Republic's recession. It had been especially hard hit due to the nature of Ireland's small and open economy, he said. Any future economic recovery would have to be based on a revival in exports. The Irish budget will try and tackle record unemployment Looking ahead, Mr Lenihan lowered his forecast for economic growth, saying the economy was likely to contract by 8% in 2009, more than a recent forecast of 6.75% and significantly higher than the 3% contraction experienced in 2008. He said this change marked ""a serious decline in national living standards: the sharpest fall on record. Forecasts for 2010 are not as severe"". In light of the deterioration in the finance sector, Ireland will become one of the first countries to establish an agency to take over toxic assets from banks. This, the finance minister said, would help give banks a ""clean bill of health"", reduce uncertainty in the system and try to get credit flowing again to businesses and individuals. As for taxes, he reiterated that those earning the most should pay the most. ""With up to 40% of income earners paying no income tax at all, we can no longer meet our fiscal needs."" ""The challenge is to spread the burden in a fair manner to a wider range of income earners while avoiding economic disincentive effects,"" said Mr Lenihan. The rates of the income levy - which is a way of raising taxes in the middle of the tax year - will double while the threshold at which each begins will be lowered. The new rates will be 2%, 4% and 6%, and the new thresholds will be 15,028 euros, 75,036 and 174,980 euros respectively. Mr Lenihan said tax on cigarettes would rise by 25 cents per packet but there would be no increase in duty on alcohol or petrol as he was concerned any rise would lead to a loss of revenue. And the rates of Capital Gains Tax and Capital Acquisitions Tax is being increased 25%, effective immediately. He said pay in the public sector, which represents a large part of the Irish economy, had to be reassessed. At the highest level it had become overinflated in recent years and needed to be reduced. ""The problem is our expenditure base is too high and our revenue base is too low. If we fail, refuse or neglect to address this structural problem we will condemn our generation and the next to the folly of excessive borrowing."" A review of top level pay rates is being launched ""to take account of the changed budgetary and economic circumstances, and the changed private sector pay."" Such changes would include reductions in ministerial pensions and expenses arrangements.     "
603,"German software company SAP says it hopes to recruit hundreds of people with autism, saying they have a unique talent for information technology.  The firm said that by 2020, 1% of its global workforce of 65,000 employees would be people with autism.  Autism is a developmental disorder that can cause problems with social interaction and physical behaviour.  However, some people with the condition are highly intelligent and have a keen attention to detail.  SAP executive Luisa Delgado said the company believed that ""innovation comes from the edges"".  She added: ""Only by employing people who think differently and spark innovation will SAP be prepared to handle the challenges of the 21st Century.""  SAP has already hired six people with autism at its office in Bangalore, India, where they work as software testers.  The firm said its productivity had increased as a result of their efforts, and it now plans to take on more such staff in other countries.  The recruitment drive is being undertaken in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish social organisation that helps people with autism find work with information technology companies.  Autistic spectrum disorders, including Asperger's syndrome, are thought to affect about 1% of the population worldwide."

Approval for the stadium, which will house the Reading Racers speedway team and a greyhound track, in 2007.  The Smallmead track was demolished in 2008 but the ""Racino"" plan, due to be ready this year, has stalled.  Developers Gaming International should have started work by June but now has until March to start building with fans hoping speedway can return in 2012.  The Racino, an American term for a casino and racing track, will be accompanied by a 538-space car park and free-standing kennels.  The Smallmead track at Island Road off the A33 has been home to the Reading speedway team since 1975.  Malcolm Holloway, former promoter of the Reading Racers, said: ""It has taken a long time, reason being as I understand is that the people putting the money up for the stadium wanted it turned so they had to redo all the planning and things like that.  ""But I did manage to get hold of one of the interested parties and he said it should all be up and running for the 2012 season.  ""I do feel sorry for Reading people but the fans are still here, they are always asking me what is happening and how long it will be.""  Gaming International declined to comment about the extension.  Reading Borough Council said: ""[Our] position has always been that we remain fully committed to the delivery of a new stadium to host top class speedway and greyhound racing in Reading, and that remains the case.""  The authority said the extension will allow Gaming International to meet a number of conditions necessary before construction starts."
605,"A stampede at a World Cup football match in Harare has killed 12 people.  Police fired tear gas when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had scored a second goal against Zimbabwe.    Fans at the match had been chanting opposition slogans, taunting police with the open-handed salute of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).  Some at the game suggested that the police had overreacted because they were irritated by the pro-MDC chants.  Most of the deaths were from internal injuries consistent with being crushed, a doctor said.  Players writhed on the turf, choking and covering their faces in an attempt to get away from the tear gas.  The trouble comes just days after South Africa lost out by one vote to Germany for the right to host the World Cup in 2006.  South Africa had just gone 2-0 up in the 84th minute when the trouble erupted.    Delron Buckley had just scored his second goal when he fell to the ground holding his injured left ankle, and bottles began to fly on to the pitch.  Police responded by firing teargas canisters into the near-capacity 60,000 crowd, who raced to the exits.  The match was abandoned, as players from both teams lay face down on the pitch, and received treatment from medical personnel before being escorted from the pitch.  Officials at the ground were outraged by the police action, describing their response as ""total over-reaction"".  Football's governing body, Fifa, will have to decide what action to take after receiving a report from the match commissioner.  The game was abandoned, with South Africa officially declared the winners.  Former England striker John Fashanu was at the game and was very unhappy with the reaction by the police.    ""It's been a bad week for African football. First South Africa losing the World Cup bid, and now this.  ""The police over-reacted, very stupidly. We didn't need this to happen. Football in Africa is a passion, a carnival.  ""The bottle-throwing and then the police over-reacting the way they did - it was too terrible. They were very poor in their crowd control.  ""Africa must wake up, we need to show the world that Africa has grown up,"" Fashanu said."
606,"Fray Bentos: The town was once known as ""Kitchen of the World"" After many years the small western Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos is once again exporting the product that gave it name recognition around the world: corned beef. Initially manufactured for the working classes, the tinned cooked meat became a staple for many people in Britain and continental Europe. ""I was brought up on it. I remember eating corned beef until it came out of my ears,"" said Prince Charles during a visit to Uruguay in 1999. Fray Bentos is the original location of the main factory of the German-British Liebig Extract of Meat Company. Established in 1863, it produced meat extract, tinned beef and by-products. The factory exported its goods around the world Renamed the Anglo Meatpacking plant in 1924, the factory fed generations of Europeans and allied troops during World War I and II. Such was its importance as a food exporter that the town was once known as ""The Kitchen of the World"". ""Not only did our products fill European stomachs; they also got into European hearts and minds,"" said historian Rene Boretto, director of the Museum of the Industrial Revolution, which is on the site of the former abattoir. ""In World War I, soldiers would say 'Fray Bentos' to indicate that something was good, the same way we nowadays say OK, "" Mr Boretto said. Further proof of the product's impact, he said, was the fact that during that war, when there were only a few tanks, British soldiers named one of them ""Fray Bentos"" because inside it they felt like tinned meat. Thirty years after the closure of the Anglo Meatpacking Plant, the Brazilian-owned Marfrig Group is producing corned beef in Fray Bentos once again and exporting it to Britain. Exports to the United States were set to start at the end of October. Julio Bonizzi, Marfrig's plant manager, said the company was already producing corned beef at its Brazilian plants but decided that Fray Bentos offered an inexpensive and simple way to expand production capacity. ""The opening of this plant has a double meaning for us,"" said Omar Lafluf, the local mayor. ""First, we are resuming production of a staple that made us world pioneers, and that gave global recognition to this town. Second, it provides an important source of jobs, employing more than 100 people."" Residents of this small Uruguayan town, which has a population of 23,000, are proud to have recovered the industry that put them on the world map and employed several generations of fraybentinos. ""I work in the labelling department, doing the same job my husband's grandmother did at the Anglo,"" said Leticia Martinez at Marfrig's plant. In its heyday, the Anglo factory employed several thousand people Her husband, Marcelo Da Rocha, says that corned beef gave jobs to his whole family: he, his brothers, cousins, uncles and grandparents have all worked in meat processing. Recalling his days at the Anglo, where he began work at age 14, Norberto Bordoli, now 84, said the factory attracted employees from afar. ""Workers came from almost 60 countries. My grandfather came from Italy to work here, and I worked at the plant until it closed."" The end of the WWII, coupled with both Europe's economic recovery and outdated equipment at the plant, led to the factory's closure in 1979, explains historian Rene Boretto. Although the opening of the new plant is good news for the town, it is far smaller than its predecessor, the Anglo. In its heyday in the 1940s, 5,000 people worked in the five-storey building. More than 200 types of tinned and processed food were produced, not only meat by-products but also vegetables, sweets and jams. The new plant's Brazilian owners think Fray Bentos is an ideal location ""Every day, 1,600 cows, 6,400 lambs and hundreds of pigs and turkeys were slaughtered. The smell was very intense in the whole city,"" recalls Mr Bordoli. According to Mr Boretto, ""The only part of the cow that went to waste was the moo."" ""Before the English arrived we only slaughtered the cow for its hide, tongue and some cuts of meat,"" he said. ""Then we learned that there was a market for each by-product. France bought bile stones for the perfume industry. Thick ear hair made into brushes, there were unthinkable uses."" In today's Fray Bentos, the mood is one of hope. Some people are taking advantage of a job opportunity in an industry that left its mark on the town and, for many, it is the continuation of a long family tradition they do not want to lose."
607,"The deal done on Friday was confirmed in a joint statement by the LSE and the Borsa Italiana.  Shareholders in the Milan stock exchange will be offered just under five shares of the LSE for each ordinary share in Borsa Italiana.  The new board will have seven British members and five Italians.  The merger was welcomed by the Bank of Italy and by Italian business and political leaders who described it as very beneficial for Italy.  The governor of the Bank of Italy, Mario Draghi, said it would bring the Italian stock market out of its present isolation. The Borsa Italiana was privatised by Mr Draghi 10 years ago.  A former president of the Borsa, Stefano Preda, said the merger would put an end to the marginalisation of Italian business and make international capital more accessible to Italian entrepreneurs.  The deal has still to be confirmed by shareholders but if it goes ahead it will strengthen confidence in Italian business in European markets.  Global stock exchanges have been seeking partners in recent years, in a bid to cut costs and increase business.  This deal comes just over a month after the completion of the New York Stock Exchange's takeover of Euronext, which controls the stock markets of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon."
608,"Deep Fritz won by four points to two, after taking the last game in 47 moves in a match lasting almost five hours.  Of the six games, Deep Fritz won two and four ended in draws.  The 31-year-old Russian, who received $500,000 (£253,000) for playing the machine, could have walked away with double if he had been successful.  After the game, Mr Kramnik said he was ""a bit disappointed"" but hoped a rematch could be arranged in a year or two.  ""With more time to prepare, I still have a chance,"" he said.  In 2002, Mr Kramnik held Deep Fritz to a draw after eight games, but the chess software has since been updated, calculating millions of positions every second.  In October, Mr Kramnik defeated Bulgaria's Veselin Topalov to become the undisputed world chess champion for the first time since 1993."
609,"Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been diagnosed with throat cancer.  The 66-year-old has a tumour in his larynx, a statement from the Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo said.  ""After multiple investigations, initial chemotherapy will start in the next few days. The patient is well,"" the statement read.  Lula was elected Brazil's president in 2002, the country's first leftist leader in half a century.  He was re-elected for a second term in 2006, and left office in December 2010 with record approval ratings.  A former union leader, Lula presided over a period of strong economic growth in Brazil during which millions of people were lifted out of poverty.  It was widely reported, in March 2010, that Lula had given up smoking after 50 years."
610,"The European Union is funding major restoration work at many of the monasteries and the monks are concerned that women's groups are trying to use the Schengen Agreement, which guarantees free access throughout Europe, to gain access to their remote monasteries.  The all-male monastic community is one of the more unlikely and vociferous opponents of the agreement - a small but angry group among the monks say that Schengen is the work of the devil and Satan's latest attempt to rule the earth.  Women - and even most female domestic animals - have not been allowed on the mountain since a decree, or Avaton, banning women was issued by Byzantine Emperor Constantine Monomachos in 1060.  The monks call their mountain the ""Garden of the Holy Virgin"" after the ancient legend which tells how the Virgin Mary, blown ashore on the mountain on her way to Cyprus, was so overwhelmed by the mountain's beauty that she asked God to give it to her as a present.  Since the 10th century, the monks have lived in a self-governing community dedicating themselves to quiet contemplation of the Virgin and God, out of the sight of women.  The only way women can view the monasteries is by taking one of the boats, which sail from the ""secular"" parts of Athos. Even these boats cannot sail closer than 500 metres from the coast  Last year the monks launched a vocal but unsuccessful campaign to try to prevent ratification of the agreement by the Greek parliament. The treaty was however, ratified in June 1997.  Kosta Karas, a writer on Orthodox affairs, says the monks' fears are unfounded, but many of them are suspicious nonetheless, especially after recent statements by some female opponents of the ban.  A number of female Finnish and Swedish Euro MPs have called for Mount Athos to be opened up to women, and a prominent Greek journalist, Fotoni Pipili, sent an open letter to parliament calling for the Avaton to be debated in parliament.  The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, both of them women, also recently refused to accept the special status of the mountain, arguing that the Avaton contradicted EU legislation.  Many of the more zealous monks are also angry that the Schengen database, which will be used to screen people seeking entry at member states' external borders, will brand some visitors with the mark of Satan.  One of their more arcane objections is that some of the identification numbers given to people by the database will include the combination 666 - the Mark of the Beast in the Book of Revelations. Mr Karas says this is an esoteric interpretation of Revelations.  Thousands of Orthodox zealots demonstrated against ratification last year chanting ""Satan is Schengen."" They say the treaty will rob people of their individuality, turning them into numbers on a computer.  The monks are also worried that the agreement, which would introduce stricter controls on external borders, could affect their traditional right to offer sanctuary.  Mount Athos has been a centre of Eastern Orthodoxy since AD963 and for centuries it has had Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian and Romanian religious houses among its 20 self-governing monasteries. The monks are automatically entitled to Greek and European citizenship wherever they come from.  Under the centuries-old Byzantine right of sanctuary, anyone reaching the Monastery could be given sanctuary and could not be executed. The monks of Mount Athos have retained this right. Schengen, they fear, could be the beginning of the end for their centuries-old rights.  Images reproduced with kind permission of the Demokritus University of Thrace"
611,"Siddiqul Islam, alias Bangla Bhai, of the outlawed Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (JMB) was captured at his hideout in Mymensingh district, the police said.  Last week, JMB leader Abdur Rahman surrendered to police in north-eastern Sylhet district.  Officials blame the group for a wave of bombings that have left many dead.  Security forces surrounded Islam's hideout in Muktagacha - near Mymensingh town about 110 km (70 miles) north of the national capital, Dhaka - on Sunday at midnight, Mashuk Hasan, an official of Bangladesh's top anti-crime outfit Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) told reporters.  The militants inside the house retaliated by throwing bombs and firing at the security forces and triggered a shootout, he said.  The militants even detonated a bomb inside the house which damaged the roof and injured seven people including RAB agents and Islam, he said.  ""During the raid Bangla Bhai detonated an explosive and he was slightly injured, "" Mr Hasan told reporters.  Islam, who lost a lot of blood and suffered burn and splinter injuries, was taken to a hospital in Mymensingh and underwent an operation, Dr Abdul Ahad, who treated Islam told the Associated Press news agency.  He was then flown to a paramilitary hospital in Dhaka, but his injuries are not life threatening, an RAB spokesman said.  The BBC's Roland Buerk says Bangla Bhai came into prominence in 2004 when his group, Jagrata Muslim Janata (Vigilant Muslim Citizens), launched a reign of terror in the north of the country.  He and the local authorities allegedly fought the Maoist rebels and imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law - forcing women to wear burqas and men to grow beards.  Recently the government said Islam was the second most important leader in the JMB.  In February, a Bangladeshi court sentenced Islam, Rahman and two others accused of Islamic militancy to 40 years in prison in absentia for a bomb attack that killed two judges last year.  Last August, some 500 bombs were set off in all but one of Bangladesh's 64 districts in the space of an hour. Three people were killed and about 100 injured.  A number of subsequent bomb attacks have targeted judges and court rooms.  More than 100 cases have been filed against alleged members of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen in connection with the bombing campaign.  The militant group has been demanding the introduction of Sharia law in the country."

613,"Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes has completed his takeover of Premier League newcomers QPR.  The 47-year-old has secured a 66% stake in the club, buying out previous majority shareholders Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone.  Fernandes will work alongside the Mittal Family, who have retained their 33% stake.  ""QPR is a raw diamond and hopefully I can contribute into turning it into a diamond,"" said Fernandes.  He will take the role of chairman of QPR Holdings Ltd and will be joined on the board by joint Tune Group owner Mr Kamarudin Bin Meranun, one of Malaysia's most successful business tycoons.  ""Everyone knows I've followed West Ham all my life but I've always had a soft spot for QPR,"" said Fernandes, who is also team principal of Formula 1's Team Lotus. ""Rangers were one of the first teams I watched as a child at Loftus Road.""  Amit Bhatia, who will resume his position as vice-chairman, told the club's official website: ""I'm very excited to welcome Tony to QPR and having spent considerable time with him, know that we share the same vision and values.  ""We have discussed in great detail how to restore pride at the club and I'm very pleased with the outcome of these discussions.  ""It was a very difficult decision to resign from the board when I did, so I'm thrilled to be back and would like to thank all those who supported me and my family and look forward to serving the club to the best of my abilities again.  ""Tony and I will work alongside each other to try and make this season as exciting and successful as possible. I love this club and this is a very happy day for me.""  Fernandes added: ""The opportunity to get involved with the club was mentioned to me by the previous owners and here I am.  ""I've always wanted to be involved in football and the appeal of a London club, like QPR, was too good an opportunity to turn down.""  QPR won promotion back to the Premier League by winning the Championship under manager Neil Warnock last season.  They kicked off their campaign back in the top flight with a 4-0 home defeat by Bolton last weekend but Fernandes has already given his backing to the former Sheffield United and Crystal Palace boss.  ""It's a momentous day,"" said Warnock. ""Everybody connected with QPR should be excited.""  Fernandes added: ""I have ambitions in the long term.  ""I could easily say we're going to win the Champions League and the Premier League but that's really not my style. I don't want to make big promises I can't guarantee.  ""I want the fans to be proud of what we're doing and be involved as much as we can.  ""The fans pay good money and are stakeholders, so whatever we do, I want the fans to be proud.

614,"Russia has agreed to lend Venezuela over $2bn (£1.2bn) to buy weapons, President Hugo Chavez has said. The credit will be used to purchase nearly 100 tanks and a series of anti-aircraft rocket systems from Russia. In his weekly TV address, Mr Chavez said the weapons were intended to boost Venezuela's defensive capacity. The deal comes as tensions grow between Venezuela and Colombia over Bogota's plan to allow the US access to several military bases there. Colombia says the US forces will help in the war against drugs and left-wing guerrillas, and will not destabilise the region. ""The Russian government approved financing of $2.2bn for the cost of the weapons,"" Mr Chavez said on his weekly programme ""Alo Presidente"". The money would be used to buy arms including 92 T-72 tanks and an S-300 rocket launch system, he said. Mr Chavez suggested that Colombia's decision to grant the US access to seven military bases was a threat to Venezuelan security. He said the anti-aircraft rockets systems would make it difficult to be attacked. ""With these rockets, it is going to be very difficult for them [the US] to come and bomb us. If that happens, they should know that we will soon have these systems installed, [and] for an enemy that appears on the horizon, there it goes,"" he said.    Mr Chavez said that the country's vast reserves of oil and gas demanded military protection. ""Venezuela has no plans to invade anybody, nor attack anybody,"" he said. ""These arms are necessary for our national defence."" He also reiterated that his government was committed to developing nuclear power with Russia's help. ""With Russia we have created an atomic energy commission and I tell the world - Venezuela is going to start developing nuclear energy, but we are not going to make an atomic bomb,"" Mr Chavez said. The loan announcement came days after Mr Chavez returned from a 10-day tour of Africa, Asia and Europe, during which he held two days of talks in Moscow. Over recent years the country has signed over $4bn worth of weapons contracts with Russia, including the purchase of 24 Sukhoi fighter jets, numerous combat helicopters and 100,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. Last November, the two states held joint exercises in the Caribbean Sea, close to US territorial waters.     "
615,"The 79 cassettes include discussions with employees the businessman suspected of disloyalty.  Maxwell drowned in 1991 in mysterious circumstances, shortly before it was revealed he had stolen £100m from the Mirror Group's pension fund.  The tapes were discovered during research for a BBC Two drama about Maxwell's life.  They include a conversation with his finance director Basil Brookes while Maxwell was on board his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, just hours before his death on 4 November 1991.  On one cassette the publishing baron, who associates have said had grown increasingly paranoid before his death, can be heard telling Mr Brookes to be careful to whom he showed a document because ""there are too many eyes walk[ing] around in that office"".  Maxwell had ordered John Pole, his then-director of security, to wire the telephone extensions of underlings he feared were challenging him.  These included board members of his two public companies, Maxwell Communications Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers, and trustees of the Mirror Group pension fund.  The tapes, which date from the summer to November of 1991, had been kept by Mr Pole in a suitcase for 15 years.  A wire-tap system had been discovered in the Mirror's Holborn building after Maxwell's death but the actual recordings had not been heard until now.  A total of 30,000 pensioners were affected by Maxwell's fraud.  Maxwell, starring David Suchet and Patricia Hodge, will be shown on BBC Two at 2100 BST on Friday 4 May."

But an adjudicator turned the plans down - citing the level of local opposition and concerns over funding.  Protester Polly Rubenstein said the decision to retain the two schools was ""wonderful news"".  Office of the Schools Adjudicator Elizabeth Passmore said a new school would have been the right outcome on educational grounds, but decided the opposition and doubt over adequate financial resources was crucial.  Mrs Rubenstein said: ""We are absolutely delighted - it is a victory for common sense so we are over the moon about this.""  She said it was a ""rare example of people power"".  Thousands of people signed a petition opposing the merger which said the two schools were successful and should be left alone.  But education officials had said the area needed a single school with better facilities rather than two under-subscribed schools."
617,"The film Suffragette, which is due for release, portrays the struggle by British women to win the vote. They were exposed to violence and intimidation as their campaign became more militant. So they taught themselves the martial art of jiu-jitsu.  Edith Garrud was a tiny woman. Measuring 4ft 11in (150cm) in height she appeared no match for the officers of the Metropolitan Police - required to be at least 5ft 10in (178cm) tall at the time. But she had a secret weapon.  In the run-up to World War One, Garrud became a jiu-jitsu instructor to the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), better known as the suffragettes, taking part in an increasingly violent campaign for votes for women.  Sick of the lack of progress, they resorted to civil disobedience, marches and illegal activities including assault and arson.  The struggle in the years before the war became increasingly bitter. Women were arrested and, when they went on hunger strike, were force-fed using rubber tubes. While out on marches, many complained of being manhandled and knocked to the ground. Things took a darker turn after ""Black Friday"" on 18 November 1910.  A group of around 300 suffragettes met a wall of policemen outside Parliament. Heavily outnumbered, the women were assaulted by both police and male vigilantes in the crowd. Many sustained serious injuries and two women died as a result. More than 100 suffragettes were arrested.  ""A lot said they had been groped by the police and male bystanders,"" says Elizabeth Crawford, author of The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide. ""After that, women didn't go to these demonstrations unprepared.""  Some started putting cardboard over their ribs for protection. But Garrud was already teaching the WSPU to fight back. Her chosen method was the ancient Japanese martial art of jiu-jitsu. It emphasised using the attacker's force against them, channelling their momentum and targeting their pressure points.  The first connection between the suffragettes and jiu-jitsu was made at a WSPU meeting. Garrud and her husband William, who ran a martial arts school in London's Golden Square together, had been booked to attend. But William was ill, so she went alone.  ""Edith normally did the demonstrating, while William did the speaking,"" says Tony Wolf, writer of Suffrajitsu, a trilogy of graphic novels about this aspect of the suffragette movement. ""But the story goes that the WSPU's leader, Emmeline Pankhurst, encouraged Edith to do the talking for once, which she did.""  Garrud began teaching some of the suffragettes. ""At that time it was more about defending themselves against angry hecklers in the audience who got on stage, rather than police,"" says Wolf. ""There had been several attempted assaults.""  By about 1910 she was regularly running suffragette-only classes and had written for the WSPU's newspaper, Votes for Women. Her article stressed the suitability of jiu-jitsu for the situation in which the WSPU found itself - that is, having to deal with a larger, more powerful force in the shape of the police and government.  The press noticed. Health and Strength magazine printed a satirical article called ""Jiu-jitsuffragettes"". Punch magazine showed a cartoon of Garrud standing alone against several policemen, entitled ""The suffragette that knew jiu-jitsu"". The term ""suffrajitsu"" soon came into common use.  ""They wouldn't have expected in those days that women could respond physically to that kind of action, let alone put up effective resistance,"" says Martin Dixon, chairman of the British Jiu-Jitsu Association. ""It was an ideal way for them to handle being grabbed while in a crowd situation.""  The Pankhursts agreed and encouraged all suffragettes to learn the martial art. ""The police know jiu-jitsu. I advise you to learn jiu-jitsu. Women should practice it as well as men,"" said Sylvia Pankhurst, daughter of Emmeline, in a 1913 speech.  As the years went on, confrontations between police and suffragettes became more intense. The so-called Cat and Mouse Act in 1913 allowed hunger-striking prisoners to be released and then re-incarcerated as soon as they had recovered their health.  ""The WSPU felt that as Mrs Pankhurst had such a vital role to play as motivator and figurehead for the organisation that she was too important to be recaptured,"" says Emelyne Godfrey, author of Femininity, Crime and Self-Defence in Victorian Literature and Society.  She needed protectors so Garrud formed a group called The Bodyguard. It consisted of up to 30 women who undertook ""dangerous duties,"" explains Godfrey. ""Sometimes all they would get would be a phone call and instructions to follow a particular car.""  The Bodyguard, nicknamed ""Amazons"" by the press, armed themselves with clubs hidden in their dresses.  They came in handy during a famous confrontation known as the ""Battle of Glasgow"" in early 1914.  The Bodyguard travelled overnight from London by train, their concealed clubs making the journey uncomfortable. A crowd was waiting to see Emmeline Pankhurst speak at St Andrew's Hall. But police had surrounded it, hoping to catch her.  Pankhurst evaded them on her way in by buying a ticket and pretending to be a spectator. The Bodyguard then got into position, sitting on a semi-circle of chairs behind the speaker's podium.  Suddenly Pankhurst appeared and started speaking. She did so for half a minute before police tried to storm the stage.  But they became caught on barbed wire hidden in bouquets. ""So about 30 suffragettes and 50 police were involved in a brawl on stage in front of 4,000 people for several minutes,"" says Wolf.  Eventually police overwhelmed The Bodyguard and Pankhurst was once again arrested. But the difficulty they had in dragging her away showed just how effective her guards had become.  Garrud did not just teach them physical skills. They had also learnt to trick their opponents. In 1914, Emmeline Pankhurst gave a speech from a balcony in Camden Square.  When she emerged from the house in a veil, escorted by members of The Bodyguard, the police swooped in. Despite a fierce fight she was knocked to the ground and dragged away unconscious. But when the police triumphantly unveiled her, they realised she was a decoy. The real Pankhurst had been smuggled out in the commotion.  The emphasis on skill to defeat and outwit a larger opponent was what first impressed Garrud about jiu-jitsu. She came across it when her husband William attended a martial arts exhibition in 1899 and started taking lessons.  BBC iWonder: Beyond suffrage - how did women battle their way into Parliament?  Garrud was soon teaching it herself and became one of the first female martial art instructors in the West. In exhibitions, she would wear a red gown and invite a martial arts enthusiast dressed as a policeman to attack her.  ""As far as the suffragettes were concerned, she was very much in the right place at the right time,"" says Wolf.  ""Jiu-jitsu had become something of a society trend, with women hosting jiu-jitsu parties, where they and their friends underwent instruction.""  Garrud and her jiu-jitsu students continued their fight for the vote until a bigger battle engulfed them all. At the outbreak of WW1, the suffragettes concentrated on helping the war effort.  At the end of the war, in 1918, the Representation of the People Act was finally passed. More than eight million women in the UK were given the vote. But women would not get the same voting rights as men until 1928.  As time passed, The Bodyguard and their trainer began to be forgotten. ""It was the leaders that wrote the books and set the history,"" explains Crawford. The stories of those who helped them were less likely to be recorded.  Edith Garrud does not feature in the new film but one of its stars, Helena Bonham Carter, has paid her own tribute by changing her character's name from Caroline to Edith in her honour.  She was ""an amazing woman"" whose fighting method was not about brute force, Bonham Carter has said. ""It was about skill.""  It was this skill that helped the suffragettes take on powerful opponents. As Garrud recalled in an interview in 1965, a policeman once tried to prevent her from protesting outside Parliament. ""Now then, move on, you can't start causing an obstruction here,"" he said. ""Excuse me, it is you who are making an obstruction,"" she replied, and tossed him over her shoulder.

618,"When she was kidnapped, she had been head of the charity's operations in the country for some 12 years.  Married to an Iraqi, Mrs Hassan has Irish, British and Iraqi nationality.  Her friend Felicity Arbuthnot, a film-maker who has travelled to Iraq to document Mrs Hassan's work, described her as ""an extraordinary woman"".

Robert Glasser, chief executive of Care Australia, said: ""It is important to note that she has been providing humanitarian relief to the most needy Iraqis in a professional career spanning more than 25 years.  ""She has been on the ground helping the poor in Iraq for over 25 years.""  Mrs Hassan warned MPs shortly before last year's war that Iraq could face a humanitarian catastrophe in the event of a conflict.  She said UN sanctions had left the Iraqi people in a worse situation than they had been at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991.  ""The Iraqi people are already living through a terrible emergency,"" she told a House of Commons briefing.  ""They do not have the resources to withstand an additional crisis brought about by military action.""  Mrs Hassan chose to stay in Iraq during the war, and told the Newcastle Journal on the eve of the conflict that she was ""sad"" Britain was taking part.  She added she did not fear being targeted in revenge attacks by Iraqis.  International relief and development charity Islamic Relief, based in Birmingham, joined calls for Mrs Hassan's safe release.  She spoke to its members about Iraq in 2002, before the war, describing how a formerly prosperous nation had been systematically reduced to poverty.  Islamic Relief spokesman Ideel Jafferi said staff prayed for her after her kidnap.  Care International is the world's largest humanitarian relief agency, with a presence in 72 countries.  It has focused efforts in Iraq since the war on providing emergency relief and medical aid, and restoring access to clean water.  More than 30 staff, all Iraqis, work in its Baghdad office."
619,"Aston Villa 2-1 Charlton   Goals either side of the break from defenders Alpay and Jlloyd Samuel gave Aston Villa a 2-1 victory over Charlton.  Thumped 4-1 by Manchester City last time out, David O'Leary's side made amends for that defeat, but with a far from convincing performance.  Alpay volleyed home from close range on 36 minutes before Samuel curled home a delightful second 19 minutes later.  Charlton reduced the deficit through Kevin Lisbie with four minutes left, but failed to get the equaliser they deserved.  Yet the visitors, who had recalled Mark Fish and Luke Young in defence, began the better and could have been two-up midway through the first half.  Then two minutes later, Radostin Kishishev lobbed Villa keeper Thomas Sorensen only to see his cheeky effort end up in the side-netting.  The home side made the most of their lucky escape, breaking the deadlock through Alpay.  The Turkey international, making his first home league start for 11 months because of injuries to Olof Mellberg and Ronny Johnsen, volleyed the ball home from close range after Dean Kiely had failed to collect Lee Hendrie's corner.  Juan Pablo Angel almost doubled Villa's lead on the stroke of half-time when his overhead kick flew just over.  Instead, it was left to defender Samuel to increase the lead after the break.  The left-back was given time and space to roam by the Charlton defence and made the visitors pay by finding the net with a pin-point right-foot shot from 20 yards.  Shaun Bartlett had a goal harshly ruled out by referee Chris Foy before Lisbie, on for the ineffective Di Canio, grabbed a late consolation after a mix-up involving Alpay and Sorensen."

The top US commander in Afghanistan has said al-Qaeda will not be defeated unless its leader, Osama Bin Laden, is captured or killed. Testifying to the US Congress, Gen Stanley McChrystal said Bin Laden had become an ""iconic figure"". He said President Barack Obama's deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant success was possible. But he said the mission was ""undeniably difficult"" and the next 18 months would be crucial. ""I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed,"" said Gen McChrystal of Bin Laden. ""I believe he is an iconic figure at this point, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organisation across the world."" The general said that killing or capturing Bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but that the movement could not be eradicated while Bin Laden remained at large. The militant leader is believed to be living in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates said last week that officials have had no reliable information on Bin Laden's whereabouts for ""years"". Gen McChrystal told the Congressional hearing the next 18 months would be crucial in Afghanistan, but that he did not expect to need more troops to get the job done. He said coalition forces faced ""a complex and resilient insurgency"" and that Afghans lacked confidence in their government. ""Success will require steadfast commitment and incur significant costs,"" he told the House Armed Services Committee. It is said the general only takes one meal a day so maybe he used the lunch hour to reflect that his worries are not the same as those on the Hill who worry more about perceptions of weakness.    The commander said the 30,000 US reinforcements would ""provide us the ability to reverse insurgent momentum and deny the Taliban the access to the population they require to survive"". He said he did not think he would need to ask for any more troops in a year's time, but would not hesitate to recommend more if circumstances changed. The US ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, who questioned the troop build-up during White House deliberations last month, also endorsed the new approach as ""the best path to stabilise Afghanistan"". Mr Eikenberry agreed with Gen McChrystal that Bin Laden was key to that process. He said it was ""important to the American people - indeed, the people of the world - that one day Osama Bin Laden is either captured or killed, brought to justice"". The new battle plan includes an 18-month timeline before the first US troops would begin to come home. Hours before the panel convened, Mr Gates held talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the capital, Kabul. Speaking at a joint news conference afterwards, President Karzai warned that it would take 15 years before Afghanistan was able to pay for the cost of its own security forces, which the US wants to quadruple in size to 400,000 troops by 2013. ""We hope that the international community and the United States, as our first ally, will help Afghanistan reach the ability to sustain a force,"" he said. For his part, Mr Karzai said he hoped the US and the international community would continue funding them, adding the US would not abandon Afghanistan. The two countries would need to be long-term partners, he said. The defence secretary said Mr Karzai needed to take a tougher line on corruption, but added that many ministers were competent and did not need to be replaced when a new cabinet is announced in the coming days. Mr Karzai said he was committed to doing so and that he would inform parliament of the names of a number of proposed ministers. Both men then agreed that it was a priority to strengthen the Afghan security forces in order to help international troops tackle insurgents. But Mr Karzai was also cautiously optimistic that his country would be able to begin taking over responsibility for security in some ""critical"" parts of the country within two years, before taking charge nationwide in five years' time. The president later condemned what his office said was the killing of six civilians in an overnight operation by Nato-led forces in the eastern province of Laghman. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Residents have protested against the reported civilian deaths, which they and provincial officials say number 12. The Nato-led International Security Assistance Force said its troops killed seven militants and detained another four after coming under hostile fire while pursuing a member of the Taliban responsible for suicide bombings in the area. Meanwhile, in a sign of the country's security difficulties, there were reports on Tuesday that Afghan officers had opened fire during a protest by villagers over the deaths of civilians, which they say occurred during a Nato operation. According to one report, the Afghan soldiers fired into the air, but at least one person was killed.     "
621,"By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse in France What could be the oldest lunar calendar ever created has been identified on the walls of the famous, prehistoric caves at Lascaux in France.    They were aware of all the rhythms of nature. Their survival depended on them    The interpretation that symbolic paintings, dating back 15,000 years, show the Moon going through its different phases comes from Dr Michael Rappenglueck, of the University of Munich. The German researcher has previously associated patterns left in the caves with familiar stars and constellations. He now says groups of dots and squares painted among representations of bulls, antelope and horses depict the 29-day cycle of the Earth's satellite. With special permission from French authorities, I went into the Lascaux caves with Dr Rappenglueck to inspect the paintings for myself. It was an opportunity most people would never get - to protect the historic site from unnecessary wear and tear, all visitors now tour a mock-up of the caves, the so-called Lascaux II. ""The secret of understanding these caves,"" Dr Rappenglueck told me as we descended into the dark, ""is to understand the people who painted these walls. ""They painted the sky, but not all of it. Just the parts that were specially important to them."" With eyes becoming adjusted to the half-light, I entered the Chamber of the Bulls and stood there in amazement. Anyone who has seen the paintings on the walls can be left in no doubt that they represent some of the greatest works of art every created. The animals were painted on to the walls of the chamber by Cro-magnon man, one of our close relations, 15,000 years ago. He thrived in a temperate valley in the Dordogne while the rest of Europe was held in the grip of an ice age. As I marvelled at the spectacle, Dr Rappenglueck moved ahead of me. ""Here it is,"" he said, as he headed down the passage. He was pointing to a line of dots painted half way up the wall. ""Count them. Count them."" Below a stunning painting of a deer was a row of 13 dots, ending in a square. ""Why 13?"" I asked. ""It's half of the Moon's monthly cycle,"" Dr Rappenglueck said. ""One dot for each day the Moon is in the sky. At the new Moon, when it vanishes from the sky, we see an empty square, perhaps symbolically representing the absent Moon. ""But there's more, further along."" The Munich researcher gestured to me to move along the passageway. Beneath a dappled, brown horse with a dark mane was another row of dots. This time there were more of them. ""There are 29 of them - one for each day of the Moon's 29-day cycle when it runs through its phases in the sky. It was a rhythm of nature that was important to these people."" Dr Rappenglueck looked around at the bulls, antelope and horses painted on the walls with such obvious admiration. ""They were aware of all the rhythms of nature. Their survival depended on them, they were a part of them."" But there is another puzzle. I pointed to the series of dots that curve away from the main row. ""Why do they do that?"" I enquired. ""I think that indicates the time of the new Moon, when it disappears from the sky for several days,"" said Dr Rappenglueck. There is definitely astronomy on the walls of Lascaux. Earlier this year, Dr Rappenglueck identified a series of constellations painted on the wall of a shaft off the main chamber at Lascaux. The tiny pattern of the Pleiades star cluster can also be seen hanging above the shoulder of a bull near the entrance to the main passageway. We will probably never understand completely what Cro-magnon man had in mind when he painted the Lascaux caves. The images of the animals seem obvious but what are we to make of the geometrical shapes and patterns scattered in between these creatures?"
622,"China is about to try one of the most notorious murders in recent memory.  In late May a group belonging to a banned cult beat a woman to death in a fast food restaurant. Her only crime was to refuse to give them her telephone number.  The cult in question is called the Church of the Almighty God and claims to have millions of members.  It was an ordinary evening in a small town McDonald's in east China until a family of six arrived trying to recruit new members to their Christian cult.  They moved between the tables asking for phone numbers and when one diner refused they beat her to death, screaming at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate.  The savage murder was filmed on closed circuit TV and on mobile phones.  It shocked China. Who were these people prepared to kill over a telephone number?  Interviewed in prison later, one of the murderers, Zhang Lidong, showed no remorse and no fear.  He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her.""  The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse.  The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States.  No one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese.  It states: ""Since the Communist Party came to power in 1949, religious faith has suffered from full-scale crackdown and persecution by the Communist Party - the red dragon - in mainland China.""  Of course it's true that until the late 1970s, Communist China did persecute all religious faith, and even now allows it only within strict guidelines.  There are in fact tens of millions of Chinese Christians whose faith is orthodox but who practice it in illegal underground or ""house"" churches to escape government interference.  But while complaining of Communist persecution, there's no mention on the Church of the Almighty God website of the murders, mutilations, stabbings and riots that some of its own members have been accused of.  Instead it claims millions of followers and says nearly 400,000 have been arrested in the past three years alone.  Resisting the Communist Party, ""the big red dragon"", is a key test of fitness for salvation according to the personal testaments on the website.  One states: ""Even if they beat me to death my soul is still in God's hands. God's word's made my faith firm... I'll never yield to the devil.""  A very different picture emerges from those who have lost family to the cult.  Most don't want to reveal their identity for fear of retribution. We talked to one man who went undercover to rescue his wife and father-in-law.  He said: ""The cult is anti-family, anti-human, anti-government. It is constantly training its members to lie to their husbands and wives. They throw away family relationships and encourage each other to do the same.""  ""Whoever is more resolute in rejecting their family is given a higher rank. It takes people who are kind and makes them crazy and extreme.""  We found many victims through family support websites and heard of a shadowy cell structure where false names and identities make it almost impossible to trace relatives.  A picture emerged of recruiters who start by offering support and move on to intimidation, who persuade new members to hand over money in exchange for salvation, and who sometimes resort to seduction and kidnapping.  Outside a government-sanctioned church in Beijing's university district, there are large black signboards warning congregations to be wary of cult recruiters.  Christianity provides a sense of shared values and community at a time when the Communist Party seems to many Chinese to have stopped trying.  But the cult promises an even closer-knit community and even more direct route to salvation. Its recruiters are skilled at targeting people at times of vulnerability: a major illness in the family, a marriage break up, a job loss.  Already the government-backed church suffers from a steady flow of Christians to the underground churches.  But the cults recruit much more aggressively and Pastor Wu Weiqing said it's hard to hold onto his flock.  He said: ""I very seriously believe in the next 10 years the most serious challenge to the growth of the church would be from heresies and cults.""  ""The cults and the heresies will always have the opportunities to get those people, get their heart and drag them away from us. ""  In an east China cemetery on a hill above vineyards and orchards, Wang Jiannan picks his way carefully between the headstones.  He lost his mother and his sister to the cult nearly 20 years ago. But now he's lost his father too.  On 1 October last year, his sister beat their father to death in a grim forerunner of the McDonald's killing. Like those killers, she saw her victim as a demon who must be destroyed.  She then handed herself into police and is now in prison alongside the McDonald's murderers.  ""My sister has committed the crime and must be punished. But I just want my mother to see clearly the damage the cult has done to her family,"" said Mr Wang.  ""I want her to leave and become a normal person. This is my biggest hope.""  Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase the pressure on the Church of the Almighty God.  Recent weeks have seen an almost daily drip feed of raids and arrests.  But so far the cult has inflicted its damage on individuals and families. Despite its vocal hostility to the Communist Party, it has mobilised no meaningful political threat.  And a threat to the Party, rather than the people, is what it takes to trigger a crackdown in China."
623,"The women were part of a batch of 36 cadets who were awarded flying badges after three years of gruelling training at the PAF academy at Risalpur.  Being a fighter pilot has until now been a purely male domain. Women could join the armed forces but only for non-combat jobs like the medical corps.  Three years ago the PAF decided to allow women to train as fighter pilots.  It was a passing out parade with a difference.  Never before had any woman been part of the batch of fighter pilots being awarded flying badges.  And the difference was recognised by the vice chief of the army, Gen Ahsan Saleem Hayat, who handed out the certificates of honour to the successful men and women cadets.  Expressing his delight, Gen Hayat said the air force had taken the lead to induct women in the combat units of the armed forces.  When the BBC visited the training academy nearly a year ago, the first batch of four women cadets had just moved on to fly jet-engine planes.  There were six others who were in the second batch and a few others in the aerospace unit.  Although these trailblazers were few in number, many instructors admitted their presence was already being felt.  One of the female cadets and now a fighter pilot, Saba Khan, then told the BBC that joining the air force to become a pilot was like a dream come true.  At the passing out, one of the graduating women flying officers, Nadia Gul, received the trophy for best academic achievement along with two of her male colleagues who got trophies for best flying performance and general duties.  The air force academy is still male-dominated, and it is not clear what the real feelings of the male cadets have been to the induction of women into the fighter pilot programme. Officially, most have welcomed the move.  Even so, the fact that four women are now officially fighter pilots is a clear indication that the new policy of opening up the combat units of the Pakistani armed forces for women is here to stay."

They are joined by an 80-strong TV crew of technicians, broadcasters, science and camera experts as Jodrell Bank hosts three nights of stargazing and discussion.  The Lovell Telescope was first built in 1957 and remains one of the biggest and most powerful radio telescopes in the world."
625,"One in three of the 4,000 women questioned by CIET Africa, non-governmental organisation, said they had been raped in the past year.  CIET researchers trying to find ways of arresting the alarming growth in sexual violence in South Africa said they were shocked by the finding.  In a related survey conducted among 1,500 schoolchildren in the Soweto township, a quarter of all the boys interviewed said that 'jackrolling' - a South African term for recreational gang rape - was fun.  More than half the interviewees insisted that when a girl says no to sex she really means yes.  Many of those interviewed also expressed little knowledge about the need to use condoms and to practise safe sex.  The boys' opinions differed markedly from those expressed by schoolgirls, many of whom suggested that they were living in an intolerable sexual environment.  Levels of sexual violence differ across the country.  But BBC Correspondent Greg Barrow, in Johannesburg, says the city - South Africa's largest and its industrial hub - is rapidly emerging as the rape capital of the world.  He says the CIET survey will only serve to reinforce that unwelcome title.  CIET says it will be recommending a new approach to the problem in schools, and among the police and community leaders.  It also hopes to focus on the majority of men who do not rape and establish ways of raising their profile as community role models.  As recently as last week, South Africa's first black test cricketer, Makhaya Ntini, appeared in court on rape charges - to the dismay of those who saw him as a potential role model for young sportspeople.  The survey was released at the same time as the government's latest crime statistics, which reveal that the rates of murder and rape in South Africa had declined slightly during 1998.  The murder rate nevertheless remains at 52 per 100,000 - eight times as high as in the United States.  Car hijackings last year were up by nearly 9% on the previous year's figure, and the statistics also show an increase in the rate of burglary and mugging."
626,"Beetles with antifreeze blood, ants that sprint on scorching sand and spiders that live high up Mount Everest.  These incredible creatures are the extremophiles: animals that survive some of the most inhospitable conditions on Earth, and sometimes even further.  Scientists are amazed by the survival abilities of this motley crew and are currently researching their peculiar adaptations to find out whether they can be transferred to our own species.  In northern Alaska, the red flat bark beetle (Cucujus clavipes) survives arctic conditions using a cocktail of internal chemicals.  The formation of ice crystals in internal fluids is the biggest threat to its survival, but the beetle produces antifreeze proteins that stop water molecules from grouping together.  They also fortify their blood with high concentrations of glycerol, which means that the water in their bodies will not form the ice crystals that would kill other species, even at much milder temperatures.  Professor John Duman from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, US has documented examples of larvae surviving at temperatures of -150 C, for which the antifreeze proteins alone would not be enough.  He explained that what makes these beetles unusual compared with similar species is that they deliberately dehydrate their internal tissues when temperatures fall.  ""This concentrates the antifreezes several fold, such that if they're exposed to really low temperatures their body water then vitrifies [- forms a glass-like substance -] rather than freezing,"" Prof Duman told BBC Nature.  So why do red flat bark beetles live in these conditions?  ""This is the case with any organism able to adapt to extreme environments of any sort: low temperature, high temperature, low oxygen, polluted environments,"" explained Prof Duman.  ""Competition with other species is much reduced, because most species simply can't live in such extreme conditions.""  This is the reason extremophiles thrive in hostile environments: they are exploiting an ecological niche for which they are supremely well-adapted, and face little or no competition within it.  Prof Duman said that the antifreeze proteins in red flat bark beetles are now being investigated for potential applications in cryopreservation and agriculture.  While the red flat bark beetle has adaptations to survive extreme cold, there are also species that thrive in scorching heat.  The desert ants of the Sahara are some of the most heat tolerant species in the world.  The Sahara desert ant (Cataglyphis bicolor) deliberately comes out at the hottest point in the day, when surface temperatures are around 60C and, crucially, restrict their predators' activities.  The ants scavenge for the corpses of insects which have died of heat exposure and although they are physically well developed to resist high temperatures, they could still die from heat exposure within minutes.  They survive because they only stay out for short periods. They have long legs and move quickly with as little contact with the sand as possible to stop the heat from building up in their bodies.  Finding food in an environment which does not support life is a difficulty also experienced by the Himalayan jumping spider (Euophrys omnisuperstes), which lives at heights of up to 6700m: higher than any other species.  This means there are no prey species for the spider to hunt, but the environment solves this problem: the wind blows frozen insects up the mountain for the spider to catch.  Out of this world  While adaptation to a single harsh habitat is impressive, there are species which can survive a variety: the rarer polyextremophiles.  Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are tiny, eight legged animals which can survive extremes of heat and cold, low pressure and even high levels of radiation.  They have even survived exposure to space and as such are the undisputed champions of extreme environments.  Ingemar Jonsson, Associate Professor at Kristianstad University, is a specialist in tardigrade biology.  When asked what he considered their most impressive ability, he said: ""Their ability to dehydrate completely when the surrounding conditions dry out, and stay in that state without any metabolism for many years or even decades, is clearly remarkable.""  The way that tardigrades perform this drying-out act, however, is still a mystery.  ""We know that the animal must somehow protect its basic cell structures from collapsing when water is withdrawn, and repair the damage that arises, but how this is done is unclear,"" Prof Jonsson.  Just like red flat bark beetles, dehydration protects tardigrades from freezing when the temperature drops, as their desiccated cells are safe from ice crystal formation.  In December 2012, researchers reported observations of tardigrades able to survive being cooled to just over absolute zero, less than -270C.  They also have amazing radiation resistance: they are able to survive a thousand times more radiation than would prove fatal to humans. Again, this is due to their remarkable healing talent.  ""We believe that the ability to repair damaged DNA is one of the main components of this system,"" said Prof Jonsson, whose recent studies have been focused on these mechanisms.  ""Finding out how this works would be a breakthrough for our knowledge on tardigrades, but it would also be of considerable interest for many other fields of biology and medicine where DNA repair play a central role.""  So while understanding these creatures is of interest in itself, future human benefits may also come from studies of how the extremophiles survive in the supposedly inhospitable parts of our universe.  Extremophiles feature in the BBC Four programme Insect Worlds: The Secret of their Success on Wednesday 27 March at 2030 GMT."
627,"Artificial intelligence can identify skin cancer in photographs with the same accuracy as trained doctors, say scientists.  The Stanford University team said the findings were ""incredibly exciting"" and would now be tested in clinics.  Eventually, they believe using AI could revolutionise healthcare by turning anyone's smartphone into a cancer scanner.  Cancer Research UK said it could become a useful tool for doctors.  The AI was repurposed from software developed by Google that had learned to spot the difference between images of cats and dogs.  It was shown 129,450 photographs and told what type of skin condition it was looking at in each one.  It then learned to spot the hallmarks of the most common type of skin cancer: carcinoma, and the most deadly: melanoma.  Only one in 20 skin cancers are melanoma, yet the tumour accounts for three-quarters of skin cancer deaths.  The experiment, detailed in the journal Nature, then tested the AI against 21 trained skin cancer doctors.  One of the researchers, Dr Andre Esteva, told the BBC News website: ""We find, in general, that we are on par with board-certified dermatologists.""  However, the computer software cannot make a full diagnosis, as this is normally confirmed with a tissue biopsy.  Dr Esteva said the system now needed to be tested alongside doctors in the clinic.  ""The application of AI to healthcare is, we believe, an incredibly exciting area of research that can be leveraged to achieve a great deal of societal good,"" he said.  ""One particular route that we find exciting is the use of this algorithm on a mobile device, but to achieve this we would have to build an app and test its accuracy directly from a mobile device.""  Incredible advances in machine-learning have already led to AI beating one of humanity's best Go players.  And a team of doctors in London have trained AI to predict when the heart will fail.  Dr Jana Witt, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: ""Using artificial intelligence to help diagnose skin cancer is very interesting, as it could support assessments by GPs and dermatologists.  ""It's unlikely that AI will replace all of the other information your clinician would consider when making a diagnosis, but AI could help guide GP referrals to specialists in the future.""  Brett Kuprel, another researcher on the project, added: ""The end-to-end training and transfer learning approaches we used can be applied to many problems in healthcare, provided there is a large enough dataset.  ""It could transform treatment in ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology."""
628,"The giving and receiving of gifts is a diplomatic tool    It's a story you think you know through and through. But how often does it turn out that in the retelling, a crucial detail has been misremembered? Once again a listener has set me off on a productive train of thought. A small correction has prompted me to reflect on the way that we historians, in the very act of reaching out to recover the forgotten connections between ourselves and our forebears, run the risk of overlooking what is right under our noses. But I begin with a little known story retrieved from the archives, that sheds some intriguing light on a piece of long-buried Elizabethan history. In the Beyazit Devlet Library in Istanbul is a document in Turkish, which contains an account of an exchange of gifts between the rulers of England and the Ottoman Empire in the 1590s: ""During the sultanate of Murad [it runs], the ruler of [England] was, it is said, a woman, Queen of a sizeable kingdom. This person, in order to approach the Abode of Majesty and the shadow of its protection, sent [Sultan Murad] as a gift a masterpiece of craftsmanship, a clock."" Being one of those who can recover glimpses of the past from the glorious relics among the records carries with it responsibilities    The so-called clock was in fact a highly ornate clockwork organ, ""a work of art, studded with jewels"" on which, according to the manuscript, the skilled technicians who accompanied the gift ""laboured for many years, toiling to complete and perfect it"". And although Elizabeth I intended it for Murad III, by the time the organ had completed the long sea voyage from London in 1599, it was his son Mehmed III who received it enthusiastically, and had it assembled and tuned in the seraglio for the entertainment of his harem. Mehmed responded with lavish gifts in the Turkish style. Their glamorous gifts to one another were part of a deliberate policy of cementing cordial relations between the countries. England and the Ottoman Empire had signed an agreement in 1581, granting English merchants preferential trading rights in the region, superior to any currently in existence with other European nations. Now, it was hoped that an Anglo-Turkish alliance might play a key role in creating an effective East-West force, to divide the military focus of the dominant and aggressively expansionist European power, Catholic Spain. There are to be found in your kingdom rare distilled waters of every kind for the face and odiferous oils for the hands    A generation later, however, the more austerely Islamic sultan Ahmed I had the clockwork organ destroyed. Nothing remains to tell us of its existence, except the documents in Turkish, Italian and English filed away in archives in London and Istanbul. While this story is remarkable as a cordial 16th Century exchange between the Protestant West and Islamic East, it has a yet more unexpected sequel. The musical mechanical marvel was not the only gift delivered to the court of Mehmed III. There was also a fine ceremonial coach, which was presented, with an accompanying personal letter from Queen Elizabeth herself, to the Sultan's mother, the Albanian-born Walide Safiye, who had enormous influence over the Sultan. The Sultana was delighted. She wrote an effusive thank you letter to Elizabeth in Turkish, in which she promised to use her best endeavours to ensure that her son stood by the treaty of cooperation he had signed with England: ""May you, too, always be firm in friendship! God willing, it will never fail."" Accompanying the letter was her own gift - a robe, a girdle, a sleeve, two gold-embroidered handkerchiefs, three towels, and a crown studded with pearls and rubies. These were the formal communication and gifts to go through official channels. But delightfully, Walide Safiye sent a second, less formal letter, written in Italian on her behalf by her entrepreneurial ""Kira"" - or intermediary - between the harem and the outside world, Esperanza Malchi, an Italian Jew (a woman one of the English delegation described as ""a short, fat trubkin""). ""On account of Your Majesty's being a woman,"" she wrote, the Sultana could without embarrassment ask a personal favour. Would the English Queen send her some English cosmetics, the renown of which had reached Istanbul. ""There are to be found in your kingdom rare distilled waters of every kind for the face and odiferous oils for the hands. Your Majesty would favour me by sending some of them by my hand for this most serene Queen; by my hand as, being articles for ladies, she does not wish them to pass through other hands."" This long-distance relationship between an English Queen and a Turkish Sultana was short-lived. In 1600 there was a coup in Istanbul in the course of which Esperanza Malchi was murdered. Three years later, England was ruled by a Scotsman, King James I. Nevertheless, this extraordinary sequence of documents - all to be found in the original and in contemporary Italian translations in the British Library in London - is evidence of contact and understanding between Eastern Islam and Western Protestantism long before most people would expect. Archival jewels like these Turkish letters have lain undiscovered for centuries in national and local libraries across Britain. No wonder the National Council on Archives - which campaigns for ""archives awareness"" - maintains that the nation's collections of historical documents ultimately contain everything we could possibly want to know about ourselves. In themselves, however, documents are effectively lost, unless they are reawakened by the attention and skill of an historian. It was only in the 1960s that the distinguished Ottomanist scholar Susan Skilliter brought the Turkish letters in the British library to more general historical attention. And being one of those who can recover glimpses of the past from the glorious relics among the records carries with it responsibilities. It was while I was working on this story that a courteous e-mail arrived from Dr Rozina Visram, pointing out a piece of misremembering on my part in my last Point of View column. It made me rush off to the library of the Warburg Institute in London, to check that I had remembered the Ottoman Kira, Esperanza Malchi's letter correctly, and to retranscribe its detail. Others may already have noticed the slip I made in the course of telling the story of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. I remarked in an aside that Ramanujan was the first Indian national to have been made a Fellow of the Royal Society. And I wrote that sentence while sitting at my desk within the Royal Society's Library, with the entire resources of its almost 350 years of archives and records at my disposal. Had I thought to check what I had, I believe, always been told, I would have found in a matter of minutes that Ramanujan was not the first but the second Indian national to become a Royal Society Fellow. The Parsi engineer Ardaseer Cursetjee from Bombay had been elected to a Fellowship almost 80 years earlier on 27 May 1841. His nomination paper (lodged in the society's archive) describes him as a ""gentleman well versed in the theory and practice of Naval Architecture and devoted to scientific pursuits"", and it credits him with having ""built a [sea-going] Vessel of 60 tons to which he adapted a Steam Engine"" and introducing gas street lighting in Bombay. The incident reminded me of the fragility of the jigsaw of human history we reassemble from its scattered documentary pieces. The 16th Century Ottoman Sultan's presents and letters belong to distant times and places. Recovering them requires all of our endeavours. Yet while we historians extend our efforts to try to give the past the depth and global reach needed to explain Britain's rich diversity today, our history closer to home may get forgotten. Dr Visram assured me in her e-mail that my error was ""not of much consequence, and does not in any way detract from what you were saying"". Perhaps so. But it is a timely reminder to those of us toiling in the archives that while we labour to recover the overlooked from the disparagement of history, we must also always take care not to be forgetful ourselves.    Below is a selection of your comments. Welcome to the 21st century. The days of skills being rated by what is remembered are long gone - there's simply too much to remember. What you have to do now is make use of new technology to make this information available at your fingertips and then use your knowledge to find it quickly and accurately. Google and Wikipedia are the start, people like you who can see the shortcomings of the traditional system need to build on them.   Mike Birch, USA (ex-UK) This article maginificently shows the failings of the present Technology. The electronic storing of information is totally dependant on someone putting that information on the system in the first place, accurately. Information is absolutely useless if you cannot retrieve it. The present Technology also does not take into account the human diversity of enquiry. We are all different.  Ian Townley, Hampton, England Elementary legal training in Scotland........at least when I graduated in or around 1953!!!i.e always check facts.........however certain we maybe.  Frederick Levine, Glsgow, Scotland There is so much that society has forgotten it is unbelievable. I came across a passage in Andre Gide's novel - The Counterfeiters. A character has survived a shipwreck. One of the great passenger liners. She remarks that the officer in each lifeboat had a knife or cleaver which they would use to cut off the hands or fingers of anyone trying to climb aboard the already overladen lifeboats as too many people would sink the boats. This is a tiny piece of history we have conveniently forgotten. You won't see it in films about the Titannic. There is so much like that, and the sort of thing that I love, and so few historians.   Pete, Leeds Insightful and intriguing article. I suspect that the majority would say history has no relevance. You may have begun the argument that it certainly does, and that it therefore merits greater study by a greater number, starting with our own history in these Isles.  Dr C. James Bacon, Abingdon, Oxfordshire Being a historical linguist, I am well aware of the difficulties involved in having little details of a story wrong. Sometimes, however, it is quite the other way to: Many years ago I used to stay at a small hotel in Ebury Street, London. Years later I came back to Ebury Street just to see it again. I remembered the hotel being on one side of the street, and a wine bar being on the other, a little further along at a corner. To my surprise, the hotel was no longer there - or rather, there was a hotel there, but with a different name. I enquired, and found that this had been 'my' hotel; it had removed to the other side of the street, and the current hotel had moved in. My memory was correct after all, which was a relief!  D. Fear, Heidelberg, Germany The mistake is fully understandable. But, it does give one pause to consider the vastly greater and more numerous opportunities to err in the historical records from times much earlier when the facts of history were transferred in the oral tradition, there being no scripts for encoding the phonemes, words, phrases, sentences, and grammatical structures of languages. And so, today, we are living with the fallout -- great tales of dubious prophets wrapped in cohesive but illogical and conflicting packages known as religion.   Scott MacKenzie     "
629,"Italy coach Cesare Prandelli says he is going to resign after the four-time champions were knocked out of the World Cup in Brazil on Tuesday.  He saw his side exit in the group stages for the second successive World Cup after the 1-0 defeat by Uruguay.  Prandelli, 56, took over the Azzuri after the unsuccessful 2010 tournament and led them to the final of Euro 2012.  ""I chose a certain technical plan and that's why I am resigning, because it did not work,"" he said.  ""Something has changed since my contract was renewed. I don't know why.""  Prandelli only signed a new deal in May taking him up to Euro 2016.  ""I talked to the president of the federation and vice president Demetrio Albertini and gave my resignation,"" added Prandelli. ""It is irrevocable.""  Despite losing to Costa Rica in their second game, the Italians only needed a point to progress to the last 16 thanks to an opening Group D 2-1 victory over England.  But Diego Godin's late header, after Luis Suarez had escaped punishment for an apparent bite on Italy defender Girorgio Chiellini, sent Uruguay through to the last 16.  Abete said: ""I would like to announce my resignation. I do hope that at the forthcoming meeting of the board they can persuade Cesare to reconsider his position."""
630,"Conservative shadow cabinet member John Bercow has resigned over the party's opposition to allowing unmarried couples - heterosexual and gay - to adopt children.  Mr Bercow, shadow pensions minister, stepped down from Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith's front bench arguing it was an issue of conscience.  Mr Duncan Smith is imposing a three line whip on the vote - but former leadership challenger Michael Portillo is expected to be among Tory MPs who defy those orders.  Tory chairman Theresa May denied that the decision to oppose the change to adoption rules was another case of the Conservatives being the ""nasty party"".  She said that it was motivated by the desire to provide the most stable future possible for children being adopted.  Married couples were likely to stay together longer than unmarried couples, she said, and therefore provided a more stable background.  People were interested in the adoption issue, she insisted, not the politics behind the Tory voting orders.  Earlier, Mr Portillo told BBC Radio 4's Start The Week: ""The Conservatives in this country are presently inconsistent.  ""They do not maintain a message about their belief that people should be free to lead their private lives on their own terms,"" he said.  Amid rumour of plotting against Mr Duncan Smith, Mr Portillo ruled himself out from ever standing for the leadership again.  Mr Bercow is the first person to resign from Iain Duncan Smith's shadow cabinet over a matter of policy.  In his resignation letter Mr Bercow said extending the pool of potential adopters ""would allow more of our most damaged children to have the chance of a secure and loving home with two parents who share responsibility for them"".  Mr Bercow continued: ""I agree with the case for reform and it is a great pity that Conservative MPs are not to be given a free vote.""  While he ""reluctantly"" stayed away last time the issue came before the Commons ""I really do not wish to do so again"", he said.  ""Instead, I shall speak in the debate - if I am called - and shall vote in favour of change.  ""For this reason, and this reason alone, I am stepping down from the shadow cabinet.""  It is understood that there was a row at the recent shadow cabinet meeting where the party line was decided.  Mr Bercow was the most vociferous supporter of the liberal amendments with David Davis and Michael Howard being the staunchest defenders of the status quo.  Other social liberals who have abstained in Commons votes on the adoption issue include Tim Yeo and Damian Green.  Former shadow cabinet ministers Andrew Mackay and Andrew Lansley are others who have expressed their disquiet over the voting orders.  A new Mori opinion poll suggests 44% of people think gay and lesbian couples in stable, long term relationships should be allowed to adopt.  According to the poll, 36% are opposed to the idea, with 20% undecided.  Mori interviewed 1,836 adults in 187 areas of the UK between 5 and 10 September.  Shadow Home Secretary Oliver Letwin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""very sad"" that Mr Bercow had felt it necessary to resign.  He said he did not want ""to bash or discriminate"" against anybody.  Instead, Mr Letwin saw the Conservative position as one which would best protect children by placing them with parents who had the greatest chance of remaining as a couple.  Asked about whether Mr Duncan Smith had been right to impose a three line whip, Mr Letwin said it was ""a very, very difficult judgement"".  He said there had been a compromise to make it a ""soft"" three line whip - with those opposed to the party line allowed to be elsewhere on ""important business"" on that day.  Mr Duncan Smith has refused to be drawn on possible punishment for rebels, insisting ""only a few"" were opposed to his strategy.  He added that heterosexual couples who were ""serious"" about adoption could always get married."
631,"The shootings on Sunday have left the small town of Crandon, in the north of the Midwestern state, in shock.  The gunman, named as Tyler Peterson, 20, worked full-time as a deputy sheriff in Forest County.  As well as his ex-girlfriend, he shot two childhood friends and a 14-year-old girl. His motive is not yet known.  Police Chief John Dennee said Peterson, who also worked as a part-time police officer, was not on duty at the time of the shooting.  The incident occurred at his ex-girlfriend's house shortly before 0300 local time (0800 GMT), where the young people had gathered to watch movies and eat pizza, reports said.  A seventh youth is said to be in critical condition in hospital.  Residents of Crandon, a community of 2,000 about 225 miles (360 kilometres) north of Milwaukee, were ordered to stay in their homes while police hunted for Peterson.  At about 3pm local time he was ""brought down by a sniper"", Crandon Mayor Gary Bradley said.  ""There is probably nobody in Crandon who is not affected by this,"" Mr Peters said, adding that students would be especially affected.  ""They are going to wake up in shock and disbelief and a lot of pain.""  Jenny Stahl, whose 14-year-old daughter Lindsay was the youngest victim, said she had thought the teenager would be safer staying at a friend's house than travelling home late at night.  ""I'm waiting for somebody to wake me up right now. This is a bad, bad dream,"" Mrs Stahl said.  Bud Evans, an elder at Crandon Praise Chapel, told BBC News 24 that worried relatives had gathered at the church as they waited for news.  ""If there's five or six children or kids, young adults, whatever, involved in this, I'd know every one of them - the community's that small and that tight-knit,"" Mr Evans said.  The incident comes only six months after the Virginia Tech campus shooting, in which more than 30 people were killed."
632,"The UK's nuclear submarine refit base is to remain in special measures amid safety concerns.  The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has also warned Devonport in Plymouth might need enhanced monitoring until 2020 unless improvements are made.  Special measures, including monthly inspections, were predicted to last two years when first imposed in 2013.  Babcock, which carries out the refitting for the Ministry of Defence, said safety was its ""highest priority"".  The ONR said its ""enhanced regulatory attention"" meant the once-a-month inspections of HMNB Devonport had ""more effort and managerial attention"".  Its latest annual report blames safety concerns on ""ageing facilities"" and ""increasing demands"" as well as ""stretched resources"" for an unscheduled refuelling of HMS Vanguard later this year.  Last December, Babcock was warned of legal action after a worker received a dose of radiation amid a series of safety breaches.  When Devonport was first placed under special measures in 2013, the ONR said the base was ""expected to receive enhanced regulatory attention for around two years, as we anticipate the issues to be resolved during that time"".  It added with ""sustained commitment over the next three to five years"", Devonport ""has the potential to move to a routine attention position"".  Peter Burt, of the Nuclear Information Service, said: ""The nuclear safety improvements required at Devonport have not been completed within the expected two year timescale, and we will apparently have to wait for several more years before the situation improves.  ""Babcock is clearly unable to deliver the improvements it is being paid to complete. It is time for the MoD to cancel the current management contract for the dockyard and bring the site under the control of a new, competent management team.""  Babcock said in a statement: ""The continued safety of our operations at Devonport remains the highest priority.  ""We have developed a comprehensive long term safety improvement programme to address the points raised by ONR. That work is progressing to plan and has the full visibility of the regulators.""  The Ministry of Defence said: ""Safety at HM Naval Base Devonport, as with all Ministry of Defence sites, is of paramount importance.  ""The MoD supports Babcock's commitment to address the issues raised in the report, and we continue to work together to deliver the necessary investments at Devonport, which includes a site-wide nuclear safety programme with sustained commitment over the coming years."""
633,"Scientology has fought many battles to keep its secrets off the web, now they are using it to attack my investigation into them.  Scientology has prepared an attack video, and they have shown the Scientology v Sweeney shouting match to anyone who would watch it.  There is talk of 100,000 copies being released.  Scientology works. That is the message from celebs like John Travolta and Tom Cruise - who is, some say, keen on recruiting new Hollywood arrivals David and Victoria Beckham to what he calls his religion.  Others back the Church in various ways: Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley of the City of London police helped open a new £20 million Scientology centre in London, and the authorities in the City of London have granted it cut-price rates.  But start asking questions and you see a different face of Scientology.  While making our BBC Panorama film ""Scientology and Me"" I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a ""bigot"" by star Scientologists and been chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers.  Back in Britain strangers have called on my neighbours, my mother-in-law's house and someone spied on my wedding and fled the moment he was challenged.  I have met mothers who say they have suffered Scientology ""disconnects"" - meaning that their children have cut them completely out of their life so that they can spend more time with an organisation which a judge in 1984 characterised as ""corrupt, sinister and dangerous"".  Scientology has two faces - nice and smiley, and sinister and dark. If you do not believe me, go and see their exhibition in Los Angeles, Psychiatry: Industry of Death. You enter through a door that is a mock-up of a torture chamber.  Scientologists want ""the global obliteration"" of psychiatrists, who they say were to blame for the rise of Nazi Germany.  To prove their point, they showed me hideous images of people having needles stuffed in their eyeballs, of patients undergoing electric shocks and having their brains operated on.  Sickening, nasty and wholly unconvincing - modern psychiatry, for all its faults, is not Nazi and to press the point in the way that Scientology does devalues the horror of the Holocaust.  Ironically or not, it was in the ""Mind Control"" section of the exhibition that I lost it.  As often in life, I snapped over something completely different and quite trivial.  Top Scientologist Tommy ""Don't mention the word cult"" Davis had been goading me all week, and on the seventh day I fell into his elephant trap. He shouted at me and I shouted back, louder.  If you are interested in becoming a TV journalist, it is a fine example of how not to do it. I look like an exploding tomato and shout like a jet engine and every time I see it makes me cringe.  I apologised almost immediately, Tommy carried on as if nothing had happened but meanwhile Scientology had rushed off copies of me losing it to my boss, my boss's boss and my boss's boss's boss, the Director-General of the BBC.  I lost my voice, but not my mind.  This is the context Scientology will not tell you about. I have met too many good people who say Scientology was founded by a liar, L Ron Hubbard; that it attacks its critics without mercy; and the celebrities who endorse it have not the foggiest idea what it is really like.  Take ""Rosemary"", who is an ordinary mum and lives in England. She had two children and one died. Her surviving daughter was also her best friend. Then her daughter joined Scientology and her mother saw less and less of her.  Almost two years ago she received a ""disconnect"" - a letter cutting her mother out of her life totally.  Rosemary received no Christmas cards, no birthday cards, no Mother's Day cards.  Rosemary said Scientology was a cult. It was one of the most moving and shocking interviews I have ever done.  Out of the blue, three hours after we left, her daughter came round for the first time in almost two years seeking a reconciliation. The next day she begged her mum not to use the interview. So we won't.  Pay as you go  In Florida I met Mike Henderson, who with his wife Donna Shannon, spent $1m over three decades on Scientology's path to superhuman powers. When the couple left, they were disconnected from 20-odd family members left inside Scientology.  Mike's father - also disconnected - is dying, but five out of his six children will not speak to him because they are still inside Scientology.  After a long day with Mike and Donna we went back to our hotel at midnight, only to find Tommy Davis waiting in the lobby with his own black-clad Scientology cameraman.  He harangued me for talking to the heretics. I told him that Scientology had been spying on the BBC and that was creepy.  In LA, the moment our hire car left the airport we realised we were being followed by two cars.  In our hotel a weird stranger spent every breakfast listening to us. In all, we count 13 strangers - private investigators? - who were following us. Scientology denied sending PIs after the BBC.  Scientology is a pay-as-you-go religion - which is one of the reasons why the Charity Commission in Britain does not class it as a religion.  When you have paid as much as £100,000, you get to Operating Thetan Level Three and learn about ""The Incident"".  L Ron wrote that 75 million years ago an intergalactic space alien lord called Xenu kidnapped Thetans to earth, dumped them in volcanoes and blew them up with atomic bombs.  Critics say that if we all knew about Xenu, then Scientology could not charge people as much as £100,000 to find out about him.  Despite all the pressure - the letters from lawyers, the letters from MPs, the strangers knocking up my family and neighbours - if people from ""disconnected"" families tell me that Scientology is a cult, that will be reported."
634,"People in Staines forced to leave their homes in February when a nearby river flooded want Surrey County Council to chase Thames Water for compensation.  Residents blame the River Ash floods on a delay by Thames Water in closing a sluice gate which would have diverted the water.  They said the council should help recover costs, but it said Thames Water was the responsibility of Ofwat.  Thames Water said it was sorry people felt its actions worsened the flooding.  The residents say water spilled into the River Ash because a sluice gate on the Thames Water aqueduct was not closed.  They were told to evacuate their homes on 10 February but Thames Water was not ordered by Surrey ""gold control"" flood planning group to close the sluice gate until two days later.  Martin Cherrett, leader of the River Ash Action Group, said residents expected the county council to take a lead role in getting them compensation.  ""There is a lot of frustration,"" he said.  ""There are a lot of people still not back in their houses.  ""It is by no means over as far as the local residents are concerned.""  Councillor John Furey said Thames Water did not have to answer to the local authority.  ""The only people who can affect their performance and the outcome of this is Ofwat,"" he said.  Thames Water said its teams worked tirelessly during the flooding to help residents.  ""This included keeping floodwater away from nearby homes by increasing the rate at which they pumped water from the aqueduct channel out into our reservoirs,"" it said in a statement.  ""We are genuinely sorry residents feel the decision to operate the sluice gate worsened the flooding.  ""We're working alongside the Environment Agency to update our River Ash protocol and we will be sharing this with the action group."""

""Robbie Savage has been fined the maximum permissible two weeks' wages,"" said a Leicester spokesman.  ""Leicester City were made aware of the incident on Saturday evening by match referee Graham Poll and then conducted their own investigation.

636,"The widely-anticipated move was announced by the Bank of Japan at the end of a two-day meeting.  The move signals the Bank's confidence in the strength of the Japanese economy, which has seen accelerating growth and falling unemployment.  The rate increase also marks a significant shift in monetary policy, away from tackling deflation.  Economists said the move represented a watershed as consumer price rises, allied to strong economic performance, have pushed Japan out of the deflationary spiral of recent years.  The Bank of Japan was under significant pressure after ministers warned that any precipitous move on rates could stop the country's resurgent economy in its tracks.  In response, the Bank said it would keep rates ""very low"" for some time and would only increase them gradually.  ""Today's decision will contribute to ensuring price stability and achieving sustainable growth in the medium and to long term,"" the Bank said after its unanimous decision.  The move comes against the backdrop of growing evidence that Japan's economy has turned the corner.  Output has grown in each of the past five quarters while unemployment has fallen to an eight-year low of 4%.  The government recently upgraded its annual growth forecast for the current year to more than 2%.  Interest rates have been rising across the industrialised world, with the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank both acting in recent months to contain inflationary pressures.  But Japanese ministers are nervous after what was seen as premature rate rise in 2000 led to an prolonged economic downturn.  Finance minister Sadakazu Tanigaki has said repeatedly he does not believe the time is right for a rise in rates.  Analysts welcomed the move, arguing that economic conditions were a lot more favourable than in 2000 when rates were last increased.  ""The Bank of Japan is more than confident that this is the right time to do it,"" said Sikuho Takeshita, from Mizuho International.  ""This time around what you are seeing is a sustained recovery through domestic growth.""  But Japanese shares fell on Friday as oil prices hit a record $78 a barrel over fears of wider instability in the Middle East following intensified attacks by Israel on Lebanon.

637,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Wales has become the first nation in the UK to go fully digital in its television signal. The Wenvoe transmitter and its relay stations, serving 649,000 homes in south east Wales, started switching from analogue to digital at midnight. Digital UK, which manages the switch, said the last relay station, at Tonyrefail in Rhondda Cynon Taf, shut off analogue in mid afternoon. The weather has delayed the conversion of a transmitter near Pontypool. While Digital UK says it the switchover has gone well, there are issues along the border with England. BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said more viewers in English counties bordering Wales may find Welsh TV channels appearing on their sets, and vice versa. I think this is the best thing the government has ever done for disabled and old people    The switchover in Wales began in August in Swansea, which became the first fully digital city in the country. Mid and north Wales followed, with the south east the last to be converted. The Wenvoe transmitter and its 75 relay stations cover a large area including Cardiff, Newport, Monmouth, Merthyr Tydfil, Brecon and Rhondda Cynon Taf. The transmitter has ceased broadcasting BBC One, ITV1 and S4C in analogue. Tonyrefail in Rhondda Cynon Taf was the final place in Wales to complete the digital switch. Viewers using Freeview, BT Vision and Top-up TV had to retune their sets and anyone who has not switched to digital will lose their television service. The switch to digital is being managed by Digital UK, which said before the process began that one in three people in Wales could not receive Freeview services. Emyr Hughes, Digital UK's national manager for Wales, said: ""Wenvoe is the last of them but is the biggest by far. Wenvoe with its relays covers more than half of all homes in Wales."" Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. He said the digital switch had been a long process but had gone well, with 98.4% of households in Wales - and the UK - having digital television after the switch. The others did not have analogue television to start with, he added. ""It's been fine. Most people managed it without any difficulty at all. There was quite high satellite coverage in Wales to start with,"" he said. ""I can't think of any instances where there's people who were unhappy with digital television but there were some people who found it a bit more challenging because they had unusual equipment, or elderly people who needed a bit more support."" Meanwhile, security-checked installers have been visiting homes to fit digital equipment. Their services are being made available under the BBC-run Switchover Help Scheme for disabled and elderly viewers. The project offers help to eligible disabled and elderly viewers who cannot afford digital equipment and advises those who are finding the switchover difficult. Anthony Lyons, 56, who received free digital equipment, said: ""For people like myself who are in a wheelchair or are disabled or elderly, this scheme is absolutely fantastic for people who can't afford to pay for a digibox. ""We have got the full range of 131 channels. I think this is the best thing the government has ever done for disabled and old people. ""Now people can stay in their house if they can't get out or if they are waiting for a carer and they can watch television with a mixture of channels. ""For people like myself, this will make their lives better."" Age concern groups have voiced concern that elderly people are being encouraged to buy expensive equipment for the switchover. ""A lot of people are under the impression that you need a brand new television or aerial,"" said Iwan Rhys Roberts, spokesman for the merged charity Age Concern Cymru and Help the Aged in Wales. He said: ""All people need is a digibox. As long as your existing aerial was working before it should work after switchover"". Elderly people and their relatives have been advised to speak to Digital UK or an Age Concern Cymru group if they have any questions. • S4C has announced that it is to launch a new High Definition channel. S4C Clirlun will be rolled out across south and west Wales from 30 April, with the remainder of the country able to view it by July. The Digital UK helpline is 08456 50 50 50 (08458 48 48 48 for Welsh speakers). Well we had the switch over some months ago, all went well and we can pick up a load of channels for free, although I just use my Sky Box as its easier to be honest. And Rich, just to put you right, the BBC has it right, Wales is a nation, hence the 6 nations rugby ;) but the whole of the UK is country, not the different parts of it.  Craig, Swansea, Wales All this digital turn over may all be well and good but what about all the people that can't afford the equipment,,, there left with a few channels and left paying £100+ for a colour tv license for a few channels,, our country is useless when it comes to public appreciation the government need to pull together and get there thumbs out of there arses.  Michael Bassett, Clacton On Sea The one annoying thing about digital is the picture is all or nothing. I can watch an analogue fuzzy picture without too much problem, but if it was digital I would see nothing  Gerry, Newport For weeks and weeks there were signs all around the town and leaflets through the door telling us to be ready for the digital switchover in our area. The date came and went, nothing changed. Why? Because our area gets its signal from BBC Midlands, not BBC Wales. So its just been a waste of money so far. It's another year before us on Midlands telly need to go digital.   Tim, Wrexham, Wales I have lots of channels ,many of no interest at all like QVC. More annoyingly I have Welsh news programmes and can't seem to get other local news ( the West) which I'd prefer   squirrel, pontyclun I can only get a small selection of the channels. I now need to go by a digital ariel. Just feels like I am being taxed to watch tv even though I have a license.cost cost cost  Anthony, chippenham You lot above are what is wrong with the UK, you moan for moanings sake!   tomski, The dominant signal here in England, is Wales. The English stations are so weak as to be frequently unwatchable as they are so pixilated. It is very annoying as I can't receive local news & programmes, only Welsh. Now it is going to get worse.  J. Malpas, Chester, England It's hardly surprising that the BBC has sponsored an initiative to ensure that people continue to receive TV... and so continue to pay their TV licence! I'm on Sky so no issues, but if I lost a truckload of channels on switchover, I'd just stop paying my TV licence until the situation was resolved. Simple.  Jim, Yeovil Change for changes sake as per usual and as per usual nothing goes smoothly. All the time they have had to plan this and they still don't get it right. If they can't provide a decent service where by all get the full benefits of freeview we should be paying less for our licences.  Mark Holland, bristol Unsurprisingly the only channels I receive now are the BBC channels. Odd that the organisation championing the process is the only organisation I can now get. Convenient.  Stephen, Caerphilly Since last upgrade ive lost about 15channels on freeview.Main ones itv4 film4 yesterday receptn on channel 4 not as good tuned to Sutton Coldfield.How can i regain these channels.  D.Tudor, Wolverhampton I purchased the BBC Digital Box and I only receive about 12 Channels. What about the rest of them BBC.  gaffa, Glanconwy, Wales I have just watched with the usual feeling of annoyance your item covering the digital switchover in Wales entitled ""Wales becomes first UK digital TV nation with switch"" Why do you perpetuate the myth that you need a new television receiver to view these extra channels? Your report showed a dear older lady trying to get to grips with a new, presumably LCD set when with a £20 set top she could still be using her previous TV. Not only does this encourage the disposal of perfectly serviceable TV receivers with all the hazardous materials issues, it does little for the UK balance of payments!! As a public broadcaster please be a little more responsible with your reports.  Graham Rendell, Guildford, Surrey No problem with rescanning my box this morning but only picked up 17 channels. That's the problem with living in the Valley's!  Ian Dugmore, Newbridge The Wenvoe (Wales) digital power has now gone up to 100,000 Kw from 5000Kw. On 7th April Mendip (West) goes fully digital & power rises tenfold as well. After this date you may need to do manual downloads to put your regional channels back in their right places if you watch news etc from both areas. All channel numbers are detailed on www.ukfree.tv Type in your transmitter name to find channels.  ExpatKS, Qatar and UK I have no TV set at home.If I need to watch television at home I watch on line on the laptop. The BBC beta on line tv picture quality is excellent.  Simon Wilmshurst, Worcester The digital switchover has been very straight forward - we now have more channels than ever before - this can only be good news. Great work Digital UK - we should have done this years ago!  Iain Glover, Ponthir, Newport Anybody receiving digital TV from a repeat station will only receive a few channels. Making the TV licence yet another tax on rural Wales!  Anon, Mid Wales I moved from London to Finland in 2001. Digital broadcasts began shortly afterwards. On 30th September/1st October 2007, all the Finnish analogue transmetters were switched off in one operation, not bit by bit as in Britain. Our digibox locked onto the first channels that it found although there were other more powerful signals available. However, once I realised what was happening and manually tuned it, we got strong clear signals, despite having an aerial with half its directors missing!  Chris Sorry, I didn't get a picture at all...just kidding guys...lol...good luck...J  Joyce, Okanagan Falls, BC,Canada I bought New ariel, set top box and have had BBC digital for the past couple of weeks. The switch over has just now taken place and I NOW have nothing not a sausage for the first time since 1952 I have no TV - well thank you very much  Vincent Neale, New Tredegar South Wales UK I hope you do better in Wales than we did in the US. We lost distant stations and a couple of major local channels in the changeover to digital here in the US. Nobody seems to care because something like 85% of Americans have cable TV and so are unaffected, but there is no cable where we live. OTOH, most of the channels we still get now include extra 'sub-channels', so although we have lost ABC and CBS we now have Al Jazeera and Russia Today!  Alun Palmer, English expat in USA I live in Brighton; have all the equipment for DAB and digi TV but no reception, what's the point ? Brighton was a playhouse for George the umpteemth but it would do him no favours now ! The excellent concerts in the Dome notwithstanding. I shall go back to live music and more visits to local stuff - forget the BEEB and it's misguided (19th century) approach  John Clare, Brighton The switchover has been fine - no issues in receiving the new channels. What is frustrating is that my area does not receive as many channels as others, because the signal is being 'boosted' as opposed to having a dedicated transmitter. It doesn't bother me, really - I have Sky+ and I won't use Freeview, but the principle grates somewhat. I appreciate it's only some commercial channels we won't receive, but the fact that Freeview is 'free-er' in some places than here is annoying.  Dean Seabrook, Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, Wales Since when is Wales or England Scotland or Northern Ireland for that matter a nation? My nationality is British not English. Wales is the first digital COUNTRY in the UK, NOT the first nation. Will the BBC start being a bit more BRITISH like its title and stop fanning divisionist flames.  Rich, Gateshead, England? My experience with the switchover was easy and simple. Just press Menu, then setup, and then Auto Store. Sorted!  Josh, Aberfan, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales     "
638,"Members of the Bristol No Borders group chained themselves to a car parked across the entrance to the centre.  They said the aim was to prevent agency staff leaving in vehicles to carry out ""inhumane"" dawn raids to remove families living in the UK unlawfully.  An agency spokeswoman said officers were trained to treat families as sensitively as possible.  ""We only seek to remove families who are in the UK unlawfully when all appeal rights are exhausted and they have no further claim to remain in the UK,"" she said.  ""Throughout the removal process, we take the welfare of children extremely seriously.  ""Officers involved in family removals receive thorough training in procedures to minimise the distress caused to a removable family.  ""All officers involved are trained to treat all members of the family as sensitively as possible.""  But Jo Freeman from the No Borders group said: ""Doors are kicked in and families are snatched from their beds and taken to detention centres, where they are punished for seeking refuge in this country, and taken away from their houses, jobs, schools and communities.""  Similar dawn protests were staged in Portishead, Portsmouth, Newcastle and Glasgow just before Christmas."
639,"The cost of inquiries into Princess Diana's death is nearing £7m There is ""not a shred of evidence"" that the Duke of Edinburgh ordered Princess Diana's death or that it was organised by MI6, the inquest has heard. Coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker said jurors could find that Diana and Dodi Al Fayed died accidentally, or because of negligence. Many conspiracy theories suggested by Dodi's father Mohamed about the deaths were without foundation, he insisted. The couple died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. Speaking to the jury after six months of evidence, the coroner said many of Mohamed Al Fayed's theories about the crash were ""so demonstrably without foundation"" that even his lawyer was no longer pursuing them. He put aside theories which, he said, had been encouraged by the media for the past 10 years, as he began to go through evidence from more than 250 witnesses. Mohamed Al Fayed was in court to hear the coroner He said of Mr Al Fayed's ideas: ""They are not being pursued because there is not a shred of evidence to support them. ""Foremost among them is the proposition that Diana was assassinated by the secret intelligence service (MI6) on the orders of the Duke of Edinburgh. ""There is no evidence that the Duke of Edinburgh ordered Diana's execution, and there is no evidence that the secret intelligence service or any other Government agency organised it."" He said the lengthy and costly inquest had played a crucial role in testing those theories - but that some people would continue to believe in the murder theory no matter what the verdict was. Of the alleged murder he said: ""There are no doubt those who genuinely believe this to be the case and will continue to do so regardless of any verdict you return. ""You have heard the evidence and it is your decision that matters and not anyone else's. ""You will have been reassured to have heard that Mohamed Al Fayed told you on oath that he will accept your verdict; no doubt the other interested persons will do likewise."" He said that he and the jury - plus one Diana fan who sat through all the proceedings with the words ""Diana"" and ""Dodi"" painted on his face - were the only ones to hear every word of evidence. Lord Baker gave the jury five verdict options, and added: ""I have determined that it is not open to you to find that this was unlawful killing by the Duke of Edinburgh or anyone else in a staged accident."" The five options included unlawful killing by grossly negligent driving of the paparazzi in the following vehicles; unlawful killing through the gross negligence of the driver Henri Paul; and unlawful killing by the grossly negligent driving of both the following vehicles and Mr Paul. A verdict of accidental death could be returned if none of the previous verdicts are established. The jury was also given the option of an open verdict. Lord Baker said it was regrettable that there had been some witnesses ""who it appears have told lies in the witness box or elsewhere"", naming former butler Paul Burrell as one of those who were ""liars by their own admission"". Mr Burrell appeared at the inquest for three days in January, but in a video recording obtained by the Sun newspaper he apparently claimed he introduced ""red herrings"" during his evidence and held back facts. He then refused to re-appear at the inquest to explain discrepancies between his evidence and comments reported in the newspaper. At the time, the coroner said he could not compel him to give evidence because Mr Burrell lives outside the court's jurisdiction in the US."
640,"The Guildford Four have had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal following an extensive inquiry into the original police investigation.  As he emerged from the court, one of the four, Gerard Conlon, announced to the waiting crowds: ""I have been in prison for something I did not do. I am totally innocent.""  ""The Maguire seven are innocent. Let's hope the Birmingham six are freed,"" he added.  The investigation into the case, considered to be the biggest miscarriage of justice in Britain, was carried out by Avon and Somerset Police. They found serious flaws in the way Surrey police noted the confessions of the four.  The confession of Patrick Armstrong was central to the investigation and the inquiry concluded the notes taken were not written up immediately and officers may have colluded in the wording of the statements.  Roy Amlott QC said in court: ""New evidence of great significance has come to light after a police inquiry"".  ""It has thrown such doubt on the honesty and integrity of a number of Surrey police officers investigating this case... the Crown is now unable to say that the convictions of any of the four were safe or satisfactory,"" he added.  The Guildford Four - as they were dubbed - were jailed for life in 1975 for bombing pubs in Guildford. The attacks left five people dead and over 100 injured. Paul Hill and Patrick Armstrong were also wrongfully sentenced for a bomb attack in Woolwich that killed two people. They each served 15 years in prison. Gerard Conlon, Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson were released immediately while Paul Hill was taken to a Belfast prison. He is serving time for the murder of a British soldier, Brian Shaw, but is expected to be released soon. Three of the police officers who conducted the original interviews have now been suspended by Surrey police. Two others have already left the force. Home Secretary Douglas Hurd has ordered an immediate judicial inquiry into the case as well as an official criminal investigation into the conduct of the officers involved. ""We must all, I believe, feel anxiety, regret and deep concern at what has occurred,"" he said."
641,"Zimbabwe's key referendum on a new constitution has been ""tentatively"" set for 16 March, government minister Eric Matinenga has said.  Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said the referendum would herald a major step towards democratic reform, AFP news agency reports.  It would be followed by elections, expected to be contested by Mr Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe.  The date was announced as the election chief resigned, citing ill health.  The 88-year-old Mr Mugabe has been in power since independence in 1980.  Details of the new constitution, agreed by Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai, have not been officially released.  But it is believed that it sets a limit of two terms for future presidents.  Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai are expected to urge voters to approve the constitution, opening the way for elections to be held under the new rules.  The election would herald the end of the shaky coalition the two leaders formed after the disputed 2008 election, when Mr Tsvangirai - the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) - boycotted a run-off after claiming he had been robbed of victory during the first round.  Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party was also accused of unleashing violence against MDC supporters, an allegation it denied.  The two parties then formed a coalition government under pressure from regional leaders.  ""I can confirm 16 March is the tentative referendum date,"" said Mr Matinenga, the constitutional affairs minister, an MDC member.  ""I've indicated that maybe there's a need to rethink so that at least we have two days of voting for the referendum,"" he added, in a briefing to journalists in the capital, Harare.  Sources say the general elections are expected to be held between 15 and 30 July.  Mr Tsvangirai told AFP he would fight to ensure that ""no-one is disenfranchised by hook or by crook"" in the elections.  ""If Mugabe's position that we need a free and fair election is a ruse, then he would have cheated me,"" he is quoted as saying.  Meanwhile, election commission chief Simpson Mutambanengwe, who was expected to organise the votes this year, has resigned, said Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa of Zanu-PF.  ""The resignation is on the grounds of health,"" Zimbabwe's state-owned Herald newspaper quotes Mr Chinamasa as saying  MDC Secretary-General and Finance Minister Tendai Biti said his decision was regrettable.  ""The judge is a man of good standing,"" he said.  A replacement for Mr Mutambanengwe, a retired judge who was appointed after the disputed 2008 poll, would be chosen after discussions involving the coalition partners, Mr Chinamasa said.  Zimbabwe's crash-strapped government has also repeatedly said it does not have enough money to hold the votes.  ""We are looking for the money,"" Mr Tsvangirai told AFP."

Mr Herrmann said: ""It's obviously a huge privilege to land the job of running such a successful operation.""  He is replacing Pete Clifton, who is now the head of News Interactive.  Mr Herrmann said he would work with the rest of the editorial team ""to deliver the best of the BBC's journalism across all our platforms from web to interactive TV, keeping the focus on editorial excellence and creativity.  ""At the heart of this will be our ability to continue to make the most of our skill and experience in technical innovation to bring what we do to our audiences in new and effective ways,"" he added.

643,"People in the southern city of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo have blamed the police for the stampede that has now been confirmed as claiming the lives of 14 people during a local league derby between Mazembe and Lupopo.  The accusations come as the Football Association FECOFA and the Congolese government announced the setting up of a commission of enquiry into the disaster.  The FA's secretary-general Kabamba Kasongo told the BBC in the capital Kinshasa that the FA had suspended the Katanga provincial league, pending the outcome of the inquiry.  FECOFA has also closed the Lubumbashi Kenya Stadium for all football activities An aide to the governor of Katanga province also told the BBC that the police had panicked and fired the tear gas which led to the fatal stampede. The Congolese football tragedy comes right on the heels of a similar but much greater tragedy at the Ellis Park stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa, where 43 spectators were crushed to death in a stampede. The police fired tear gas to deter unruly fans who had invaded the pitch after Mazembe equalised to level the score at 1-1 with just ten minutes of the game remaining. It was confirmed on Tuesday that while seven people were trampled to death and asphyxiated in the ensuing crush, seven more died later on, bringing the toll to 14. All the funerals were held on Tuesday, with several government ministers attending.  One fan who was at the game and lost his father in the stampede told the BBC that the police were wholly to blame. ""The police intervened when objects started flying from the stands,"" he said. ""We were not even throwing stones at them - the Lupopo and Mazembe fans were throwing objects at each other, not at the police,"" he explained. ""They immediately started firing tear gas, and worse, they blocked the main exit. There was no means of escape and that's how the stampede started,"" he added. ""My father died there. It's the police fault. They should have never fired tear gas into the crowd,"" he lamented. Supporters of both clubs have a history of hatred and violence towards each other. Mazembe, who are the reigning Congolese champions were due to play Raja Casablanca of Morocco in Lubumbashi on the weekend of 11 May, in the second round of the African Champions League. But it appears that game could now be moved to the capital Kinshasa, depending on the preliminary findings of the commission of inquiry."
644,"A major project to widen a section of the A23 between Crawley and Brighton is to go ahead.  The scheme for a three-lane carriageway in each direction between Handcross and Warninglid in West Sussex will cost between £76m and £105m.  The Department for Transport said widening the road would improve journey time and safety.  Initial work will start in the summer with the project due for completion in early 2014.  A public inquiry was held in June 2009 amid concerns the scheme would pass through an ancient woodland.  Since then, the government has accepted the changes recommended by the planning inspector.  Transport Minister Chris Mole said he was pleased to see the scheme go through its ""final planning stages""."
645,"Part One of the Ruhnama was blasted off on a Russian Dnepr booster rocket from Kazakhstan's Baikonur launch site on Wednesday, local media said.  People are obliged to read Mr Niyazov's book, an interpretation of Turkmen history, for moral guidance.  Known as Turkmenbashi, or Turkmen father, he has ruled from Soviet times.  He has created a vast personality cult around himself, issuing decrees regulating behaviour in all walks of life.  He has been named president-for-life, his portrait hangs everywhere in Turkmenistan, and streets and towns have been named in his honour.  The container, which also included a Turkmen flag and presidential standard, was launched as part of a mission to place two Japanese research satellites in orbit.  ""The book that conquered the hearts of millions on Earth is now conquering space,"" said an article in the official Neitralny Turkmenistan newspaper.  The container is being described as an ""artificial satellite"". Turkmen TV said it was expected to orbit the Earth for the next 150 years.  The Ruhnama, or Book of the Soul, whose first part was published in September 2001, is studied daily in Turkmen schools and adults are obliged to read it every Saturday.  Its second part was published three years later.  The launch was reported days after Mr Niyazov signed a decree banning the playing of recorded music at public events, weddings and on TV.  He said there was a need to protect Turkmen culture from ""negative influences""."
646,"The Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal party (TMVP), set up by renegade Tiger leader Col Karuna, won every local council in and around Batticaloa city.  Human rights groups have accused the TMVP of waging a campaign of violence ahead of the voting.  The TMVP helped government forces drive the rebels out of the region last year.  Sri Lanka's government says it now wants to hold wider provincial elections and introduce limited devolution to address Tamil demands.  The TMVP won more than 70% of the vote in a peaceful poll on Monday.  Its founder, Col Karuna, was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment by a UK court in January, on charges of identity fraud.  Correspondents say that nominally he still leads the party, although it is reported to be divided as to whether he should remain in place.  In the elections in Batticaloa town, the TMVP ran under the banner of the island's ruling alliance.  The group broke away from the rebels in 2004, before turning on their former comrades to help government forces drive them from the east.  The TMVP president, who goes by the nom de guerre of Pillaiyan, told reporters that his group still has guns for security.  He also admitted that there were 30-40 former Tamil Tiger child soldiers still in his ranks. He said that livelihoods had to be found for them before they could leave his group.  Human rights groups and opposition politicians say that a climate of violence and chaos has tainted the election.  Much of the violence has been blamed on the TMVP, who have been accused of demanding protection money from businessmen and routinely killing people.  Rasiah Thurairatnam, who ran as an independent candidate in Batticaloa, told the AFP news agency that people ""voted out of fear"" for the TMVP.  He alleged serious irregularities by Col Karuna's supporters at many polling stations.  ""This is a victory for violence, and it will elicit serious repercussions from the people,"" he said. ""I see this as a license for extortion and child abduction.""  The island's main opposition party boycotted the elections in protest over what it said was the atmosphere of intimidation surrounding the vote.  In January the government pulled out of a formal commitment to a 2002 ceasefire with the Tamil Tigers, arguing the rebels had used it to re-group and re-arm.  Since then, fighting has intensified on the frontlines that surround Tiger-held territory in the north."
647,"Passengers travelling through London Paddington are facing continued disruption after a train derailment.  Network Rail said the empty train had passed a red signal outside the station, activating an automatic derailment on Thursday. Overhead power lines also came down.  Operator GWR expects to run only half its normal service on Friday morning.  Network Rail said a limited service would run to and from London Paddington until the end of Friday.  More on this story and other news from London  No Heathrow Connect service will run, but the Heathrow Express service will run every 30 minutes and Heathrow Connect tickets will be accepted.  A Great Western Railway (GWR) spokesman apologised for the disruption and said: ""At the moment, we expect to be able to run around half our normal service in to and out of Paddington on Friday morning.  ""We hope this will improve as further progress is made and we would ask customers to check before travelling.  ""Passengers should expect GWR and alternative trains to be much busier than usual, particularly with additional people travelling to Ascot.""  GWR said there was a reduced train service between Paddington and Reading.  It said the train had derailed in a siding, resulting in damage to infrastructure.  No passengers were on board when the train derailed and there were no injuries.  A Network Rail spokesman said: ""Our engineers are working around-the-clock to repair significant damage caused by this incident.  ""We are working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and to minimise the inconvenience for passengers.""  London Fire Brigade said it had been called to the station at 18:22 BST.  A statement said: ""There was one person on board at the time of the incident who left the train before the brigade arrived.  ""When crews arrived, they checked there was nobody trapped or left on board and once certain the scene was safe handed the incident back over to Network Rail.""

648,"Newly released cabinet papers from 1984 reveal mineworkers' union leader Arthur Scargill may have been right to claim there was a ""secret hit-list"" of more than 70 pits marked for closure.  The government and National Coal Board said at the time they wanted to close 20. But the documents reveal a plan to shut 75 mines over three years.  The miners' strike began in March 1984 and did not end until the next year.  Other papers from 1984 reveal warnings of violence outside the Libyan embassy, in which WPC Yvonne Fletcher was killed.  One of the warnings was passed on by the British ambassador in Tripoli, Oliver Miles, who was sceptical about what he was told by Libyan government officials.  And the previously confidential files released on Friday by the National Archives also show the effect of the Brighton bomb on Mrs Thatcher's thinking about Ireland.  The year-long miners' strike, which started in March 1984, was characterised by often violent confrontations between police and massed picketing miners.  But one of the documents in the archives suggests that there was an agreement in government to shut 75 pits over three years, and cut 64,000 jobs - but that no list of which should be closed should be issued.  Nick Jones, who covered the strike for BBC radio as its industrial correspondent and later wrote a book about the dispute, said a document in the files dating from September 1983 was of particular significance.  The document, marked ""Not to be photocopied or circulated outside the private office"", records a meeting attended by just seven people, including the prime minister, chancellor, energy secretary and employment secretary, at No 10.  The meeting was told the National Coal Board's pit closure programme had ""gone better this year than planned: there had been one pit closed every three weeks"" and the workforce had shrunk by 10%.  The new chairman of the board, Ian MacGregor, now meant to go further.  ""Mr MacGregor had it in mind over the three years 1983-85 that a further 75 pits would be closed... There should be no closure list, but a pit-by-pit procedure.  ""The manpower at the end of that time in the industry would be down to 138,000 from its current level of 202,000.""  As a result, two-thirds of Welsh miners would become redundant, a third of those in Scotland, almost half of those in north east England, half in South Yorkshire and almost half in the South Midlands. The entire Kent coalfield would close.  The final paragraph of the document read: ""It was agreed that no record of this meeting should be circulated.""  A week later another document written by a senior civil servant suggested the same small group should meet regularly in future, but that there should be ""nothing in writing which clarifies the understandings about strategy which exist between Mr MacGregor and the secretary of state for energy"".  ""If this document had ever emerged during the strike it would have been devastating for the credibility of Margaret Thatcher"" because Mrs Thatcher and Mr MacGregor always maintained there were plans for the closure of only 20 pits, said Mr Jones.  ""It raises in my mind the question of whether there was a cover-up of these figures, and whether when we look back at what actually happened Arthur Scargill was right when he claimed that Ian MacGregor wanted to butcher the industry all along.""  But it is a version of events that is pooh-poohed by Lord Armstrong, who as Sir Robert Armstrong was Mrs Thatcher's cabinet secretary at the time.  The National Coal Board was closing something like 20 pits a year anyway, he said - 75 over three years was not such a big increase. The real issue was Mr Scargill's ""impossible demand"" for a guarantee that uneconomic pits would not be closed.  So why the secrecy? ""I think when you're in a negotiation of this kind you want to show as little of your hand as you can to those who are negotiating, particularly if the purposes of those people are, as they were in this case, malign,"" he told the BBC.  The papers reveal that in July 1984 - when the dock workers also went out on strike - the government briefly wobbled and considered calling a state of emergency and getting troops to move coal.  But it decided the risk of alienating crucial power station workers was too great. ""The use of service drivers... would sharply increase the emotional temperature,"" ministers were warned.  In November of that year, two Home Office civil servants reviewed police tactics during the strike and found them sometimes wanting.  Alison Smith and her colleague Robert Hazell visited two police forces in the thick of the dispute - West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire.  They concluded that one of the most controversial tactics used by the police, stopping coach-loads of striking miners on their way to mass pickets and turning them back, may have been counter-productive.  ""Turning them back may merely send them to other destinations to demonstrate, rather than deterring them from attending a picket line at all,"" they wrote.  And once they had been diverted the police might have no information on where they were.  Both police forces made use of outside manpower in the shape of ""police support units"", or PSUs, from other forces.  The civil servants found the most sought-after PSUs came from non-metropolitan police forces in the south of England - Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Avon and Somerset and West Mercia. But those from London could be a problem.  ""Metropolitan PSUs were valued in violent confrontations but at other times... their attitudes were thought to be harder for local people to identify with and so perhaps more likely to lead to an increase in tension.  ""The casual approach of the metropolitan PSUs had been a surprise to those forces which had not the same experience of public order problems being treated as everyday occurrences.""  The files also contain details of three warnings received by the Foreign Office of possible violence at the demonstration outside the Libyan embassy - known as the Libyan people's bureau - on the morning of 17 April 1984.  On that morning WPC Fletcher died and 11 people were injured when a machine-gun was fired into a crowd of anti-Gaddafi demonstrators from the windows of the bureau in St James's Square in central London.  The first warning came from a pair of Libyan diplomats who rang the Foreign Office and then went there in person just after midnight, and again on the morning of the shooting.  A telegram later that day to Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, who was in Beijing, described the shooting as ""a very ugly incident"" and said the diplomats' request had been passed on to the Home Office and the police during the night, ""drawing attention to the fact that the Libyans were capable of carrying out their threats"".  The telegram said Special Branch decided nonetheless to allow the demonstration to go ahead. ""A substantial police presence was arranged and barriers were installed to control the crowd,"" it said.  A second warning came when Mr Miles was summoned to a meeting at the Libyan foreign ministry, again after midnight.  In a telegram to London sent early the next day he reported what a Libyan official had said: ""The Libyan government would not be responsible for the consequences if the demonstration took place and they might include violence.""  He replied that threats of violence did not impress the British government.  His telegram went on: ""I was shown out by the UK desk officer who seemed as little impressed by this performance as I was. I made a bet with him that no such demonstration will take place. Grateful to know the outcome.""  Mr Miles has long since retired but denied he had not taken the warning seriously. ""I did take it seriously, which was why I passed it on to the Foreign Office,"" he said. ""But I didn't believe it, no.""  Sir Geoffrey later told the Commons: ""The House should know that such night-time summonses were by no means unusual in Tripoli.""  The third warning came from GCHQ, which intercepted a message from Tripoli instructing those in the Bureau to open fire - but the intercepts only arrived three hours after WPC Fletcher was shot.  The following day Mrs Thatcher, who was on an official visit to Lisbon, accepted that the policewoman's murderer would have to go free in order to protect British diplomats and citizens in Libya, even if the public were outraged.  The Libyans enjoyed diplomatic immunity and the police could not arrest them or enter their bureau. A police request to search the bureau would, she was told, ""set a very dangerous precedent"" and would invite retaliation in Tripoli.  There is a note of a phone conversation between Mrs Thatcher and home secretary Leon Brittan in London.  ""The home secretary asked whether repatriating the Libyan staff, including the perpetrator of the murder, could be defended.  ""The prime minister thought it could, provided British staff were successfully repatriated too.""  In a later discussion, the pair also agreed that Britain would have to turn a blind eye if the Libyans used diplomatic bags to smuggle weapons out of the bureau.  In the event, while police in London besieged the Libyan people's bureau for a total of 11 days, the British embassy in Tripoli was also surrounded. Mr Miles cabled on 17 April: ""My staff and I are being prevented from leaving the embassy by a group of revolutionaries who are issuing orders to the police.""  And on 24 April the ambassador reported that the Libyans were threatening (""via Willey of the BBC"") to enter and burn his embassy if police in London entered the Libyan bureau.  There were several days of tense negotiations before women and children from the embassy were allowed to leave Libya. The rest of the diplomats followed as Britain and Libya broke off diplomatic relations (they were not restored until 1999).  Meanwhile, the Libyans in London finally left their bureau on 27 April and were taken to the Civil Service College at Sunningdale to be questioned by police before being put on a plane at Heathrow.  Parliament was later told that police had narrowed down the identity of the murderer to one of two people, but that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.  A list in the files of the 30 people taken from the bureau included one man named as the shooter in 2011 by a Canadian prosecutor working on behalf of Scotland Yard.  The newly-released files also show the effect of the Brighton bomb of 12 October 1984 - which targeted the Conservative conference hotel in the town, killing five and injuring many others - on Mrs Thatcher's thinking about Ireland.  She had been due to meet Irish leader Garret FitzGerald at a summit a month after her party conference to discuss an Anglo-Irish agreement (eventually signed in November 1985, and seen as the first step in the process that led to the Good Friday agreement of 1998).  Secret talks had been going on for many months between Sir Robert Armstrong and his opposite number in Dublin, Dermot Nally, aimed at forging an agreement.  But on a background briefing for the summit the prime minister wrote: ""The events of Thursday night at Brighton mean that we must go very slow on these talks if not stop them. It would look as if we were bombed into making concessions to the Republic.""  In the event a meeting on 31 October decided to continue the Armstrong/Nally talks.  Foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey told his colleagues: ""There was no question of the government being bombed into concessions. But nor should they be bombed out of a search for a settlement.""  She rejected an early draft of a communique to be issued after the summit, writing at the top of the document: ""I could not possibly agree to this. It would strike fear into the unionists.""  Beside the proposed form of words - ""There can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of its people"" - she wrote ""Not strong enough"" and offered an alternative: ""The province is part of the UK and will remain so unless the majority etc.""  At the summit itself, in a private meeting with no civil servants present, the two leaders shared their fears that if the peace process did not move forward the moderate nationalist SDLP would lose ground to Sinn Fein. Mr FitzGerald said that might lead to civil war.  Mrs Thatcher told him the IRA had a Marxist and an international terrorist dimension to it.  ""She was beginning to understand what the United States felt about Nicaragua,"" she added.  After the summit she caused a diplomatic incident when she robustly rejected at a press conference three possible models for the future of Northern Ireland - unification with the Republic, confederation or joint British-Irish rule.  This caused a furore in Ireland, and Mr FitzGerald privately called her remarks ""gratuitously offensive"".  His words were leaked - one consequence was that Mrs Thatcher decided not to send him a personal letter thanking him for coming to the summit.  ""Neither of us, I think, underestimates the difficulties; but our talks at Chequers have helped to clarify the problems and the good-will between us is a solid foundation on which to build,"" she wrote.  The letter was signed: ""Every good wish, yours ever, Margaret.""  At the top of the letter one of her senior advisers, Charles Powell, wrote: ""The prime minister subsequently decided not to send this letter. Please retain on file.""  Update 13 February 2014: Chris Collins of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation has written to me complaining that the target of more than 70 pit closures only ever represented the ""preliminary conclusions"" of the Coal Board chairman Ian MacGregor, and - on the evidence of the documents quoted - was never adopted as government policy.  He and I agree that in September 1983 ministers were told at a meeting about MacGregor's plan to close 64 pits, rising to 75 over three years. I argue this plan was ""secret"", as evidenced by the decision not to circulate a written record of the meeting and by a note of 21 September from Mrs Thatcher's private secretary which says there is to be nothing in writing clarifying the understandings between MacGregor and ministers.  But what happened after that? At a meeting on 19 January 1984 ministers explicitly adopted a plan to cut jobs by 45,000 over two years (and thus close 45 pits). Nothing was said about any further closures. ""Summing up,"" we are told, ""the Prime Minister said that the objective of a more accelerated run-down of coal capacity was accepted."" Nick Jones argues this implies support for the longer-term objective of achieving NCB break-even by 1988, which MacGregor believed meant closing up to 75 pits.  There is in the documents no explicit statement adopting the 75 pit target as government policy (though given the sensitivity about putting anything in writing you would not expect one). Equally, there is no explicit statement disavowing the target."
649,"Spanish King Felipe VI's sister Princess Cristina could face trial after a Spanish court upheld tax fraud charges against her.  However, the high court in Palma de Mallorca dropped money-laundering charges.  The charges relate to business dealings by her husband, Inaki Urdangarin.  Many Spaniards have recently lost confidence in the monarchy following a series of scandals, including Princess Cristina's case.  Judges have been investigating allegations that the princess's husband embezzled millions in public funds with a former business partner and that the princess had knowingly benefited from the dealings.  Her lawyers have said they are completely convinced of her innocence.  Her husband, Mr Urdangarin, stands accused with 15 others of embezzling 5.6m euros (£4.6m; $7.5m) of public money from the Noos Institute - a charitable sports foundation that used to be presided over by Mr Urdangarin.  Between 2004 and 2006, the institute organised a series of sporting events for the regional governments of the Balearic Islands and Valencia.  The central allegation is that Mr Urdangarin, along with business partner Diego Torres, hugely overcharged the two regional governments.  Princess Cristina sat on the board of Noos when her husband was its president.  The money from the Noos Institute was allegedly transferred into several companies and offshore accounts, including Aizoon SL, a company that Princess Cristina owned with her husband.  Questioned in court in February, Cristina said she had trusted her husband and had no knowledge of his business affairs.  Spanish media report that the trial is likely to take place in 2016.  ""We are going to continue with the defence because we believe that there are not sufficient grounds to bring any kind of accusation,"" Princess Cristina's lawyer, Miquel Roca, told reporters after Friday's ruling.  The judge, Jose Castro, said that the princess should go on trial for using public money for ""personal spending"".  The fraud case has been one of a series of scandals that has weakened the popularity of the Spanish monarchy and prompted the abdication of King Juan Carlos in June. He was succeeded by his son, Felipe VI.  The investigation into alleged fraud has been a huge embarrassment for the Spanish royal family."
650,"Belle de Jour's story has been blog, book, and TV drama    The unmasking of Belle de Jour makes us think of a litany of brilliant courtesans, writes Clive James in his weekly column. For several years, the true identity of Belle de Jour, author of a blog called Diary of a London Call Girl, had been a mystery. Journalists, always excited by mysteries, strove to find out who she really was. Was she really a woman at all? Experienced male journalists who could do sentences with three clauses in them speculated that she might be a male journalist because of her unusual literary skills. When Belle de Jour's daintily scurrilous blog was collected into a hit book, several critics noted that she had a command of language comparable to that of Martin Amis. Perhaps Belle de Jour was really Salman Rushdie. Surely no mere female could concoct a diary so exactly fulfilling male fantasies. When the book was turned into a television series, Billie Piper was up there on screen like Catherine Deneuve in the art-house movie from which our blogger, knowledgeable about art-house movies, had lifted her, or his, name. The Catherine Deneuve movie was the story of a refined woman answering her imaginative needs by spending her afternoons in a bordello, taking on all comers, but never chipping her nail polish. In the blog of our latter-day Belle de Jour, that was the soignee image that the author strove to project. In the TV series, as Billie Piper delicately primped, it looked very like a male's imaginative needs being fulfilled. But finally, last weekend, Belle de Jour stood revealed as a female after all. A Point of View is on Fridays on Radio 4 at 2050 GMT Or listen to it here later And what a female. The voice behind the most celebrated of all soft porn blogs turned out to belong to a woman of outstanding beauty and brilliance called Dr Brooke Magnanti, student of informatics, epidemiology and forensic science. She must also have been a student of military strategy. When it became clear to her that one of the tabloid newspapers was about to blow her secret, she reacted like Rommel. Attacking out of defence, she stepped in ahead of time and spilled all to one of the weekend broadsheets, thus positioning herself invulnerably upmarket, where she will undoubtedly stay, the glossiest British-based femme fatale since Lady Bienvenida Buck, and much less likely to be forgotten. Judging from her qualifications, Dr Magnanti's sudden appearance at the top of the media heap was only fitting. She would have been wasted down there in the land of tabloid fantasy, where the mind is not regarded as an erogenous zone to be expanded, though every other erogenous zone is expanded to the limit. Dr Magnanti is a different kind of sex goddess altogether, with the emphasis on the goddess. She is the thinking man's dream girl, and as such she is a nightmare for all those who occupy themselves with the condition of what we now know as the sex worker. Common sense tells us that sex work ranges from outright slavery at the bottom end, where kidnapped foreign girls are kept drugged by ruthless pimps, to a delusional miasma at the top end, where supposedly high-toned escorts delude themselves that they are doing the using instead of being used. Above all this, Dr Magnanti floats like a lily on a bog, but she makes a good show of having turned the work into an art form, first with a book deal, then with a TV series, now with an all-media fame that is already looking highly exploitable. Just think of the merchandising possibilities. Belle de Jour informatic foam bath crystals. Belle de Jour forensic science foot massage cream. The only question is whether all those other females with doctorates in informatics are going to feel inadequate if they have never been courtesans. Not for the first time in history, a courtesan has made honest women look a bit pedestrian. Courtesans could be richly rewarded by their lovers Proving that sex work, even at its most elevated, has the same relation to work as bad breath has to breath, our Belle de Jour is in a modern tradition of the higher hooking that reached its first peak in 19th Century Paris, where fashionable society was briefly dazzled by the short career of Marie Duplessis, who presaged Dr Magnanti in every aspect except the blog. The blog, and an early death. Marie Duplessis, born merely Rose Plessis, lived only 23 years, but in that brief span she emerged out of nowhere to become one of the most socially accomplished women of her day. She enslaved men, and they gave her things in return for her favours. When she transferred her favours to other men, the original men still gave her things. One of the men was the writer Alexander Dumas the younger, who was her lover for a year. When she transferred her affections upwards beyond mere writers, he took no revenge but wrote the book that made her immortal, The Lady of the Camellias. Eventually Verdi tuned the book into one of his greatest operas, Traviata, and Garbo starred in Camille, the most beautiful of her movies after Ninotchka. The richness of Marie Duplessis's life after death should not distract, however, from the richness of her life while she lived. She reached a high state of mental cultivation and could converse delightfully on many subjects, although it is not certain whether informatics was among them. She loved music and musicians loved her. One was Liszt, who wanted to move in with her. The brilliance of her mind, along with her startling sexual attraction, made her salons the focus for all the fashionable men of her time. These eventually included the nobility, and when she succumbed to tuberculosis the French count she had married was in attendance, while, even more remarkably, the Swedish count that she hadn't married was there too. She died broke but hundreds of men came to her funeral. She was a poetic young lady and they were all proud that she had spent their money, but there can be no romantic view of how she had earned it. The myth of the happy hooker dies hard, mainly because it isn't always a myth. Another 19th Century courtesan, Lola Montez, slept her way so close to the very top that Ludwig I of Bavaria was shaken on his throne. Liszt was on her list, too. She had a ball from start to finish. It isn't easy to think of a woman like that slogging away at an honest job. But that's where the catch comes in - just at that point where men get sentimental on a woman's behalf. When Dr Magnanti tells us that she could never have financed her degree course unless she had yielded to the hard fact that what she would have earned from a boring week behind the cake stall was comfortably exceeded by what she could earn in half an hour on her back, she isn't saying that she found a better kind of work. She's saying that she found something better than work. And it might even feel like that, but it still leaves the idea of work sounding like something that only stupid people believe in. As long as men are romantic, there will be women realistic enough to cash in. Or anyway they fancy themselves as realists, although I notice that most of them, however they proclaim the legitimacy of their trade, get out early if they can. But let's forget about the women's realism for the moment, and concentrate on the men's romanticism, which is the surely the nub of the matter. My own guess is that Belle will marry a future crowned head of Europe, but if she settles for mere show business she will probably be the first person to win Celebrity Come Dancing and The X Factor in the same year    Far from looking for a relationship uncomplicated by feeling, a romantic man, when he tries to solve his problems with his wallet, is looking for a feeling uncomplicated by a relationship. As far as I know I've never met a sex worker, but to the extent that I can intuit what goes on, she offers the illusion of a contact that consists of nothing but emotion. It can't be had in real life, so men pay up to enter the dream world where they can find it. After Dr Magnanti got in early and gave her story to the broadsheet, the tabloid that had tracked her down was left stuck with the revelations of some of her acquaintances. My favourite among these - you understand I read this only for purposes of research - was an ex-boyfriend who still pines for the lyricism of what they had together. Apparently they plighted their troth with two rings, buried the rings in the beach, walked along the beach hand in hand, leaned back against haystacks and gazed up at the stars. He is still convinced that her love for him was true. And so it might have been, but it was also perfectly suited to his dreams. With Dr Magnanti we are dealing with a master, or let it be a mistress, of public relations. One of her female acquaintances fears for Dr Magnanti's future. ""I wonder, though,"" says the female acquaintance, ""if she is ready for the inevitable media blitz."" I would be surprised if she is not ready for it like Robbie Williams. She has been getting ready for it all her life. My own guess is that she will marry a future crowned head of Europe, but if she settles for mere showbusiness she will probably be the first person to win Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor in the same year. There can be no doubt that she dances like Ginger Rogers and sings like Anna Netrebko. There is nothing this woman can't do, and you can tell by the history of her blogging. She has been blogging since blogging was invented. Fresh out of school, she blogged about restaurants. After that, by a sequence of events that will no doubt be explained to us in due course, she blogged about autopsies. She wrote short stories for her blog. She was Ernest Hemingway. She knows everything. She even knows what informatics is. I looked it up, and basically it means information theory. Someone interested in that was never going to keep a secret. She was only ever going to decide when she would sell it. Here is a selection of your comments. Sex work is work. It's not better than work. It is work. Just as journalism is still work even if it's travelling around the world writing about the quality of the champagne you had in Monte Carlo rather than dredging through Lily Allen's bins looking for something salacious to titillate your tabloid editors, so sex workers are workers whether they're hooking on the streets or dining at Michelin-starred restaurants with foreign dignitaries.  McDuff, Manchester Women working (that's working) in the sex industry are employed in the most dangerous occupation in the UK. They are more likely be killed or injured in the course of their work (it's more dangerous than fire-fighting) or die from work-related disease. If economic power wasn't still gripped in the clammy hands of men, women would no more sell their bodies than other exploited groups would sell their organs to rich donors. But you know that already, don't you? So what's it all about?  Usquebaugh, Oxford, UK The article says: ""Far from looking for a relationship uncomplicated by feeling, a romantic man, when he tries to solve his problems with his wallet, is looking for a feeling uncomplicated by a relationship."" It is poetic license to describe any man willing to look for a feeling he can solve with his wallet as ""romantic"". Romance is the last thing on his mind, even if self-delusion has turned the feeling he has into a romantic notion. Equally, I think it is true of many women that they are capable of having sex, without the motivation being one of romance, as Belle du Jour has proved. This whole field is one strewn with mines many of which are left-over from our Victorian forefathers. Belle du Jour has proven that an intelligent person, can eschew the social norms and look out for number one in the way she chooses.   Geoff Davis, East Dulwich, London So much for the government's stated objective to make Britain a world leader in academic scientific endeavour, when graduate students have to finance their research degrees through prostitution.  T J Sackville-West, London I am not sure what Clive James means when he says, ""Proving that sex work, even at its most elevated, has the same relation to work as bad breath has to breath, our Belle de Jour is in a modern tradition of the higher hooking...."". From what she herself has done and said, and what Clive James himself says, Dr Brooke Magnanti has proved the complete opposite - that her sex work has the same relation to work as breath freshener has to breath.  Bon Nuit, Derby, UK I am a PhD student and although my parents financially support me, my lifestyle in London requires further funding. Did I become a hooker? No, I got a lecturing job, a tutoring job and private tutoring work and I retained my self-respect and professional credibility. This fallacy of stripping/lapdancing/prostituting being OK if it is funding a post-graduate education is misguided, there are other options - well-paid, easily available, options. There are many ways to support yourself through post-graduate education and one of the most lucrative ways is teaching at a university, such work is offered to any PhD student on a plate. Fine, if you choose prostitution as work, maybe it will mean fewer sex-traffic victims being forced into prostitution and that's good, but don't try and use financing post-graduate education as a reason to be a hooker, in academia there are many other options for earning money.  Julia, London, UK Maybe there are some prostitutes who enjoy their work, but it must be a tiny minority. It's well-known that a high proportion of women in the sex industry are forced into it, some violently, some by getting them hooked on heroin and controlling the supply. Prostitutes are at much higher than average risk of being beaten, raped and murdered, or of committing suicide. Belle de Jour will no doubt be welcomed by the porn industry who would love people to think that hookers are having a good time... unfortunately this is rarely true.  Tom Foxe, Norwich, UK I'm sorry - where is the actual argument that sex work isn't work? I slave 60-hour weeks for £20K a year so that my company director can swan into the office a few times a month, swear at me and head off on another foreign holiday. I could be making more by pandering to his and other men's fantasies a few evenings a week. You really think Belle has been used more than I'm currently being? Sex work is not a job like any other, but it is a job. Why on earth does it have to be romantic? I don't think common sense has told you anything whatsoever, to be quite frank. Whenever we sell a service for money, we are both user and used - no matter what the service is.  Sarah Nice job if one can restrict their clients to those they would be willing to have sex with for free. If not, many of us women would rather clean toilets for 40 hours + a week.   Cathleen, Seattle Courtesans have wielded tremendous influence and power throughout history, either as villains or as heroines. The geishas of Japan and dancing nautch girls of Lucknow have been immortalised in eastern culture. The sex worker comes from various strata of society, from the lowest ""caged and bonded prostitutes"" to the consorts of the rich and powerful. Remember the Profumo Scandal or the Umrao Jaan?  Rudolph A Furtado, Mumbai ""Lola Montez"" was actually the Irish-born Eliza Gilbert and was schooled in Sunderland. Rather less glamorous than she portrayed herself.  Peter, Notts ""There is nothing this woman can't do."" Well, she clearly can't find a decent job and get a degree like many of us before her. It sounds like those of us who work in regular jobs are mugs, and those (sorry, just women - I notice that Mr James failed to mention male prostitutes) who sell themselves are geniuses. What a strange way to look at the world.  Bella de nuit, Birmingham     "
651,"Dr Jennie Blackwell rounded on Ms Hewitt during a question and answer session at the British Medical Association conference in Manchester.  She said her hospital A&E department had been turned into a ""war zone"" as patients were sped through.  Ms Hewitt said targets had helped drive improvements in the health service.  Dr Blackwell, a member of the BMA's junior doctors committee, said that in the medical assessment unit (MAU) where she had worked, patients were being moved from A&E before they were ready in order to meet the target.  She said patients could end up waiting up to 10 hours, including the A&E wait, before being channelled to the right part of the hospital.  She said at times the ward, which does not have a waiting time target, was packed with trolleys and patients.  And Dr Blackwell, who would not reveal which hospital she worked at, added: ""We have patients strewn all over the unit, sitting in non medical areas with serious medical conditions.  ""It is frankly dangerous. We dread going to work, especially in the winter.  ""Please, please, please reduce this target, it is awful for patients and awful for us.""  Ms Hewitt, the first health secretary to address the BMA's annual conference, said she was willing to discuss the issue, but maintained targets had their place.  ""Although they are crude, they are helping to achieve the much needed improvement in the service.""  Dr Jonathan Fielden, deputy chairman of the BMA's consultants committee, said this problem had been raised by other doctors across the UK but he did not believe it was common.  ""It is a particular issue where NHS trusts focus on a target rather than the whole process of care for a patient,"" he said."

653,"The Kinks had hits with Waterloo Sunset and Lola The Kinks singer Ray Davies has said the band are ""three quarters of the way there"" for a possible reunion. ""The stumbling block is my brother because he was seriously ill recently and whether he feels ready to do it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row. The Kinks, one of the most popular rock bands of the 1960s, scored UK number one hits with You Really Got Me, Tired of Waiting and Sunny Afternoon. The band went through a number of line-up changes over the years, and Ray and Dave had a volatile relationship. The Kinks last performed together in 1996. ""There is a desire to do it, but the thing that would make me decide yes or no would be whether or not we could do new songs, even if it's four or five,"" Davies said. ""But I couldn't do it just for nostalgic reasons."" ""My pitch to the other guys in the band - because I'm really for it - was what would we have written if we hadn't have had our first hit, You Really Got Me?"" he said. ""What if we put ourselves in that situation, what would have happened? So I think new work is important for artists as they mature and get older. ""The amazing thing is that The Kinks are the only band, of that period, where the only original members are still alive,"" he added. Davies was speaking ahead of the opening of his new London musical Come Dancing, which he also stars in.

The loss was just the fifth this season for Williams stopping her just short of becoming the first woman to win $4m in a single season.  Williams, the Wimbledon, French and US Open champion, stepped onto the Staples Centre court prepared for a tough evening from Clijsters, a player who had given her problems this season.  But the Belgian began the match on an ominous note, double-faulting her opening serve on the way to being broken.  Like all her other matches, Williams, who was playing in her first event in five weeks, had difficulty finding her range committing an astounding 34 unforced errors in the opening set.  Clijsters, however, also struggled early on, both players holding serve just once in the first seven games.  The first set appeared headed for a tie-break when Williams serving at 5-6, went ahead 40-0.  But Clijsters would not wilt, breaking the American to take the first set.  Clijsters would also have the only break of the second set, surging ahead 4-2 then holding serve to collect the winner's purse of $765,000."
655,"No expense will have been spared preparing Australia's and England's cricketers for the first Ashes Test on Wednesday - from training and physiotherapy, to a good dinner and a luxurious bed. It was very different for the first Australian team to visit the UK.  As Michael Clarke and his Australian side finalise their preparations for the Ashes, Cricket Australia will leave no stone unturned in its quest to regain the urn.  The Australian side arrived in the UK some seven weeks before the start of the first Test at Trent Bridge. Throughout its stay, the squad will adhere to a finely tuned schedule ensuring players start each match at the peak of fitness - and recover quickly afterwards.  But for the first Australian side to tour the UK, conditions were markedly different.  In 1868, English ex-pat and former first class cricketer Charles Lawrence brought a team of 13 Victoria-based Aboriginal players to the UK, intent on capitalising on public curiosity regarding ""exotic races"" following the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859.  The tour faced strong opposition from the Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines in Victoria, which feared that the Aboriginal players would struggle to survive the dismal English weather - it turned out to be a good summer, though the tour continued until October.  Concern had been heightened by the deaths of four players during and immediately after an abortive Sydney tour the previous year, at least two of them from pneumonia. Lawrence was therefore forced to smuggle the players from Victoria into Sydney, where they boarded a wool-carrying clipper bound for the UK on 8 February 1868.  Despite this, former Australian test cricketer Ashley Mallett, author of a book about the tour, Lords' Dreaming, doesn't believe the players were coerced.  ""The players would have been happy for all the attention. In Australia at that time, Aboriginal people were treated very badly. Racism was rife,"" he says.  The team eventually arrived at Gravesend on 13 May, after more than three months at sea - the outward journey alone took longer than the entire 2013 Ashes tour.  After a demonstration of their skills at Town Malling, the following day the Sporting Life wrote that they ""gave great satisfaction to a critical coterie of spectators"".  ""They are the first Australian natives who have visited this country on such a novel expedition, but it must not be inferred they that they are savages,"" the report continued.  The first match featuring an Australian team in the UK began on 25 May 1868, against a Surrey side at the Oval. A crowd of 7,000 turned up for the first day's play.  The Aboriginal side lost - as they did their first five matches of the tour - but several players impressed observers with the standard of their play. Johnny Mullagh was an all-rounder of genuine talent, while Johnny Cuzens was a fearsome fast bowler.  Squad members of lesser cricketing aptitude were given the opportunity to shine in other ways. Most matches featured two days of cricket followed by a third day of ""sports"". This involved a mixture of the bizarre - running the 100 yards backwards and a contest involving picking up stones placed a yard apart - and more traditional Aboriginal events such as boomerang throwing.  Dick-a-Dick (the players were known by sobriquets as the public found their real names too difficult to pronounce), for example, had little in the way of cricket ability, yet became an undoubted star of the tour because of his skill at ""dodging"". Spectators threw cricket balls from 10 paces, which Dick-a-Dick ""dodged"" using a parrying shield and leangle (an Aboriginal war club). He was hit just once on the entire tour.  One frightening stunt involved a group of players throwing spears at their team-mates - when they had finished, the men were encircled by a ring of spears, the sharp points buried in the ground.  The tour faced resistance from the more conservative members of the British cricketing fraternity, however. Lawrence was desperate for the side to play a match at Lord's, knowing acceptance by the MCC would lead to a rush of lucrative offers from other clubs.  The Minutes of the MCC from 1868 show the Committee was dead against the idea of ""tribal demonstrations"" following any potential match, stating that ""the exhibition was not one suited for Lord's ground"".  The match was eventually agreed to and played on 11-12 June, against a side featuring an Earl and a Viscount. The Aboriginal side lost narrowly, but impressed with both their play and their dignified conduct. Despite the MCC's misgivings, an afternoon of ""sports"" took place when the second day's cricket finished early.  There followed a heated debate within the MCC Committee, though the Treasurer concluded by noting that ""the performance seemed to give general satisfaction and the public would have been much disappointed if the sports had not taken place"".  As Lawrence predicted, the success of the Lord's match led to further offers, but little consideration was given to the risk of exhausting the players. Matches were arranged in quick succession at opposite ends of the country, leading to a lot of travelling. The team was on the field for 99 out of a possible 126 days.  The tour was struck by one serious tragedy. King Cole, arguably the side's most proficient fielder, had been taken ill with a chest complaint after the Lord's match. His condition quickly worsened, and he died on 24 June 1868 - apparently of tuberculosis and pneumonia.  According to Aboriginal belief, it is a terrible thing to die away from home, and Mallett suspects that Lawrence may not have told the side of King Cole's death for some time.  ""In the Aboriginal culture, friends and relatives of a deceased person can sometimes mourn in 'sorry' mode for days, often weeks, and such a time span would have brought the tour to an abrupt halt,"" he explains.  Two other members of the team, Jim Crow and Sundown, suffered bitterly after King Cole's death, and returned to Sydney in September, a month before the tour ended.  In total the side won a creditable 14 matches, losing the same number and drawing on 19 occasions.  The tour was a financial success, officially netting a total profit of £2,176, but there is no evidence, Mallett says, that any Aboriginal player received payment.  Any possibility of subsequent tours ended with the implementation of the 1869 Aboriginal Protection Act, which gave the Victoria Aboriginal Protection Board the power to separate Aboriginal children from their families so that they could be ""educated"" within a European system. The new law meant overseas travel was now out of the question.  It was not until 1988 that the next Aboriginal side visited the UK, as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations, and it was a full 128 years after the 1868 tour before Australia fielded its first acknowledged Aboriginal test representative, Jason Gillespie, in 1996. The 1868 tour clearly provided little lasting legacy for Aboriginal cricket.  For all the difficulties they faced and the fact that one of the team died, Mallett believes the Aboriginal players genuinely enjoyed the tour, partly because they were treated with more respect than they were accustomed to at home.  It would certainly have been different from their work as agricultural labourers in Australia.  ""If we are looking for an analogy it would have been akin to us being gathered up and flown in a space ship to the moon.""  You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

He started off as little more than a substitute but started the final three qualifying games and looks a key part of Mick McCarthy's plans.

658,"Timothy McVeigh has shown no remorse for the 1995 Oklahoma bombing which killed 168 people and injured more than 500. BBC News Online's Lucy Walker profiles the former US army marksman who carried out the worst peacetime attack on US soil. In the hours after the Oklahoma bombing, commentators first suspected it was the work of a fundamentalist Middle Eastern terrorist group. But an FBI agent named Clinton Van Zandt was closer to the truth. He had been the FBI's chief hostage negotiator at Waco and recognised the significance of the date - 19 April 1995. It was two years to the day since federal troops ended a 51-day siege at a Branch Davidian sect compound near Waco, Texas, in which 82 people died. Van Zandt is quoted as saying then that the bomber would turn out to be a white male, acting alone, or with one other person, and in his mid-20s. He would have military experience and be angry at the government for what happened at Waco. Timothy McVeigh was born in 1968 and grew up the middle of three children in a conservative, rural community in Pendleton, New York, near the decaying industrial centre of Buffalo. His father, Bill, like his father before him, worked at the General Motors radiator factory and provided conscientiously for his family, but was distant and unadventurous. When he was 10, his mother, Mildred ""Mickey"" McVeigh, left home. McVeigh says that while his sisters, then 12 and four, moved to Florida with their mother, he opted to live with his father ""so he wouldn't be alone"". McVeigh was very bright, not top of his class, but a solid student.    I reached the decision to go on the offensive - to put a check on government abuse of power, where others had failed in stopping the federal juggernaut running amok    Classmates recall a shy, skinny youth who did not socialise much. There seems to have been only one girlfriend during his high school years. Later, during 75 hours of interviews, he would tell journalists Lou Michael and Dan Herbeck - authors of American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing - that he always said the wrong thing to women he was trying to impress. He left school in 1986 and dropped out of college soon after. The economy was in a slump, the radiator factory had stopped hiring and McVeigh took a series of dead-end jobs, working in a burger bar and as a security guard in Buffalo. He began collecting guns while still at school and after he left devoured right-wing, pro-militia magazines like Solider of Fortune and Spotlight. An even stronger influence was The Turner Diaries, a racist, anti-Semitic novel which tells the story of a gun enthusiast who reacts against tighter gun laws and starts a revolution by packing a van with home made explosives and blowing up the FBI headquarters in Washington. McVeigh embarked on a flirtation with the militia movement, which believes that ordinary Americans are under imminent threat of attack, from nuclear war, communists or central government. He began to stockpile food, water and guns and in 1988 he and a friend bought 10 acres of woodland where they practised shooting and planned to build a bunker. At 20 he joined the army - one of the reasons being, according to Michael and Herbeck, to improve his shooting and survival skills. It gave him an environment where he could indulge his passion for guns and in many ways he became the perfect soldier. Colleagues say he was polite, efficient and a top marksman. He kept a spare uniform just so that he could look smart at inspections and showed more interest in cleaning his collection of guns than girls or beer. In 1992 he was sent to the Gulf as a gunner, where he won praise and respect from those around him and earned both the Combat Infantry Badge and Bronze Star. He won a commendation for his action in shooting an Iraqi tank commander more than a mile away, armed with his favourite weapon - a small cannon. The book says he was satisfied at hitting the target but adds McVeigh got no thrill out of the act of killing. He admits to killing two Iraqis, but was upset at what he saw as the needless death of countless Iraqis at the end of the Gulf War. The army, he says, taught him how to switch off his emotions. McVeigh was tipped for promotion and on his return, he tried to join the elite Green Berets. He took a battery of IQ, personality and aptitude tests, but, out of condition from lack of exercise in the Gulf, found the physical rigours of the training camp too tough and dropped out after two days. Disillusioned, he went back to the regular army but soon gave up and returned to live with his father.    Borrowing a page from US foreign policy, I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile, by bombing a government building and the government employees within that building who represent that government    McVeigh took a series of dead-end jobs and followed gun shows across the country. Drifting between Pendleton and the homes of his ex-army chums: Terry Nichols in Decker, Michigan; and Michael Fortier in Klingman, Arizona, he made some money selling guns at gun fairs. There he would certainly have come into contact with anti-tax, anti-government, racist and militia groups, but there is nothing to suggest that he ever signed-up to any of them. McVeigh was distressed by the 1992 catastrophe at Ruby Ridge - a siege and shootout where federal officials shot and killed the wife of survivalist Randy Weaver and their 14-year-old son. But it was the storming of the Branch Davidian compound at Waco the following year that provoked him into acting on his frustrations. McVeigh travelled to Waco to see the siege for himself and was horrified by the final showdown when federal troops fired tear gas and a massive fire engulfed the compound. Both events have been painted by militia movements as evidence of a federal clampdown, with more to come. While on death row, McVeigh asked a friend to pass on to a London newspaper a three-page letter detailing why he carried out the bombing. In the letter, entitled ""Why I bombed the Murrah building"", he explains that he lost patience after waiting for the government to apologise for Waco. ""I reached the decision to go on the offensive - to put a check on government abuse of power, where others had failed in stopping the federal juggernaut running amok,"" he said. ""Borrowing a page from US foreign policy, I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile, by bombing a government building and the government employees within that building who represent that government."" To the end, he has been aware of his media profile. His request to have his execution broadcast on national television was turned down, but he has been corresponding with journalists by e-mail and personally invited the writer Gore Vidal, on assignment for Vanity Fair, to witness his execution. He has also played down the roles of his co-conspirators, although Fortier went with him to reconnoitre the building and Nichols helped make the fuel-oil and fertiliser explosives. McVeigh emerged at his trial as intelligent and sane. He has never expressed remorse, although he has hinted that he regrets the deaths of the 19 children. After examining him in prison, psychiatrist Dr John Smith concluded that prisoner 12076-064 was a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible, violent act."

International Rugby Board chairman Dr Syd Millar said one of the reasons was to cut down on fixture congestion.  ""This will reduce the potential number of games that have to be played in the years before a tournament,"" he said.  He also said it would help raise the standard of the game in countries outside the Home Nations and Tri-Nations and make games in this year's tournament more meaningful.  ""It raises the prospect of several Tier Two unions qualifying automatically,"" he added.

660,"Sue Lawley's castaway this week is the impressionist and satirist Rory Bremner. He was born in Edinburgh in 1961. A self-confessed show-off, he started doing impersonations at primary school, sending up teachers, sports commentators and Moira Anderson! Entertaining his school friends inevitably developed into performing on stage and he worked as a stand up on the comedy circuit, and notably at the Edinburgh Festival.  Following his sell-out run at the Festival in 1986 the BBC offered him his first television series, Now Something Else. It ran on BBC2 for seven years. In 1993 he moved to Channel 4, where his show Rory Bremner - Who Else? developed a much more hard-edged, satirical and political bite. It also picked up more than 10 major awards including Baftas for himself and fellow writer-performers John Bird and John Fortune. His meticulous research and observation of the politicians he mimics inevitably led to his fraternising with them and ultimately led to being awarded the final accolade for a satirist: he was banned from Labour's battle bus in the 2001 election campaign.

661,"Goldstein, an immigrant from New York City, had been a physician in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.  Waving semi-automatic weapons in the air, the celebrants danced, sang and read prayers around his grave.  ""We decided to make a big party on the day he was murdered by Arabs,"" said Baruch Marzel, one of about 40 celebrants.  The tribute was a macabre twist on the Jewish festival of Purim, when it is a custom to dress in costume and celebrate.  In 1994 on Purim, Goldstein stormed a mosque and fired on praying Muslims in the West Bank city's Tomb of the Patriarchs - a shrine sacred to both Muslims and Jews.  Twenty-nine people died in the attack, and the angry crowd lynched Goldstein in retaliation.  Israeli extremists continue to pay homage at his grave in the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, where a marble plaque reads: ""To the holy Baruch Goldstein, who gave his life for the Jewish people, the Torah and the nation of Israel.""  About 10,000 people had visited the grave since the massacre, Mr Marzel said."
662,"German carmaker Daimler is to give Renault and Nissan a 3.1% stake in its business as part of a global tie-up of the brands, it has been announced. In exchange, Daimler will take a 3.1% stakes in both Renault and Nissan, who have been in an alliance since 1999. The deal will see the companies remain separate, but allow them to share technology and development costs. The carmakers will co-operate to make electric cars and light commercial vehicles, Nissan said. Commenting on the deal, Daimler's chairman Dr Dieter Zetsche said it was ""a promising foundation"" that would allow the companies to share resources. ""Our skills complement each other very well,"" he said. ""We know that we can make brand-typical products based on shared architectures. The individual brand identities will remain unaffected."" The name of the game is to be present everywhere    Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan Alliance The companies will co-operate on the development of the Smart car brand - made by Daimler - and a new Renault Twingo, including electric versions, the companies said. Engines currently made by Renault-Nissan will also be modified to fit a new range of compact Mercedes Benz cars. The companies said that the cars would be based on ""jointly-developed architecture"", but would still differ from each other in terms of product design. Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, said the new tie-up would be able to benefit from Renault and Nissan's positive experience. Carlos Ghosn says alliances are the future for the car industry ""The Renault-Nissan Alliance knows how to work successfully in collaborative partnerships,"" he said. Speaking to reporters, Mr Ghosn said the modern car market demanded that manufacturers enter into these types of agreements. ""This industry is moving more and more towards increasing scale, and sharing innovation and investment,"" he said. ""The name of the game is to be present everywhere. You have to be present in all of the emerging markets, and in every segment in those markets."" ""No small or medium car manufacturer can afford that.""

663,"Mr Tadic, the first Serbian president in Sarajevo since the war ended in 1995, said war crimes suspects should face justice at The Hague tribunal.  But he stressed that individuals, not the Serb nation, committed crimes, and that Serbs too had suffered.  The Bosnian Serb Republic has yet to hand over any war crimes suspects.  This failure is likely to lead to the entity's continued exclusion from Nato's Partnership for Peace when Nato defence ministers meet on Thursday to discuss Bosnia's proposed admission.  Bosnia is shared between the Serb Republic and a Muslim-Croat federation.  Mr Tadic met members of the tripartite Bosnian presidency at the start of a three-day visit.  ""I apologise to all those who suffered from crimes committed in the name of the Serb people,"" he said after the meeting. ""However, the Serb people did not commit these crimes but rather criminal individuals.""  He said it was now up to others to apologise.  ""It is impossible to blame one nation for this because the same crimes had been committed against the Serbs.  ""In this context we all need to apologise to one another, and if I need to be the first to do so here I am.""  The president of Serbia-Montenegro - the loose union which replaced Yugoslavia last year - has already apologised in Bosnia.  Svetozar Marovic, a Montenegrin, said in November 2003 that both sides should be prepared to forgive and move forward.

664,"The mooted offer would trump a deal that was agreed with the UK's Barclays.  Barclays planned to merge with ABN in a move that would create one of the world's biggest banks, valued at £94bn.  RBS and its allies, which are Spain's Santander and Belgium's Fortis, are proposing a deal worth 72bn euros (£49bn; $98bn), or 39 euros a share.  ABN directors have invited members of the consortium to a meeting to discuss its proposals.  In London, RBS saw its stock dip 0.7% to 1,998 pence, while Barclays gained 1.6% to 724p.  The deal, should it be formalised, would be financed by 70% cash and 30% of RBS shares.  RBS said it was worth about 13% more than the offer put forward by Barclays.  Some analysts have questioned whether Barclays would be able to table a higher offer.  ""The battle over ABN broke out in earnest this morning,"" said the BBC's business editor Robert Peston.  According to the RBS group, a formal bid would only happen if ABN Amro halted plans to sell its US operations, LaSalle, to Bank of America (BoA).  ""RBS will act prudently and will only proceed if it is in the best interest of shareholders to do so,"" the bank's chairman Sir Tom McKillop said at the firm's annual general meeting.  The sale of LaSalle was a key part of the merger deal that Barclays secured, and had angered many shareholders who saw the $21bn ( £10.5bn) sale as a poison pill put in place to put off rival bidders.  ABN said on Wednesday that it was possible for another buyer to be found for LaSalle, but only if the offer topped Bank of America's.  ""ABN and its advisers are actively engaged in soliciting alternative bids from the largest US and international banks that may have an interest in LaSalle,"" the Dutch lender said.  A rival bidder has 14 days to come up with a counter-bid for LaSalle; BoA can then match it within five business days should it want to.  BoA would be in line for a $200m ""break-up"" fee should its purchase of LaSalle fall apart but the firm said it expects the deal to be ""fulfilled under its current terms"".  ""If this was a fair fight and there wasn't this poison pill, this would be an open and shut case as of this morning,"" said Alex Potter, an analyst at Collins Stewart.  ""However, dealing with the way the LaSalle sale has been constructed, it's all about whether there is some way of that being withdrawn,"" he added.  According to the BBC's business editor, ABN will not want to halt the sale of LaSalle, and will view RBS as ""a hostile invading force rather than an institution trying to offer more money to its owners than Barclays"".  UK hedge fund TCI, which has been critic of ABN's performance and strategy, was quick to give its backing to the RBS-led group.  ""The board of ABN must allow the RBS consortium full access to conduct due diligence immediately,"" TCI said. ""The board must recommend the RBS consortium offer, subject to the diligence condition being met.""  RBS and its supporters claim that their deal would entail fewer risks and could offer a better fit with ABN's existing operations.  ""The banks believe that the potential transaction will create stronger businesses with enhanced market positions and growth prospects in each of ABN's main markets,"" it said.  Should the group table a successful bid, then its is expected to break up ABN, with RBS taking LaSalle, Santander getting Italian and Brazilian operations, and Fortis running ABN's Dutch and Belgian retail business.  ""The gloves are now off and ABN finds itself in a difficult situation,"" said Richard Hunter of Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The significantly higher consortium offer cannot be ignored.""  ""The general synergies seem to favour the consortium bid, even after Barclays' head start on proceedings,"" he added."

The world record for runs off one over is held by Jonathan Hughes - who got 42, also in a club cricket match, for North Leeds in 2005.

It is the 25th anniversary of the furry rodent-like creatures' debut on television, and they have a new series starting next year. New members of the clan to join Orinoco, Wellington, Bongo, Tomsk and Great Uncle Bulgaria include Alderney. She shuns Womble convention by living up a tree instead of in the burrow, rides a skateboard, and wears a trendy baggy jumper. She is joined by Stepney, a wide-boy Cockney. The new Wombles communicate with other Wombles by Womfax, and travel about Wimbledon Common in the Womcopter. Elizabeth Beresford, who has just met the new Wombles And those are not the only changes - the new series of the former BBC stalwart is to be shown on ITV, starting on March 4. The Wombles' creator, Elizabeth Beresford, posed with characters from the new series in Wimbledon today. Mrs Beresford was visiting London to collect her MBE from Buckingham Palace. The characters were inspired by Elizabeth Beresford's own family. Great Uncle Bulgaria was based on her father-in-law, and Tobermory was her brother. The first Wombles book came out in 1968. The BBC decided to make a series after it proved popular on Jackanory. They first appeared on TV in 1973. Mrs Beresford was paid £50 for each of the first 35 episodes. She then wrote another 30 for £75 a time. But - at the height of their success - the Wombles earned a reputed £17 million per year. The Wombles have been translated into 40 languages. The last book - Wombling Free - came out in 1978. The Wombles had eight Top Ten hits - all in 1974 and 1975. They include The Wombling Song and Remember You're A Womble. The TV Wombles are just nine inches tall. There were complaints from local Wimbledon residents that the Wombles actually encouraged children to drop litter on the Common.

668,"The first team of Pakistani climbers to scale the world's second tallest mountain, K2, has arrived at the summit.  K2 lies in Pakistan, near the northern border with China. The climbers made it to the summit at 02:30 (22:30 GMT on Friday).  Mountaineers regard K2 as more challenging to conquer than Mount Everest, the world's highest peak.  Correspondents say descending from the top is more dangerous.  The Pakistani climbers were undertaking their expedition on the 60th anniversary of the first successful ascent of K2.  Two Italians - Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli - reached the top of K2 on 31 July 1954.  The current expedition - called K2 60 Years Later - includes six Pakistanis: Hassan Jan, Ali Durani, Rahmat Ullah Baig, Ghulam Mehdi, Ali and Muhammad Sadiq. Three Italians are also part of the group.  Individual Pakistan climbers have reached the top before - but this is Pakistan's first successful team attempt.  The BBC's Shahzeb Jillani in Islamabad says many have died returning to the base camp in the past as the descent is trickier.

670,"A health watchdog has reported a ""systemic failure to protect people"" at a hospital where alleged abuse was secretly filmed by the BBC.  The Care Quality Commission (CQC) published its findings after an inspection of Winterbourne View near Bristol.  The review was ordered after BBC Panorama filmed patients being pinned down, slapped and taunted.  Police said they had arrested a 12th person in connection with the inquiry.  The Panorama programme was contacted by whistleblower Terry Bryan who alerted the BBC with his concerns about some staff.  Mr Bryan, a senior nurse, acted after his concerns were not followed up by the home's management or the CQC.  The CQC report on Winterbourne View found owners Castlebeck Care had failed to ensure residents living at the unit were adequately protected from risk, including the risks of unsafe practices by its own staff.  It said: ""There was a systemic failure to protect people or to investigate allegations of abuse.  ""The provider had failed in its legal duty to notify the Care Quality Commission of serious incidents including injuries to patients or occasions when they had gone missing.""  Inspectors also noted staff did not appear to understand the needs of the people in their care and said ""some staff were too ready to use methods of restraint without considering alternatives"".  Winterbourne View was closed down in June.  The CQC's director of operations Amanda Sherlock said that, following the investigation, it was clear the abuse was far worse than they were warned of by Mr Bryan.  She claimed that Castlebeck had ""misled"" the CQC, and if officials had known about what was taking place they ""could have taken action earlier"".  In response to the CQC report, Castlebeck's Chief Executive, Lee Reed, said: ""We are truly sorry for the failures which led to the terrible mistreatment suffered by patients at Winterbourne View.  ""As soon as the company was made aware of the appalling misconduct of staff at Winterbourne View, we alerted the police and other relevant authorities.  ""We then took immediate remedial steps to safeguard the welfare of all our service users. This work is ongoing, and is our absolute priority.""  The latest person to be arrested is a 27-year-old man from the South Gloucestershire area.  Police said he had been arrested under the Mental Capacity Act and had been released on police bail.  Eleven other people, eight men and three women, previously arrested remain on police bail pending further inquiries."
671,"Peter Butler at London's Royal Free Hospital said he was ""delighted"" to get the go-ahead from an NHS ethics board for an operation ""within months"".  No patient has been selected for the procedure, although the team has been approached by about 30 patients.  Last November Isabelle Dinoire from France became the first person to receive a partial face transplant.  She had her nose, lips and chin torn off after being mauled by the family dog.  Mr Butler said the go-ahead for the first full face transplant ""had been a long journey, but this is just the beginning, really"".  ""The most important part of the process starts now, which is selection of the patients,"" he added.  Mr Butler is now looking to draw up a shortlist of candidates who meet the selection criteria for the operation, which includes an assessment of how they will deal with its psychological impact.  His team will select four patients from the UK or Ireland for the procedure, and the operations will be carried out at six month intervals.  He said he would not be able to carry out the operation on children, because of issues of consent.  He said: ""These patients will have already undergone reconstructive surgery - perhaps they will have had 50 to 70 reconstructive operations.  ""They have reached the end of the reconstructive ladder and there's nothing more it can offer them.  ""Then they have the problem of integration into society, of being able to walk down the street in society without anybody staring at them. That's all these people want - to be normal.""  The ethics committee at the London hospital looked at whether the surgery and subsequent immune suppression would be safe, and whether any patient would be able to cope with the psychological impact.  Mr Butler has been researching face transplants for several years, looking at issues such as tissue rejection, psychological issues and concern surrounding identity.  The operation will involve removing skin, underlying fat and eight different blood vessels, four arteries and four veins from a donor patient.  The face will then be reconnected to the recipient in a procedure which will last several hours.  After the operation, the patient will have to take immunosuppressant drugs to stop their body from rejecting the new tissue.  Computer modelling carried out by Mr Butler has shown that the recipient of a full face transplant would look different to the donor because of their face shape and bone structure.  Simon Weston, the Falklands veteran whose face was badly burnt during the conflict, welcomed the Royal Free's decision. He told the BBC: ""I'm absolutely delighted. This has been long fought for.""  Chris Caddy, of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, also welcomed the decision.  He said: ""Aesthetic replacement of the deformed or destroyed face has been a Holy Grail for plastic surgeons, with teams across the world exploring all aspects of this challenging process for the last 10 years.""  But the Royal College of Surgeons said: ""The college still has grave concerns about face transplantation and will continue to advocate a cautious approach.""  A spokesman said the college would draw up ""minimum requirements"" that would need to be met before any transplant is undertaken, and urged the Royal Free to delay surgery until its review had taken place.  And Changing Faces, a charity that supports and represents people with disfigurements, said: ""Our main concern is to ensure that any patient who is being considered for this procedure has a full understanding of the risks and benefits."""

""But he has changed his car for one that has lower carbon emissions and has also made other personal changes to help the environment, such as making his new home more energy-efficient and changing his electricity supply to renewable energy.""  Mr Cameron has swapped his government-provided Vauxhall Omega - with emissions of 276g per kilometre - for a commercially-leased Lexus with a hybrid engine giving off 186g.  But critics say he should have taken a Toyota Prius, which emits 104g per kilometre.  Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Chris Huhne said Mr Cameron's behaviour made a nonsense of his commitment to cycling as the greenest way to get to work.  ""If everyone with green leanings now needs a shoe chauffeur the environment will be ruined,"" he said.  ""As a matter of urgency, I will personally buy and deliver to Mr Cameron a pannier for him to put over his back wheels so that he can cycle to work while leaving his shoe chauffeur at home.""  Mr Cameron is focusing on local issues in his constituency on Friday. Shadow foreign secretary William Hague and shadow chancellor George Osborne are out on the national campaign trail.  Mr Hague is visiting a regeneration project in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire while Mr Osborne is campaigning in Birmingham."
673,"Fans have launched numerous protests against the club's debts The Red Knights group eyeing a possible bid for Manchester United will be advised by investment bank Nomura, the Japanese firm has said. The group of financiers has met the football club's supporters, who have been running a vocal campaign to bring about a change of ownership. Manchester United was bought by the Glazer family for £800m in 2005. The Nomura team will be led by two bankers who advised the club at the time of the Glazers' takeover. ""Nomura will work closely with the Red Knights, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust and other potential investors to co-ordinate and formulate the proposal to be put to the Glazer family,"" the financiers said in a statement. ""Nomura is beginning its role by contacting the many expressions of financial support the Red Knights have received to date."" ""Ultimately they would like to get hundreds of thousands of potential members around the world and for each of them to have a stake in the club,"" said BBC Sport's Dan Roan. ""It's unprecedented - we've seen it happen in Spain with Madrid and Barcelona, but to actually buy the club off a tycoon is a new one. ""They quite like the idea of this club being democratic - they think its part of a campaign that may sweep through football."" The Glazers' reign has been controversial, with many fans opposed to the huge levels of debt that Red Football, the club's holding firm, took on to finance the takeover. Red Football now has more than £700m of debts. Fans protesting against the Glazers have been wearing green and gold scarves - the colours of Newton Heath before it was renamed Manchester United in 1902 - at games this season.     "
674,"   Three couples became two as Mark Ramprakash and partner Karen Hardy together with Matt Dawson and Lilia Kopylova won a place in the Strictly Come Dancing final on BBC One. The two sportsmen will now battle it out to win the coveted title of Strictly Come Dancing Champion 2006. Emma Bunton didn't get what she really, really wanted tonight (Saturday 16 December) as she was booted off the show - even though she came second in the competition scoring a total of 69 out of 80. Emma and partner Darren Bennett performed the Salsa and the Argentine Tango. Of Emma and Darren's Argentine Tango the judges said - Bruno: ""The choreography was superb. Some of the lunges were so clean and precise I don't know how you did it in a week - actually four days. What a great job."" Len: ""With this dance you want to go back to Buenos Aires... meeting with the ladies of the night, lots of passion. I must say occasionally you were a little unsure but all the drama was there, the steps were there. Very, very well done."" Craig: ""I have to agree with Len and Bruno. It was absolutely phenomenal. Intimate, sensual I felt like I was looking through a key hole. There was tension."" Arlene: ""I thought it was a technical masterpiece. But for me it completely lacked intimate desire. There was none of that secret language going on. Wonderfully technical but nothing more."" And of Emma and Darren's Salsa the judges said - Bruno: ""Well, Emma, girl power is alive and well. Feisty, great fun, a party dance. I enjoyed every minute."" Craig: ""I just wanted to comment on some improvement. I don't think anyone has said how much you've improved. You're using the floor much better. I would have liked to see you dance more together."" Arlene: ""Well, I disagree with Bruno, although great to see your hips move, you were too far apart."" Bruno: ""All the fun was there."" Arlene: ""I wanted to see them more together. I didn't see that."" Len: ""The parts when you were together were stronger and had much more energy than when you were apart."" Emma said: ""To be the last female in the competition is astounding. I am so proud. ""Darren has been like my brother. We've become so close. I can't imagine not having Darren in my life now. ""Doing this show has taught me confidence and not to worry about every little thing."" All the couples performed a dance they had not done before as well as the Argentine Tango - which was new to both the professionals and the celebrities. Mark and Karen impressed the judges with their Argentine Tango scoring an amazing 39 out of 40, which coupled with their Quickstep gave them a total of 73 out of 80. Sir Cliff Richard performed live on the show with a special dance performance by Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace. Next week the finalists will perform a show dance, their best ballroom and best Latin dances of the series. And all of the celebrities and dancers from the series will return to perform on the final night - Saturday 23 December. Tonight Strictly Come Dancing was awarded a Critics' Circle National Dance Award - The Patron's Award. It is given to the individual or organisation that has significantly furthered the cause of dance in the UK. The award was presented to hosts Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly and the show's producer Sam Donnelley by legendary ballerina Dame Beryl Grey, patron of the National Dance Awards. This evening there were more than 2 million phone votes on the night alone. Don't forget you can get all the up to date gossip on the sister show It Takes Two, weekdays at 6.30pm on BBC Two, and also via bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing.

675,"Four people including a Muslim cleric have been arrested in Bangladesh in connection with the death of 14-year-old girl who was publicly lashed.  The teenager was accused of having an affair with a married man, police say, and the punishment was given under Islamic Sharia law.  Hena Begum's family members said a village court consisting of elders and clerics passed the sentence.  She was alleged to have had the affair with her cousin and received 80 lashes.  The family members of the married man also allegedly beat the girl up a day before the village court passed the sentence in the district of Shariatpur.  ""Her family members said she was admitted to a hospital after the incident and she died six days later. The village elders also asked the girl's father to pay a fine of about 50,000 Taka (£430; $700),"" district superintendent of police, AKM Shahidur Rahman, told the BBC.  He said it had not been established yet whether she died because of the punishment she received or another reason.  ""We are still waiting for the post-mortem report. In the meantime, we are also looking for another 14 people including a teacher from a local madrassa in connection with this case,"" Mr Rahman said.  Activists say dozens of fatwas - or religious rulings - are issued under Sharia law each year by village clergy in Bangladesh.  ""What sort of justice is this? My daughter has been beaten to death in the name of justice. If it had been a proper court then my daughter would not have died,"" Dorbesh Khan, the father of Hena Begum, told the BBC.  He said those responsible for the death should be punished.  A group of people held a rally on Wednesday in the town of Shariatpur in protest against those who gave the fatwa and demanded action against them.  This is the second reported fatality linked to a Sharia law punishment since the practice was outlawed last year by the High Court.  A 40-year-old woman in the district of Rajshahi died in December, days after she was publicly caned for allegedly having an affair with her stepson.  Nearly 90% of Bangladesh's estimated 160 million population are Muslims, most of whom practise a moderate version of Islam."
676,"A level crossing in Berkshire where eight people have been killed since 2004 could be replaced with a bridge, Network Rail has said.  Route managing director Patrick Holgate said a bridge could replace the half-barrier crossing at Ufton Nervet as part of a rail electrification scheme.  He added a decision would be made in ""about three or four months"".  In 2004 a train derailed at Ufton Nervet, killing seven, and in May a man on a moped died at the crossing.  Mr Holgate said: ""We are currently due to renew the crossing and are currently looking at all options - from a like-for-like renewal, which would happen on most occasions, to a full barrier, and even consideration for a bridge.""  He added the benefits of replacing the half-barrier crossing with a full barrier would also be weighed up.  ""The issue from a road traffic perspective is that the barriers would be down longer,"" he said, ""from a railway perspective it would mean we could increase the line speed"".  He said Network Rail would consult with West Berkshire Council and the public, but added putting up a bridge at Ufton Nervet ""seems a fairly standard possibility"".  Meanwhile West Berkshire Liberal Democrat councillors have started a petition calling for a safer crossing at the site, following the death of a moped rider in May when he was hit by a train.  In the crash in November 2004, seven people died and 130 were injured.  There was another incident at the same spot in September last year, which was a near miss between a train and a car."
677,"A new law has just come into force in Austria, to make immigrants take compulsory German lessons and citizenship classes.  The measures are to be applied not just to new immigrants but to foreigners who have lived in this country since 1998.  Failure to attend the classes could, in some cases, lead to people's residence visas not being renewed. They could face fines or even deportation.  Some immigrants have reacted angrily to the new law.  ""Force is not nice, you know,"" says Drayan from the Seychelles.  ""To learn a new language as an adult is not the same as when you are young. If they want us to learn it fast this is not possible.""  The new law - known as the integration contract - follows years of stormy debate in Austria over the question of immigration, frequently inflamed by the far-right Freedom Party.  The far right suffered heavy losses in the recent general election, but the new law has the full support of the conservative People's Party, which won a landslide victory.  ""For the conservative party it is very important that people who come to our country to stay here are as well integrated as possible,"" explained Maria Rauch Kalla, People's Party general Secretary.  ""One of the most important issues in integration is to understand and be able to speak the language.  ""So with a small amount of goodwill everybody can manage that. If there is no threat, maybe there are some people who won't do it at all.""  But the new plans have drawn heavy criticism from the opposition and human rights groups.  Lobbying at the Cafe Landtmann, one of Vienna's political hubs, Heinz Stieb of People's Aid Austria says the measures impose too many duties on immigrants and create an atmosphere of fear.  ""We are dealing with people - not machines,"" he says. ""Different people need different time to adapt to a new society.""  Some immigrants, he says, are struggling with poverty and illiteracy, so learning German ""might not be number one on their shopping list"".  ""If you put people under obligation to attend German courses while they are desperately seeking a job, or are working 60 hours a week, how can they attend?"" asks Mr Stieb.  ""You need to give them time and you need to assist them in a way that they can accept this assistance and not put them under obligation and call it help.""  Some residents of Vienna also point out that integration is not just the responsibility of the new immigrants - he says Austrians have to play a more active role.  ""Austria is not really such an open society as Great Britain for instance,"" says Klaus, laden with shopping,  There is more to integration, it seems, than just learning a language."
678,"She was taken to nearby Charing Cross Hospital, where she was confirmed dead on arrival at 1303 BST (1203 GMT).  Her post mortem examination later revealed that she had received a single gunshot wound to the head.  There had been early reports that she suffered multiple stab wounds, but one neighbour in Gowan Avenue said he had heard a gunshot.  Ms Dando's fiancé, gynaecologist Alan Farthing, said: ''I am totally devastated and unable to comprehend what has happened. Jill was respected for her professional ability, admired by all who met her and adored by anyone who got to know her.''  Police, who have launched a murder inquiry, later cordoned off the footpath next to the River Thames from Putney Bridge.  There were unconfirmed reports that a man jumped off the bridge, or was stopped as he tried to jump.  He was described as white, tall, in his late 30s or early 40s, with dark hair, clean-shaven and wearing a green Barbour jacket.  Richard Hughes, 32, who lives next door to Miss Dando, said: ""I heard her scream, it was a distinctive scream, she sounded quite surprised.  ""I went to the door and saw her lying on the doorstep, she was unconscious and covered in blood. I was obviously shocked. I took a look at her and she wasn't breathing.""  Jill Dando was hugely popular among BBC viewers, her bright presenting style proving a hit in a variety of programmes.  BBC News Online received more than 2,000 tributes from users within three hours of posting a page on the Internet.  Her co-presenter on Crimewatch UK, Nick Ross, said: ""The shock is palpable. I can't believe we are talking about her in the past tense.""  Ms Dando and Nick Ross presented last week's show, which featured unsolved crimes including the Brixton nail bomb blast.  Scotland Yard said there was no evidence that linked the murder with the programme.  Last year there were reports that Ms Dando had been stalked by a fan, who had subjected her to frightening phone calls and letters.  Tony Hall, chief executive of BBC News, said: ""I think we have to think carefully about people in the public eye and what protection if any they should have.""  ""But we are conscious not just of our own great sorrow, but of all of those viewers who learned to love her.""  But after seven years touring the world's tourist spots for the Holiday programme, Ms Dando was due to scale down her on-screen work and wed Mr Farthing."
679,"Ieuan Wyn Jones has revealed he will stand down as Plaid Cymru leader in the first half of the Welsh assembly's five-year term.  He said it had always been his intention to leave the role at some point before the next election in 2016.  The announcement follows a poor showing for Plaid at last week's election when it lost four seats.  Former Plaid president Lord Elis-Thomas has said he would allow his name to go forward as a leadership candidate.  Speaking at Beaumaris in his Anglesey constituency, Mr Jones said it had been a great honour to lead the party over the past 11 years.  I don't think anyone within or outside Plaid Cymru thought Ieuan Wyn Jones would be there to lead the party into the next assembly election in 2016. What's interesting is that he felt the need to make these comments publicly. People would have said: 'Why does he need to do this?' It's maybe because there's some pressure from some parts of the party for an early contest and what he's doing basically is saying: 'Look, don't worry about it. I'm going but let's do it in an ordered way. Let's get the review of why we did so badly in the assembly elections out of the way first'. So he's really trying to pre-empt any pressure for an early departure. Dafydd Elis Thomas has put his hat in the ring. That maybe is an attempt to force an early contest. There is a problem on Plaid Cymru's left wing in that many of their big beasts are out of the assembly at the moment. Helen Mary Jones lost in Llanelli, and Adam Price, the former MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, isn't in the assembly. In terms of other names you've got two former ministers Alun Ffred Jones and Elin Jones, former MP Simon Thomas and some people are banking on a total newbie, Llyr Huws Gruffydd, the new North Wales AM. But an early contest would be a big test for him.  The timetable for his departure means Mr Jones will go some time in the next two-and-a-half years.  In a statement delivered in front of party colleagues, he said the ""time was right"" for him to make his plans clear.  He said it had been an honour to lead the party and to serve as deputy first minister in the coalition with Labour in the last assembly.  ""I have also witnessed many historic and momentous events during that period, not least leading the party into government for the first time in its 86-year history and the referendum on law-making powers,"" he said.  Mr Jones was MP for Ynys Mon from 1987 to 2001 and has been the island's AM since the first assembly in 1999. He first took up the party leadership in 2000.  Last week's election saw Plaid slump to 11 seats, its worst tally since the assembly was established.  There has been criticism that the party's campaign was too negative by attacking its former coalition partners in Labour.  Mr Jones said the result was a ""disappointment"", adding: ""As leader I take my share of the responsibility for those results.  ""The party obviously needs time to reflect on the results, look long and hard at our message, our party structures and campaigning abilities.""  Lord Elis-Thomas said if Plaid activists in his Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency want his name to go forward as a candidate for the leadership he would give them a ""straight answer"".  ""I am afraid that they have decided to ask me the question,"" he told BBC Radio Wales.  Lord Elis-Thomas, who was leader of Plaid between 1984 and 1991, will speak to party officials in Porthmadog on Friday night. He ended a 12-year stint as the assembly's presiding officer this week.  Mr Jones said he was confident Plaid would recover ""stronger and better, provided we understand the need to change and modernise"".  An immediate leadership election would not be in the party's interest because of the need to review the election result, he said.  He thanked his family for their support, including his wife Eirian - ""a rock through it all"" - and his three children and four grandchildren.  Former Plaid chairman John Dixon, who left the party earlier this year because he was unhappy with its direction, said Mr Jones has made the right decision to quit.  He told BBC Wales his departure was inevitable and that it will be a chance for the party to decide what it stands for.  Plaid Westminster leader Elfyn Llwyd said: ""He has shown great commitment and dedication to the party over the years. Wales has come a long way and so has Plaid Cymru.""  First Minister Carwyn Jones said: ""I worked well with Ieuan Wyn Jones in the four years we were in government together and I wish him well in whatever he does next. I have always known Ieuan to be a decent man and his party will find him hard to replace."""
680,"A gardener died after apparently handling a deadly plant on an estate in Hampshire, a coroner has heard.  Nathan Greenway's legal team believe he had touched the poisonous wild plant Aconitum napellus, also known as Monkshood, at Mill Court House, Alton.  The 33-year-old, from Aldershot, died in hospital five days later on 7 September from multiple organ failure.  The pre-inquest hearing in Basingstoke was adjourned until a date yet to be fixed.  North East Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said the circumstances surrounding the death would be investigated at the full inquest.  Mr Greenway worked on the estate in Upper Froyle.  Mill Court House is owned by Christopher William Ogilvie Thompson and his wife Kathy.  The Aconitum napellus plant has dark purple flowers and often grows in gardens in Europe.  Poisoning from aconite is rare and usually happens when the plant, also known as Devil's Helmet, is eaten accidentally.  Symptoms of aconite poisoning appear quickly after a poisonous dose is consumed. These include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and numbness of the face.  In severe cases, the numbness can spread to the limbs and muscles can weaken. It also causes hypotension, chest pain and palpitations.  It can cause abnormal rapid heart rhythms and can stop the heart from beating."
681,"Makwan Mouloudzadeh, 20, had been found guilty of raping three teenage boys when he was 13 years old.  The hanging took place on Wednesday morning at a prison in Kermanshah province in western Iran.  Human rights groups say international law strictly forbids execution of child offenders, even after they become 18.  ""On 11 November the head of the justice administration of Kermanshah received an order from the judiciary head, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, to stop the verdict being carried out,"" the lawyer, Saeed Eqbali, was quoted as saying.  ""But the case, which was supposed to be reviewed in Tehran, was sent back from there to Kermanshah, and the execution was carried out quickly,"" the lawyer said.  Clarisa Bencomo of the Human Rights Watch (HRW) group told Reuters news agency she had received information that Mr Mouloudzadeh's family had been told to come and pick up his body.  Her organisation had spoken to people who had seen the body, she said.  HRW says Mr Mouloudzadeh was arrested in September 2006 after three men complained to police he had raped them seven years earlier.  During court proceedings, Mr Mouloudzadeh withdrew a confession he had made earlier, saying it had been the result of coercion by the police, the US-based group says.  As a state that is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Iran has undertaken not to execute child offenders.  But Amnesty International says Iran has executed five minors so far in 2007 and 27 minors since 1990.  The latest execution brings to at least 280 the number of people hanged in Iran this year, according to the AFP news agency. Many are public hangings.  Capital offences in Iran include murder, rape, armed robbery, serious drug trafficking, apostasy, adultery and homosexual acts between men."
682,"Two of the big cats lunged for the US troops who then fired at them, one soldier said.  The lions were among hundreds of animals abandoned at the zoo.  Most of the others were stolen by looters or released in the aftermath of the US takeover of the Iraqi capital.  But the thieves left seven lions and two tigers in their cages, unfed for 10 or more days.  Sergeant Matthew Oliver said three lionesses and one male lion clawed their way out of their outdoor pen through a crumbling wall.  ""Two of them charged our guys. We had to take them down,"" he said.  ""The zoo keeper came the next day and he was pretty cut up, but I think he understood.""  The US 3rd Infantry which controls Baghdad has now posted guards at the zoo to protect the big cats as well as two released bears which wandered back.  The remaining animals are now fed regularly with supplies donated by Kuwait.  A Siberian tiger owned by Saddam Hussein's son Uday appears healthier according to one report from the capital.  Uday Hussein also kept lions in his own private zoo at a presidential palace."
683,"At least 20 people have been killed and hundreds have been injured at a wedding party in Jerusalem after the dance floor collapsed. At least 20 people have been killed and hundreds have been injured at a wedding party in Jerusalem after the dance floor collapsed. Guests were left clinging to the sides of the Versailles wedding hall when the third floor suddenly gave way at about 2245 local time and crashed through two storeys below. There were nearly 700 guests in the building, which is in the industrial Talpiot area of Jerusalem. Many were left trapped by the falling rubble which left a gaping hole through the centre of the building. Reports say about 250 people have been taken to hospital but rescuers say there are signs of life beneath the debris. A special Israeli army rescue unit is at the scene. We were in the ruins. We had to be pulled out   The father of the groom, Zion Dror, said: ""We were dancing, and all of a sudden three storeys collapsed. My family is fine, thank God."" The bride, Keren Dror, who was standing with the groom in the centre of a circle of dancers fell with him when the floor collapsed. She is reported to have injuries to her head and limbs and has been taken to hospital. One wedding guest Efraim Rino told Israel Radio: ""I grabbed my son as the floor collapsed. We fell one floor, and then the next floor collapsed. And the next. And I'm trying to hold my son's hand all the time. He's ten years old. We dropped all the way down. We were in the ruins. We had to be pulled out. ""People were flying through the air, the orchestra, the loudspeakers, everything fell."" Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has already visited the scene and rejected suggestions of a terror attack. There are some reports the Versailles banquet hall was built using a cheap method of construction, known as Pal-Kal, which was outlawed five years ago. A caller to Israel's Army Radio said he had organised a wedding at the hall a week ago and had called the owners afterwards to say he was worried about the state of the dance hall floor.  The final number of dead was 23. Ten people were arrested by the Israeli authorities. They included the hall's owners, the engineer who invented the Pal-Kal method of cheap and lightweight ceiling construction and contractors and builders involved with recent renovations. An immediate safety check of all buildings using Pal-Kal was ordered. However, there were reports the checks were not thoroughly carried out and in the first six months after the disaster only one building, Lev Hagiva, was partly closed. Seven weeks after the banquet hall collapse families of the victims won their battle to have the tragedy declared a national disaster, so they could be entitled to compensation from the state. In December 2003 a report into the Versailles wedding hall disaster found it a ""miracle"" there had been no other collapses given the lack of action taken on sub-standard buildings. In October 2004 two of the owners of the hall were convicted of causing death through negligence. Two other employees were acquitted.   "
684,"Liz Lochhead has been confirmed as the new Scots Makar, or national poet.  The 63-year-old follows on from Edwin Morgan who died, aged 90, last August. He had held the post since it was created in 2004.  Ms Lochhead, originally from North Lanarkshire, is a widely recognised poet, author, translator, playwright, stage performer and broadcaster.  Her first official engagement will be to open the new Burns Museum in Alloway on Friday.  ""I am as delighted as I am surprised by this enormous honour,"" she said.  ""I accept it on behalf of poetry itself, which is, and always has been, the core of our culture, and in grateful recognition of the truth that poetry - the reading of it, the writing of it, the saying it out loud, the learning of it off by heart - all of this matters deeply to ordinary Scottish people everywhere.""  Ms Lochhead will stand down from her post as Glasgow's Makar in order to fulfil the new role.  The artist was born at Newarthill, near Motherwell, in 1947.  She studied at the Glasgow School of Art and taught art at schools in Glasgow and Bristol.  She was Writer in Residence at Edinburgh University from 1986 to 1987 and Writer in Residence at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1988.  Her first collection of poems, Memo for Spring, was published in 1972 and won a Scottish Arts Council Book Award.  The artist is a fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, the Glasgow Institute of Art, Glasgow Institute of Architects and the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.  She also holds honorary doctorates from 10 Scottish universities.  Ms Lochhead was confirmed in post by First Minister Alex Salmond and former first ministers Lord McConnell and Henry McLeish at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh.  Mr Salmond said: ""As an author, translator, playwright, stage performer, broadcaster and grande dame of Scottish theatre, Ms Lochhead embodies everything a nation would want from its national poet.  ""With a natural ability to reach all ages and touch both sexes through her writing, Ms Lochhead has also been immensely successful at championing the Scots language.  ""She continues to reach out to school pupils through her work which is widely read in Scotland's schools and she is also a much valued role model, advocate and inspiration for women who are given a strong voice in her writing.""  Ms Lochhead was selected from a shortlist recommended by a committee of representatives from Scotland's literature community.  Robyn Marsack, director of the Scottish Poetry Library, said: ""As National Poet, Liz Lochhead will be a great ambassador for the poetries of Scotland - past, present and future.  ""We are delighted to be working closely with her in her new role, furthering the Scottish Poetry Library's aim of bringing people and poems together.""  Andrew Dixon, chief executive of Creative Scotland, added: ""The appointment of Liz Lochhead as national poet sends out an important message about the role which artists play in celebrating the culture of Scotland.  ""She commands enormous respect from the literary community and is held in huge affection by the Scottish public."""
