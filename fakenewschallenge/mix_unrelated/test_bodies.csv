0,"Fifty million children are living in poverty in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, according to a new report.  The study, from the European Children's Trust, says that hunger and poverty in the countries of the former Soviet Union are now at levels approaching those in the developing world.  Within the region, the numbers of those living in poverty are more than 12 times what they were 10 years ago.  The Trust, an international development organisation, warns that with winter approaching, the situation threatens to reach crisis proportions.  The Trust says more than 168 million people were living below the bread line in 1993 to 1995, the latest available figure.  That's an increase from 14 million at the collapse of communism. The Trust believes the situation is now far worse. The proportion of the population living in poverty is as high as 88% in Kyrgyzstan and between 60 and 66% in Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Moldova. The report, called The Silent Crisis, highlights the plight of children. It warns that poverty is driving social breakdown with many families having to leave their children in state orphanages to ward off malnutrition.  The Trust says a crisis has been building since the old communist system disappeared. It claims a sudden relaxation of price controls, coupled with widespread privatisation of industry produced economic meltdown. Production fell, inflation soared and the safety nets provided by the old regime simply evaporated. The Trust suggests that rather than direct aid, the West should help the expansion of services preventing family breakdown."
1,"The Terras lost 3-2 at Rushden and Diamonds on Saturday, and lie 19th in the Blue Square Premier table, five points off the relegation zone.  Tindall became player-manager in January 2007, guiding the club to a mid-table finish last term.  However, this season the Dorset club have struggled, recording just three home wins.  In a statement the club said: ""Regretfully, following the recent run of frustrating league results, the board feels that it is paramount to act decisively in order to secure the long-term future of the club.  ""Remaining in the Blue Square Premier is of the upmost importance to the club's continued progression."""
2,"In a vanishing act echoing the film The Thomas Crown Affair, the picture was stolen from its usual position and replaced with a replica - despite a 24-hour guard in the lobby.  Staff at the men's prison discovered the theft of the picture, which depicts Christ on the cross, on Saturday morning.  The original, last valued at $175,000 back in 1985, was drawn in red and black ink for a former Corrections Department commissioner and for many years hung in the inmates' dining room.  ""It's a great mystery at this point. It looks like the painting has been replaced by a copy,"" Thomas Antenen, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, told the New York Times.  According to the New York Post, one of the prison's officers noticed that the image in the locked display case where the picture was housed ""didn't look right"".  Several more officers examined the picture and, having drawn the conclusion that something was amiss, called the police.  Investigators are baffled as to how the large painting - which measures three feet by four feet (one metre by 1.2) - could have been removed unnoticed.  In fact police are unable to even pinpoint when the painting could have been stolen and replaced by the fake, which was stapled to the back of the display case.  Nico S Yperifanos, a close friend of Dali's, who delivered the painting to Rikers Island 38 years ago, said he thought the audacious plan must have involved several people.  ""My god. It's difficult to imagine how a painting of this size would be removed from the jail. I don't know how it could have been removed intact,"" he told the New York Post.  Prisoners do not have access to the lobby, which is used only by prison personnel.  Experts have said that the painting could be worth at least three times its last estimate of $175,000.  Mr Yperifanos added that Dali, who died in 1989, would have been devastated by the theft.  Dali drew the sketch in 1965 as an apology to Anna Moscowitz Kross, the then Corrections Commissioner, after he was unable to attend a talk on art for the prisoners at Rikers because he was sick.  He dashed out the picture in just two hours and despatched Mr Yperifanos to deliver it.  On the corner he had written ""For the dinning room [sic] of the Prisoners Rikers Ysland - SD"".  And there it hung for 16 years until it was re-housed in the jail's lobby."

4,"A judge in Madrid has ordered the exhumation of the body of Spanish artist Salvador Dalí to get samples for a paternity suit.  A Spanish woman, born in 1956, said her mother, a maid, had a clandestine affair with the painter in 1955.  The judge said there were no biological remains or personal objects of the artist to be used in the test. He died in Spain in 1989 at the age of 85.  The Dalí Foundation, which manages the artist's estate, says it will appeal.  The surrealist painter was buried in the theatre and museum he designed himself, in his home town of Figueres in the north-eastern Catalonia region.  Maria Pilar Abel Martínez, a tarot card reader who was born in Girona, made the paternity claim for the first time in 2015.  She said her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in Cadaqués, next to where the painter had a home.  Antonia left her job in 1955, moved to a different city and married another man.  Ms Martínez claimed that her mother told her several times that Dalí was her father, on many occasions in front of others.  ""The only thing I'm missing is a moustache,"" she once said, according to newspaper El Mundo (in Spanish).  At the time of the alleged affair, Dalí was married to his muse Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. The couple had no children.  The decision also cites that Ms Martínez underwent two paternity tests, both in 2007, but never received the results.  Her legal action is against the Spanish state, to which Dalí left his estate.  If she is confirmed to be the artist's daughter, she could use his surname and be entitled to part of his estate - but Spanish media say she would have to legally request it.  Ms Martínez's lawyer said there was no date for the exhumation, but that it could happen as soon as July.  The Dalí Foundation said in a statement that an appeal would ""be lodged in the coming days.""  Richard III: When a skeleton was found underneath a Leicester car park in 2012, archaeologists hoped they may have found the last Plantagenet king. The next year, it was confirmed the bones did belong to Richard III, who was killed in battle in 1485. The monarch was interred in a more fitting location - that of Leicester Cathedral - in 2015.  Lech Kaczynski: It did not take long for the rumours to start after the Polish president and a number of other senior figures - including the country's army chief, central bank governor, MPs and leading historians - were killed in a plane crash in 2010. But it took another six years for their bodies to be exhumed. And when they did, what they found was nothing less than baffling. The remains had been mixed up - with Mr Kaczynski's coffin containing the bodies of two other people.  Nelson Mandela's children: As the South African president lay dying in 2013, three of the children who predeceased him were in the process of being exhumed. It was the second time the bodies had been dug up: Mr Mandela's grandson Mandla had first moved them from the family graveyard in 2011, allegedly without the family's consent.  Pablo Neruda: The Nobel prize-winning Chilean poet was exhumed in 2013, 40 years after he died of prostate cancer. It was rumoured Neruda - whose death came days after the military coup which brought General Augusto Pinochet to power - may have been poisoned. The exhumation did not find any poison, but did find an unexplained bacterial infection before he was reburied in 2016.  Lots of people in Madagascar: Some people on the African island exhume their relatives as an act of love and respect.  And finally... a goose: Police in Hertfordshire exhumed the body of a goose, investigating allegations it was shot dead at point-blank range. A post-mortem found he had died of natural causes."
5,"For years the best description of the political situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina has been ""stagnant but stable"".  Now, with astonishing speed, analysts are already talking about a ""Bosnian Spring"".  In Tuzla, Mostar, Zenica and Sarajevo, government buildings have been set on fire and there have been demonstrations across much of the rest of the country. Hundreds have been injured, including policemen.  Politicians have condemned ""hooligans"" for the violence but many are frightened.  Pictures have gone viral of cars, allegedly belonging to politicians, which have been tipped into a canal in Zenica.  The trouble began in the northern town of Tuzla on Wednesday. Workers from several factories which were privatised and which have now gone bankrupt united to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions.  The workers were joined by students and political activists. After they began stoning the local court, violence broke out.  Bosnia's four-year war ended in 1995, and since then there have been few protests over social issues.  Up to 2006, there was progress in making Bosnia something of a more functional state. But ever since, Bosnian politics have been in a state of utter stalemate and like the rest of the western Balkans, the country has been hit hard by years of economic crisis.  Unemployment is running at 27.5%, and none of the economic indicators point to anything like a serious recovery.  Old socialist-era industries, which dominated towns like Tuzla, were often left as shells after the war. Privatisations were often corrupt, with well-connected people buying companies to strip of them of their assets to make a quick profit - before declaring them bankrupt.  For years, Bosnians have fumed about their politicians - whom they almost universally believe to be corrupt.  But the war left people apathetic, frightened and cynical.  Indeed, the war years left such deep traumas that anger about the way politicians have prospered while standards of living have declined has been suppressed out of fear of a return to conflict.  Bosnia's basic political problem is that the war left its people with a dysfunctional state.  The country is divided into two main parts. Half the country is the Serbian-dominated Republika Srpska, whose leader Milorad Dodik wants it to become an independent state.  The other half is called the Federation and is comprised of ten cantons, which are either dominated by Bosniaks (who used to be called Bosnian Muslims) or Bosnian Croats. Each canton has its own government, which is then superimposed over local, city and town councils.  Finally, one town, Brcko, is an autonomous entity.  With only some 3.8m people, it is sometimes said that what Bosnia really needs is actually just a mayor, but ethnic divisions mean it has proved impossible to change the situation.  Indeed, ever since 2009 Bosnia's leaders have been preoccupied with the so-called ""Sejdic-Finci question,"" which while important in and of itself, is of no relevance to most people, who are worried about schools, jobs and health care.  Under the terms of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the war in 1995, certain key jobs, such as being a member of the country's tripartite presidency, are reserved for Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks only.  This was successfully challenged at the European Court of Human Rights by Jakob Finci and Dervo Sejdic, who are Jewish and Roma respectively.  Ever since then, European and American officials have tried everything to cajole Bosnia's leaders to adapt the constitution - but they have had no success.  However, issues such as these have sucked the air out of political debate - meaning that the economy is always neglected.  All Balkan countries, including Croatia, which joined the European Union last year, have been hit by the economic crisis and share many of the same problems.  But in Bosnia the legacies of the war mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over.  But will the protests actually change anything?  Two important points. Firstly, social protests in summer in Sarajevo fizzled out very quickly, despite much excitement.  Secondly, up to now, the protests are mostly a Bosniak affair.  While the protesters have been avowedly anti-nationalist, so far they have not spread to the Republika Srpska or to predominantly Croat areas, even though economically everyone in Bosnia faces exactly the same problems.  This year three big events are on the Bosnian calendar. It will hold elections, its mostly (but not entirely) Bosniak-supported football team will play in the World Cup, and Sarajevo will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the event that changed the world - the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914 which sparked the First World War.  It is still far too early to say whether 2014 will one day be remembered as the year that changed Bosnia. But today hope is running high.  ""My impression is that there is no going back now,"" says Dusica Ikic-Cook, a business administrator in Tuzla.  ""I believe we will get results, even if only in the Federation to kill this huge administration which is sucking up all our money."""
6,"Five teenagers in the Dominican Republic have been jailed for three to five years for murdering seven taxi drivers and injuring two more.  The youngsters, who are 15 to 17 years old, carried out a string of taxi robberies in April, police said.  During the assaults, they shot two of the drivers and killed five others by forcing them to drink drain cleaner.  They also doused the bodies with drain cleaner to prevent them from being identified, police said.  The victims' relatives had demanded that the teenagers, three boys and two girls, be treated as adults and serve up to 30 years in prison, the maximum penalty for murder in the Dominican Republic.  The sentencing came a day after the government of the Caribbean nation banned the sale of several drain cleaners because they have increasingly been used in violent assaults.  In August an eight-month-old baby and its mother died after the woman's partner doused both with drain cleaner, police said."
7,"President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal of the breakaway region of Somaliland, has commented for the first time on the results of last week's independence referendum in which voters backed cessation from Somalia.  President Egal said Somaliland was no longer just a collection of clans but a nation in its own right.  He said the results of the referendum also brought to an end the question of whether Somaliland should ever reunite with Somalia.  The president said his message to the international community was that Somaliland is worth doing business with.

8,"A carer who looked after the composer of the music for the Bridge On the River Kwai has won a High Court battle over his final work.  Anthony Day cared for Northampton-born composer Sir Malcolm Arnold for 22 years until his 2006 death.  A letter granted him the manuscript for his 9th symphony saying it would not have been produced but for his care.  The family challenged this, but Judge Charles Purle QC disagreed and awarded the score to Mr Day on Wednesday.  Mr Day, 60 - who never took a day off work - was also granted 22 years' holiday pay amounting to £62,500.  The composer's family, represented by daughter Katherine, 60, and son Robert, 57, must pay Mr Day's court costs of £140,000.  The case revolved around what should be included in the composer's will as some manuscripts from the 1960s and 70s had already been given to his daughter Katherine.  The judge decided that the composer had never made a gift of the bulk of his manuscripts to his children and he recognised the wish to make a gift of the last scores to Mr Day.  The case was further complicated by Mr Day's appointment as an executor of the composer's will, so the judge granted a further appeal.  The family are now to decide whether to take their challenge to the Court of Appeal.  Sir Malcolm, who died aged 84, composed hundreds of scores including the music for films such as the Battle of Britain and David Copperfield.  He also composed works for the stage including the musical Sweeney Todd and dozens of orchestra and choral works.  Sir Malcolm was an alcoholic living in a pub in Northamptonshire in 1984 when Mr Day ""saved him from oblivion"", the court had heard earlier.  The composer's children argued that he was subjected to ""undue influence"" over his will and claimed Sir Malcolm's collection, now held at the Royal College of Music, was given to them.  The composer had been made a ward of the Court of Protection when Mr Day stepped in, the court was told.  He was the neighbour of a distant relative and went on to live with and care for Sir Malcolm in Attleborough, Norfolk, where the composer said he regained his creative spark.  Sir Malcolm left much of his fortune to him when he died, including his home and a half-share of the royalties from his work.  The remaining estate was split equally between Robert and Katherine Arnold, the court heard."
9,"There's an often-quoted statistic that right-handed people live on average nine years longer than left-handed people. As the daughter of two left-handed parents, and the sister of a left-handed brother, this, to me, is a rather worrying idea. But is there any truth in it?  The finding was advanced in two articles in the late 1980s and early 1990s by American psychologists Diane Halpern and Stanley Coren - both published in prestigious scientific journals, Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine.  But what could the explanation for the premature death of left-handers possibly be?  Something to do with the fact that tools are not designed for them?  ""Knives are very awkward,"" says Claire Allen from Hampshire in southern England.  ""They are designed for right-handers - if you use it as a left-hander it cuts on the slant all the time, whereas for a right-hander it cuts straight.""  I know that my mother would be bereft without her special left-handed sewing scissors.  But surely nothing like this could be responsible for cutting life short by almost a decade?  ""It's not at all plausible,"" says Chris McManus, professor of psychology and medical education at University College London and the author of Right Hand, Left Hand.  ""If this were true it would be the largest single predictor we had of life expectancy - it would be like smoking 120 cigarettes a day plus doing a number of other dangerous things simultaneously. It really is highly implausible that an epidemiologist wouldn't have spotted it previously.""  If it's so implausible why was it published in respected academic journals and why has the myth endured?  Because, according Chris McManus, the researchers made a ""very subtle error"".  The studies were conducted in Southern California, where lists are published of everyone who has died.  Halpern and Coren took a list of the people who had recently died and contacted their families, asking whether or not their relative had been right- or left-handed.  Looking at 2,000 cases, they saw that the average age at death of the left-handers was about nine years younger than of the right-handers. On that basis, they concluded that left-handers died earlier.  At first glance, that seems persuasive. What did the researchers do wrong?  ""Their mistake was that they only looked at the dead,"" Chris McManus explains.  The point is that left-handers are more common now than they used to be, so - at least at the time the research was published - left-handers were on average younger than right-handers.  ""The natural rate of left-handedness is around 10% or 11%, but the rate was pushed down artificially during the Victorian period,"" says Chris McManus.  ""You can see it going down from about 1800 onwards through to about 1900.""  Not only would left-handed people have been encouraged not to be during this period, life was also pretty difficult for them and they quickly became very conspicuous.  ""They went to work in factories using machines designed for right-handers - and the left-handers looked awkward,"" says McManus.  ""And then compulsory schooling came along and they were obliged to sit in classrooms and try and write with their right hand using an ink pen and they made a mess. The result of all of this was that left-handers became stigmatised - regarded as cack-handed, stupid.""  So, some of the people who had died on those Californian lists may well have been born left-handed, but spent most of their lives acting and identifying as right-handers. Their families would have described them as such, when the researchers came knocking.  This would have skewed their results.  To see why, imagine an exaggerated scenario where there were no left handers at all born before 1973 - 40 years ago.  If we now look at death records for 2013 and ask who, among the dead, was left-handed we would see that all of them died at or before the age of 40. That would be much younger than the average of age at death of right-handers.  Nothing like this exaggerated scenario ever occurred in reality - but the number of people identifying as left-handed did grow dramatically during the 20th Century.  So the idea that left-handers die nine years earlier than right-handers is a myth.  What about non-fatal injuries? Should we be worried about people like Claire Allen struggling in the kitchen with knives designed for the right-handed? Or my own mother for that matter, if she were forced to use right-handed scissors?  ""There is some evidence that left-handers are more likely to have minor accidents,"" says Chris McManus.  ""But it's pretty insubstantial and I doubt if it's affecting the mortality rate very much at all.""  You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"
10,"The music business is joining with the Internet industry in campaigning against a European copyright directive which both say is flawed.  The Internet industry came off worst with clause 5.1, effectively banning caching - the temporary storage of data on servers which helps to speed up the Net.  Strasbourg going 'too far'  British Music Rights, which has been leading the campaign in the UK for copyright protection on the Internet for musicians, composers and their publishers, says Strasbourg has gone too far in banning caching.  ""In our view, caching should be seen as merely as part of a process, ie as a means to an end,"" it said.  ""Therefore, it is the licensing of the process that is the issue, not caching itself. If the process from A to B is properly licensed, there is no debate to be had about whether caching infringes copyright.""  BMR is supporting a Ban the Ban campaign launched last week by the Silicon.com IT news Website, with the backing of the music and IT industries and politicians.  Ban the Ban had targeted the European Commissioner responsible for copyright, Mario Monti, for a lobbying campaign.  But it was dealt a blow with his resignation this week along with other commissioners, as a result of a report saying they had lost control of the activities of their staff.  The parliament's draft copyright directive bans the caching of copyrighted materials, where royalties have not been paid.  Mr Monti was expected to submit his redraft to thee EU Council of Ministers in June, but this now seems unlikely.  Other industry leaders feel a ban on caching will never be imposed. Martin Alsen, marketing vice president at Mirror Image, says he is pretty confident that a ""totally clueless"" decision will be overturned.  ""It will not be ratified by the national parliaments, I am pretty sure of that,"" he said.  ""The issue here is whether you want the Internet to work or not, and protect copyright holders' rights, or want to take it further and make problems for them in distributing their content.""  Mirror Image provides central caching services that accelerate access to information over the Net from twice to ten-times normal speeds. It currently has central caching in Frankfurt, London, Washington and St Louis and plans another 30 centres worldwide in the next 18 months."
11,"A booklet produced in 1987 told Soviet soldiers how to behave in Afghanistan. The last Soviet soldier left Afghan territory on 15 February 1989. ""The Internationalist soldier must always hold high the honour of the Soviet citizen."" ""The Internationalist soldier is forbidden to enter into unsanctioned relationships!"" In fact, while soldiers admitted that it was easy to fall into a trap, few avoided social contact with locals. Soldiers ""must never visit"" local shops or stalls. According to accounts, anything from Japanese watches to machine guns were on sale, and while alcohol was rare, hashish was easy to buy. ""The Internationalist soldier should not undress, sunbathe or swim in the presence of local people... because such behaviour... is considered offensive."" Soldiers were forbidden from looking at the faces of women or from starting conversations with them. The pamphlet said soldiers must not take gifts and bribes from local leaders. Soldiers said sometimes it was difficult to refuse them. Soldiers must ""observe a regime of secrecy"" and be careful who was listening, the pamphlet said. Many Afghans spoke good Russian, although they often tried not to show it.     "
12,"Two decades of war have laid waste Afghanistan's environment so badly that its reconstruction is now compromised, the United Nations says.  A UN Environment Programme (Unep) survey found more than half of Kabul's water supply is going to waste.  It found children working 12-hour shifts in dangerous factories, and sleeping at their machines.  More than half the forests in three Afghan provinces have been destroyed in 25 years.  A team from Unep's Post-Conflict Assessment Unit worked with the Afghanistan Transitional Authority to carry out the survey.  It involved 20 Afghan and foreign scientists in visits to 38 urban sites in four cities, and to 35 rural sites.  The team's report says the years of conflict have led to the ""collapse of local and national governance, destroyed infrastructure, hindered agricultural activity and driven people into cities already lacking the most basic public amenities"".  It says: ""Three to four years of drought have compounded a state of widespread and serious resource degradation: lowered water tables, dried-up wetlands, denuded forests, eroded land and depleted wildlife populations.""  Two million refugees returned to Afghanistan last year, and 1.5m more are expected in 2003, putting further strains on the country and its natural resources.  Dr Klaus Toepfer, Unep's executive director, said the report showed environmental restoration must be a major part of Afghanistan's reconstruction.  He said: ""Over 80% of Afghan people live in rural areas, yet they have seen many of their basic resources - water for irrigation, trees for food and fuel - lost in just a generation. In urban areas the most basic necessity for human wellbeing - safe water - may be reaching as few as 12% of the people.""  The report says Kabul's water system is losing up to 60% of its supply because of leaks and illegal use.  In Herat, only 10% of the 150 public taps were working. There, and in Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar and the capital, the team found medical waste from hospitals being disposed of in the streets and an abandoned well.  In some cases it contained syringes and human organs. Urban drinking water had high concentrations of bacteria contaminants, coliforms and E.coli from sewage.  Solid waste disposal, Unep says, is ""one of the country's most glaring problems"". Dumps are often sited above cities, where heavy rain can wash the waste back into the streets.  The report says: ""Unep investigations of oil refineries and transport terminals, and brick, asphalt and lead battery factories revealed acute environmental and human health risks.  ""In a plastic recycling/shoe factory in Kabul the team found children working without protection from toxic chemicals and sleeping at machines, or in factory alcoves, between their 12-hour shifts.""  In the countryside, it says, satellite imagery shows conifer forests in the provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar and Nuristan have shrunk by more than half since 1978.  Pistachio woodlands in northern Afghanistan, valuable money earners, have been devastated. The report says: ""Almost no trees could be detected in Badghis and Takhar provinces in 2002 by satellite instruments, compared with 55% and 37% land cover respectively in 1977.""  Inevitably, wildlife suffers: several hundred families had taken over an island in the Amu Darya river which was formerly home to otters, wild boar, Bactrian deer and birds of prey.  The team also spent two weeks on horseback in a remote area grazed by Kyrgyz and Wakhi herders, where there are snow leopards, Marco Polo sheep, wolves, brown bears and Asian ibex.  Unep says hunting, mainly for meat and furs, was significantly reduced during the Soviet occupation, but has increased since then."
13,"The incident occured before the team's Under-21 European Championships qualifier against Turkey and Pennant was sent back to club side Arsenal by coach David Platt.  The incident led to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger warning Pennant that he would have no future with the Gunners if he did not improve his discipline.  ""I have apologised to the three main people who look after my football, who are David Platt, (England Under-21 coach) David Dein (Arsenal vice-chairman) and my boss Mr Arsene Wenger.  ""I have called them to apologise and I said sorry and it won't happen again.  ""You do learn from your mistakes and now I'm going to put my head down and work hard in training and get my attitude right and get back into the squad.""  Pennant was signed four years ago as the most expensive teenager in Britain in a £2m deal from Notts County.  And after his return to Highbury, Wenger said: ""I hope he'll learn from this as you can understand that young boys make mistakes. But if they don't learn, there's no future for them.  ""Some players who appeared for England against Turkey have made mistakes in the past but they have learned from them. His future is down to him now.  ""The biggest part of success until 20 is how much talent you have and, after 20, it's how much you want it.""  Wenger could turn to former skipper Tony Adams, who overcame alcohol problems during his successful spell at Highbury, to help guide Pennant in the right direction.  ""We will help him to control his life better and someone like Tony Adams could be a big help in that,"" he revealed."
14,"Crouch turned in Alvaro Arbeloa's cross to put Liverpool ahead after four minutes, then headed in from Fabio Aurelio's delivery in the 34th minute.  Daniel Agger glanced in another brilliant Aurelio cross on the hour before William Gallas poked in from almost on the line for Arsenal.  Crouch then made it a treble with a neat turn and finish after 80 minutes.  Liverpool recalled Crouch, who missed England's two Euro 2008 matches to have an operation on a broken nose.  And the giant striker was the central figure in a first 45 minutes that saw Liverpool cruise into the lead.  He provided the perfect finish to a delightful Liverpool build-up in the fourth minute, sweeping in at the near post after Jermaine Pennant's neat flick set up Arbeloa for the cross.  Arsenal looked lethargic, but threatened briefly when Emmanuel Adebayor headed just over.  But Crouch was in rampant mood, ignoring the better-placed Steven Gerrard to fire an ambitious shot across the face of goal after 26 minutes.  The unpredictable Julio Baptista should have drawn Arsenal level five minutes later when he was played in by Adebayor, but the man who scored four at Anfield in a Carling Cup tie earlier this season side-footed tamely wide.  And it proved an expensive miss as Liverpool doubled their advantage 11 minutes before half-time.  Xabi Alonso's quick free-kick found Aurelio, and Crouch soared to meet his perfect cross to send a brilliant header high past the diving Jens Lehmann.  Arsenal's luck was out again after 53 minutes when Adebayor's low left-foot shot rebounded to safety off the post.  There was some concern for Liverpool when captain Gerrard went off two minutes later.  He needed to have an ice-pack applied to a thigh injury - with boss Rafa Benitez hoping he will recover in time for Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against PSV Eindhoven.  But the smiles were back on Liverpool faces just on the hour when a superbly delivered free-kick from Aurelio was glanced past Lehmann by Agger.  Adebayor was still battling away, but he was cursing again after 63 minutes when his header was turned on to an upright by Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina.  Arsenal pulled a goal back with 18 minutes left, Gallas turning home from almost on the line after Kolo Toure touched on substitute Tomas Rosicky's corner.  But any hopes of an unlikely Arsenal comeback were snuffed out after 80 minutes when Crouch turned Toure expertly before firing past Lehmann.  ""The manager let us know beforehand we've had some disappointing results against Arsenal this season.  ""You don't care how they come but it was a nice hat-trick, I'm pleased with it. It is a special moment.""  ""There is not a big enough gap even if maybe my players felt they had done enough.  ""That is not the case. We will have to give our best in every game now, we must win all our home matches and pick up some away wins too.  ""My players are now concerned. They did not produce what was expected."""
15,"Footballer Jermaine Pennant has avoided a jail sentence after admitting driving home from a nightclub while drunk.  The Stoke City star admitted being over twice the legal limit, driving while disqualified and without insurance in Greater Manchester on 29 April.  The winger was arrested after crashing his BMW in Cross Street, Sale, Trafford Magistrates' Court heard.  Pennant was banned from driving for three years and given an eight-week jail sentence, suspended for a year.  The former Liverpool, Birmingham City and Arsenal player was also fined £80 costs and given a 12-month supervision order.  On passing sentence, District Judge Khalid Qureshi said the jail term had been suspended due to the previous offences taking place a ""considerable time"" ago.  The court heard he had already been banned from driving earlier that month by magistrates in Cannock, Staffordshire, but he claimed he was not aware of the ban as a letter had not reached him.  The 29 year old, of Pool Lane, Sandbach, Cheshire, was ""depressed and stressed"" after months of turmoil in his private life and suffering taunts while in the nightclub.  Pennant had been playing football earlier that day and had arranged for his estranged partner and their 20-month-old child to come to see him perform but they did not turn up.  When he got home, he found his new girlfriend had taken all her belongings and he received a text message telling him their relationship was over.  He then decided to go out to a nightclub in Manchester with friends but while there he became ""distressed"" because of comments circulating about his former partner, his lawyer said.  He said this ""broke the camel's back"" and Pennant, unable to book a hotel room in central Manchester, decided to drive home.  It was then that he crashed at about 05:30 BST.  The court heard the defendant may have been speeding and gone through a red light, but he was not prosecuted over the minor crash.  When breathalysed he gave a reading of 89mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mcg.  The judge said: ""I accept this had not been a pre-planned decision to drive.  ""The circumstances which arose you found difficult to deal with and led you to believe the only option you had was to drive your vehicle, to get away from an unpleasant situation, you had no option."""
16,"When the Number 40 bus arrived, the most curious thing happened. Husbands left heavily pregnant wives or spouses struggling with prams and pushchairs to fend for themselves as they and all other male passengers got on at the front of the bus.  Women moved towards the rear door to get on at the back.  When on the bus, I tried to buck the system, moving my way towards the driver but was pushed back towards the other women.  These are what orthodox Jews call ""modesty buses"".  The separation system operates on 30 public bus routes across Israel.  The authorities here say the arrangement is voluntary, but in practice, as I found out, there is not much choice involved.  Naomi Ragen is one of a group of women now taking the separation bus system to court. She is an orthodox Jew herself.  ""I wasn't trying to start a revolution, all I wanted to do was get home,"" she tells me.  ""I was in downtown Jerusalem and I saw a bus going straight to my neighbourhood and I got on and sat down, in a single seat behind the driver.  ""It was a completely empty bus, and all of a sudden, some men started getting on, ultra-orthodox men. They told me I was not allowed to sit there, I had to go to the back of the bus.""  Not only is the segregation system discriminatory, says Ms Ragen, but it can also be dangerous, she says, for those like her who ignore it.  ""I said to him look, if you bring me a code of Jewish law and show me where it's written that I have to sit at the back of the bus I'll move.  ""And he tried to gain support from the rest of the passengers and I underwent a half-hour of pure hell - abuse, humiliation, threats, even physical intimidation.""  Supporters of the separation system say the buses involved serve mainly religious Jewish neighbourhoods - but not exclusively.  One man told me that if some people wanted segregation buses they should pay a private company to provide them.  Another told me that in a society that is democratic and where the buses are subsidised by the government, a minority's concerns should not override those of the majority.  But Shlomo Rosenstein disagrees. He is a city councillor in Jerusalem where a large proportion of Israel's segregation lines operate.  ""This really is about positive discrimination, in women's favour. Our religion says there should be no public contact between men and women, this modesty barrier must not be broken.""  Opponents of the separation buses face an uphill struggle. Orthodox Jewish leaders are a powerful minority in Israel.  Naomi Ragen says the buses are just part of a wider menacing pattern of behaviour towards women in parts of the orthodox Jewish community.  ""They've already cancelled higher education in the ultra-orthodox world for women. They have packed the religious courts with ultra-orthodox judges.  ""In some places there are separate sides of the street women have to walk on.""  She says that there are signs all over some religious neighbourhoods demanding that women dress modestly.  ""They throw paint and bleach at women who aren't dressed modestly and if we don't draw a line in the sand here with this seat on a bus, then I don't know what this country and this religion is going to look like in 20 years,"" Ms Ragen said.  Petitioners like Naomi Ragen have asked Israel's High Court to either ban the segregation buses altogether or to force bus companies to provide parallel bus routes for passengers wanting to sit where they like.  We invited readers to send in their comments. Here is a selection:  As an American who has chosen to live in Israel, and who travels the buses all the time, I am happy to say that I am quite comfortable on any bus that I ride. The ""modesty buses"" travel through the most religious neighborhoods here in Jerusalem, and by far the majority of those routes appreciate the effort. I have found that I am always treated politely.  Mrs. Ragen has written numerous books that depict orthodox Judaism as fanatical and demeaning to women. Just because she is outspoken doesn't mean she is correct or that the overwhelming majority of women feel like she does.   Shira W., Jerusalem, Israel  I'm a secular student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I didn't take a ride on one of these buses. However, one time I got lost in one of those religious streets. It was a cold day and I was covered with layers of clothes, but that didn't seem to be enough. Every religious man who walked down the street there had to tell me something between his teeth. I didn't understand it because it was in Yiddish. I started to run because I was so scared...  Einav Bury, Jerusalem, Israel  Just a few weeks ago I got on a bus to Jerusalem. The front was all men, but I just kept walking to the back. I then realized that it was all women, but I kept walking. Quickly I realized that it must have been a religious group that don't sit together. Oops. But I sat in the back of the bus the whole time in my shorts, tshirt and sandals. I got looks from the women the entire time, but oh well. Fighting the system...  Dovid Glottier, Moshav Shdema, Israel  I ride these ""modesty"" buses on a daily basis. I think the above article is lacking in a lot of information. The main reason for the segregation came as a public backlash to overcrowded buses particularly in religious neighbourhoods. Things came to a head when, in August 2002 a suicide bomber killed 23 passengers on a bus #2 in the Religious Beis Yisrael neighbourhood. The higher than usual fatalities was a result of overcrowding. Overcrowding in this part of society means that people who lead a spiritually holy life are shoved against the hum and scrum of society. Bear in mind, the National bus company Egged will tell you that Modesty buses are the most successful lines in the country, such as #402 #450 #451 #350 #418.   Aryeh, Jerusalem  I absolutely agree with Ms. Ragen (a wonderful author). The forceful behavior of orthodox Jews in some parts of Israel towards women (non religious as well as religious and even tourists) is appalling. This minority group is usually backed by the government because of political allies and it has gained power in recent years. No intervention is in sight and the only thing to do is try to hold ground, petition and keep the status quo (segregation buses break it for the worse). Israel is mostly secular and democratic and we should strive to keep it that way.  Lior Haner, Ramat Gan, Israel  I live in Israel. I am a Hassidic man, but with a very secular outlook as far as politics are concerned. I detest the religious involvement in purely political issues such as The Law of Return and even those that purport to uphold Jewish Law and modesty, for I am a firm believer in the unalienable right of the individual to decide. However, what is not stressed in your article is that those buses run IN ADDITION to other, non-segregated buses on the same routes. The incidents in your articles are of people who happened to miss the so called secular buses, or chose those buses for other reasons.   Yoel, Jerusalem, Israel"
17,"At least 27 people have died after a fire at King's Cross station in central London.  The blaze reportedly began at about 1930 GMT in a machine room under a wooden escalator.  The escalator connected the Piccadilly line - one of five underground train routes which run through King's Cross - with the mainline station.  The fire started as the evening rush hour was trailing off but hundreds of commuters were still in the station which is London's busiest.  Many passengers were trapped underground as the escalator went up in flames.  More than 150 firefighters wearing breathing apparatus tackled the blaze and searched for survivors.  But they were not able to bring the main fire under control until approximately 2150 GMT.  It is feared the death toll could reach 40 after a search of the station has been completed.  A fire brigade spokesman, Brian Clark, said the scene in the concourse at the top of the burnt escalator was one of total devastation.  Mr Clark said tiles had come off walls and concrete was damaged because of the intense heat.  ""The situation there must have been very frightening and that is an understatement,"" he added.  About 20 people, including four members of the emergency services, have been taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation and burns.  The chairman of London Regional Transport (LRT), Sir Keith Bright, has described the blaze as a ""major disaster"".  Sir Keith said LRT was already implementing a policy to replace old wooden escalators with non-flammable metal ones.  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was ""horrified"" to hear of the ""dreadful"" fire and sent her deepest sympathies to the families of those who have been killed and injured.  The Railway Inspectorate has started an investigation into the blaze and will advise Transport Secretary Paul Channon about ordering an inquiry."
18,"The star of the Jonathan Creek television series - Alan Davies - has admitted being bullied at school made him depressed and even prompted him to shoplift. Supporting the launch of the Department for Education's new bullying guidelines for schools, Davies recalled his experiences of being bullied at the independent Bancroft School in Woodford Green, Essex.    I got quite depressed and became a proficient shoplifter    ""I suffered at the hands of some older boys for a few weeks. They thought it would be fun to trip you up, yank your tie, call you names,"" he said. ""I got quite depressed and became a proficient shoplifter, which filled the time. ""I made quite a good living - I would pinch things then flog them to the other kids,"" he joked. Davies said he was unhappy throughout secondary school years and his education had suffered as a result. ""It wasn't until I went to a further education college that I got back on track,"" the actor said. ""I do know what it's like to be very unhappy as a child because of bullying and there is no framework to deal with it - you don't tell anyone, that's the whole point."" Pupils at his school were considered ""posh"" by other schoolchildren in the area, he added, which led to bullying outside of school. Speaking in a DfEE video - which forms part of the Don't suffer in silence campaign - Davies tells how losing his mother at the age of six made him feel different to his friends. ""There was an atmosphere of relentless mickey-taking - just non-stop. ""You were almost afraid to move sometimes and someone would say some deeply sarcastic comments at your expense."" Bullies are people who feel powerless themselves and who want to have some effect on the world, he reminds pupils. ""If they can have influence over some kid's behaviour everyday, it gives them a sense of power."" Also featured in the anti-bullying video is Blackadder's Baldrick - Tony Robinson. Robinson believes he was targeted by bullies because he was smaller and ""weedier"" than the other children and was also short-sighted. ""Not only was I specky-four eyes, I had those teeth which stick out as well."" The video is fronted by Patsy Palmer, who played Bianca in the BBC soap, Eastenders. ""It's really hurtful and it makes the people being bullied feel miserable and alone - especially if they suffer in silence. ""I should know because I was bullied at school myself."" She urges pupils not to put up with bullying and to speak out against it. The revised education pack for schools was launched on Wednesday at a conference organised by Family Service Units. The Education Secretary, David Blunkett said: ""The message needs to go loud and clear to the bullies: bullying is unacceptable, it won't earn you respect. ""For those who are bullied and their friends the message is simple - tell someone, don't suffer in silence."" BBC News Online is hosting a forum with strongman ""Big Dave"" Gauder, who was bullied when younger and who now tours schools talking to children about the problem. He will be answering your questions on Thursday."

20,"Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been released from house arrest and had his $6m (£3.7m) cash bail and bond returned amid doubts over the credibility of his accuser.  Prosecutors have agreed that Mr Strauss-Kahn should be freed ""on his own recognisance"", meaning he must simply promise to appear in court.  He is accused of sexually assaulting a maid in a New York hotel on 14 May.  The case is now close to collapse, US media reports say.  The 62-year-old French politician - who had been seen as a leading candidate for the French presidency - appeared in court in New York on Friday over the sexual assault case.  After assessing disclosures by prosecutors from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, a judge rescinded the strict bail terms imposed on Mr Strauss-Kahn, but did order that his passport be retained so he could not travel outside the US.  Dominique Strauss-Kahn looked tanned and confident in court in Manhattan. It was a very different sight to the dishevelled former IMF boss who appeared only a few weeks ago to deny serious sexual allegations. In the court, journalists packed the benches and even the jury box as the case took a stunning twist. Following the hearing, lawyers for both sides slugged it out under the blazing sunshine on the steps of the courthouse. Camera crews lined both sides of the street as helicopters buzzed overhead vying for a glimpse of Mr Strauss-Kahn and his wife. The street where he has remained under house arrest has been besieged by paparrazzi during the past several weeks, much to the annoyance of other residents. In New York, there has been a fascination with the seeming downfall of this powerful Frenchman. Now the story from the victim is being challenged -another amazing twist that will be followed with interest.  In a letter submitted to the court prosecutors said that the maid gave false testimony to a grand jury, omitting the fact that she cleaned another room before alerting a supervisor to her claims of sexual assault.  ""I understand that the circumstances of this case have changed substantially, and I agree the risk that he would not be here has receded quite a bit. I release Mr Strauss-Kahn at his own recognisance,"" Justice Michael Obus told the court on Friday.  ""In the meantime there will be no rush to judgment on this case,"" Mr Obus said.  On the court steps, opposing lawyers each maintained their case.  ""I want to remind all of you that at each appearance in the last six weeks, we asked you and asked the world not to rush to judgement - now I think you can understand why,"" said Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor.  ""We believe the next step will lead to the complete dismissal of the charges,"" he added.  After Friday's hearing, Mr Strauss-Kahn strode out of court smiling, with his wife on his arm.  In earlier court hearings, prosecutors had spoken of the strength of their case. One attorney said the proof against him was ""substantial"".  Now prosecutors believe she may have lied under questioning and could have links to drug dealers and money-laundering.  But the alleged victim's lawyer, Kenneth P Thompson, maintained on Friday that his client's story was genuine and that Mr Strauss-Kahn was guilty of sexual assault charges.  ""The only defence Dominique Strauss-Kahn has is that this sexual encounter was consensual. That is a lie,"" he said.  He continued at length, giving a detailed and graphic account of the maid's alleged encounter with Mr Strauss-Kahn and criticising District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.  Mr Vance said the case would continue to be investigated, including concerns that had been raised about the credibility of Mr Strauss-Kahn's accuser.  ""Our prosecutors from the Manhattan DA's office will continue their investigation into these alleged crimes and will do so until we have uncovered all relevant facts,"" he said.  Mr Strauss-Kahn is to appear back in court on 18 July.  The maid claims that Mr Strauss-Kahn chased her down a hallway in his expensive hotel suite in the Sofitel hotel before sexually assaulting her.  However, unnamed law enforcement officials have now told US media the accuser has repeatedly lied since the alleged attack on 14 May.  The officials believe the woman also lied on her application for asylum in the US, particularly over an allegation that she had been raped while at home in Guinea, in West Africa.  ""She actually recounted the entire story to prosecutors and later said it was false,"" one law enforcement official told the Associated Press news agency.  But Mr Thompson defended his client's story on Friday, offering up graphic details of the alleged encounter between Mr Strauss-Kahn and the maid.  ""From day one she has described a violent sexual assault that Dominique Strauss-Kahn committed against her,"" Mr Thompson said, adding that Mr Strauss-Kahn bruised the maid's body and threw her to the floor.  ""She has never once changed a single thing about that account. The district attorney knows that,"" he added.  Mr Thompson said that though the maid ""may have made some mistakes"", that does not mean the assault never occurred.  Following the twists to the sexual assault case on Friday, hopes among some have been raised about the possibility Mr Strauss-Kahn may once again be able to compete with Nicolas Sarkozy for the French presidency in 2012.  The Socialist former Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, said: ""It's a thunderbolt - but in the opposite direction this time.""  But it was too soon to say whether Mr Strauss-Kahn might stand, he added.  ""If we hypothesise that Dominique is cleared of all suspicion and all charges, which I obviously hope will happen, then it will be first down to him to decide... and then it will be down to the Socialists to decide.""  ""It's too early to transform into politics what is so far a human drama which is developing before our eyes.""  Mr Strauss-Kahn had been under house arrest in a New York apartment since posting a $6m (£3.7m) cash bail and bond in May.  He is charged with seven counts including four more serious felony charges - two of criminal sexual acts, one of attempted rape and one of sexual abuse - plus three misdemeanour offences, including unlawful imprisonment.  Mr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund to defend himself, vigorously denies the charges."
21,"The choice was made by Uefa's eight-man technical study group, plus one vote from the organisers' official website.  The 32-year-old won his 95th cap - a joint national record - as the Greeks beat hosts Portugal 1-0 in Lisbon on Sunday to win the tournament.  Zagorakis produced a series of impressive displays during the competition as part of a three-man midfield that shielded the back four.  The former Leicester City midfielder will be presented with his award at a gala in Monaco on 26 August.  Uefa has also announced their 23-man squad for the tournament, with England stars Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney featuring.  ""The idea is to recognise the top performers that have graced the event,"" said Uefa technical director Andy Roxburgh.  ""It's been a difficult choice, but we finally came to a collective decision. The team is based on the tournament and not on reputation.""  Goalkeepers: Petr Cech (Czech Republic), Antonios Nikopolidis (Greece).    Defenders: Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole (both England), Traianos Dellas, Georgios Seitaridis (both Greece), Olof Mellberg (Sweden), Ricardo Carvalho (Portugal), Gianluca Zambrotta (Italy).    Midfielders: Michael Ballack (Germany), Luis Figo, Maniche (both Portugal), Frank Lampard (England), Pavel Nedved (Czech Republic), Theo Zagorakis (Greece), Zinedine Zidane (France).

22,"Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech has returned to full training earlier than expected following a knee injury.  It was originally feared the 29-year-old Czech international would be out for up to four weeks after he damaged knee ligaments in training last month.  However, Cech, who joined Chelsea from Rennes in 2004, has recovered quickly and could now feature in Saturday's Premier League trip to Sunderland.  Deputy Hilario has failed to keep a clean sheet in Cech's absence."
23,"Chelsea cemented their position at the top of the Premier League with victory over Arsenal as Arsene Wenger's winless streak against Jose Mourinho was extended to 12 games.  The old adversaries squared up in an ugly first-half moment when Wenger shoved Mourinho in the chest in Chelsea's technical area after Gary Cahill's challenge on Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez.  A semblance of order was restored although the tension still resurfaced - but as so often, it was Mourinho who had the last word with a win that puts the Blues five points ahead of second-placed Manchester City.  Eden Hazard's first-half penalty put them on their way after he was fouled by Laurent Koscielny, while Diego Costa's ninth goal in seven games since his £32m summer move from Atletico Madrid wrapped up the win.  This never threatened to be a repeat of Chelsea's 6-0 thrashing of Arsenal in March that marred Wenger's 1,000th match in charge of the Gunners, but there was rarely a moment when his side threatened to end his dismal sequence against Mourinho as they suffered their first league loss of the season.  The home side may not have produced the flamboyant football that has featured in some of their play this season, but the old steel at the back is still in evidence and, in Costa and former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, they have acquired a potent partnership.  Costa's goalscoring has caught the eye but the wonderful raking pass from Fabregas that set up the second goal silenced the taunts aimed from the visiting fans and was his seventh Premier League assist of the season.  It was the crowning moment of a Chelsea performance that was ruthlessly efficient and sounded an ominous note to those hoping to stop Mourinho reclaiming the Premier League title this season.  Chelsea even survived the early loss of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was taken off before half-time and replaced by Petr Cech after taking a bang on the head in a collision with Sanchez, with the Belgian taken to hospital as a precaution.  Courtois's problems started when he raced out to beat Sanchez to a through ball and there was an accidental clash between the pair - the young goalkeeper recovered after being flat out but was unable to complete the half, the Chelsea medical team eventually signalling to Mourinho that he need to be replaced.  If the action on the pitch took time to get going, there was no time-wasting between Mourinho and Wenger as their obvious personal animosity quickly boiled over.  Wenger took exception to Mourinho giving his view on Cahill's tackle on Sanchez, marching menacingly into the Chelsea technical area before giving his counterpart a very clear two-handed shove in the chest.  Mourinho, not surprisingly, was unimpressed and it took the intervention of fourth official Jon Moss to at least restore a small measure of calm between the pair.  Arsenal had acquitted themselves well without putting Chelsea under serious pressure, but were unlocked by the pace and trickery of Hazard to go behind after 27 minutes. Koscielny had no other answer to the Belgian's run into the area than to stick his leg out and bring him down, with Hazard recovering his poise to score from the spot.  Chelsea, while not being at their best, had restricted Arsenal to the extent that the visiting attacking threat was non-existent, but the Gunners had a genuine grievance when Fabregas stopped Jack Wilshere's shot from the edge of the area with raised arms just after the hour, only for referee Martin Atkinson to remain unmoved.  And while Chelsea were resolute in defence, there remained the ever-present threat of Costa. He had barely been in the game but pounced to put the match out of Arsenal's reach with 12 minutes left.  Fabregas, as he has been so often this season since joining Chelsea from Barcelona in the summer, was the creator, as a long pass sent Costa beyond Arsenal's defence to lift a finish over Wojciech Szczesny.  ""The start of the season is good, but it's just seven matches and beginning of October.  ""'I'm even more pleased to win because we played against a good Arsenal. They played a good game and gave us a difficult game.  ""We were able to deal with it without problems, which is fantastic. When we were 1-0 up the game was almost in the pocket.""  ""It was a very intense game and very tight as well.  ""It was about not making a mistake and not giving the first goal away. After that we were 1-0 down.  ""We had good opportunities in the first half and we have to turn these into dangerous situations and finish them.  ""After that in the second half it was all us and we were a bit unlucky. We made a mistake on the second goal, and the second goal killed the game off."""
24,"           On a winter night in 373 BC, the classical Greek city of Helike was destroyed by a massive earthquake and tidal wave. The entire city and all its inhabitants were lost beneath the sea. What has bewitched archaeologists about Helike is that it was engulfed just when ancient Greece was reaching its height; when the philosophy and art that inspired the western world for thousands of years were invented.    Inspiring the myth     Its destruction was one of the most appalling tragedies of the classical world and most probably the reality behind the myth of Atlantis. But now, unlike Atlantis, a team of archaeologists may have found Helike - a lost city from the heyday of Greek civilisation. If it is as well preserved as everyone hopes, Helike could be a time capsule from this crucial time in human development.     For centuries there had been just no sign of it. All archaeologists had to guide them were obscure and often contradictory ancient texts. So, despite numerous expeditions trawling the waters off the coast of Greece and vast amounts of money and technology thrown at the problem, no one could find anything except two small coins, unearthed over a hundred years ago.    Not drowned but buried     Then, in 1988 Dora Katsonopoulou and Steven Soter took up the challenge. Dora had grown up with the legend from childhood and was determined to find the archaeological treasure on her doorstep. Together they went back to basics and re-examined the ancient texts. These said that Helike had sunk into a poros, which everyone had taken to mean Gulf of Corinthe. But Dora thought that a poros could also be an inland lagoon. If she was right, the lost city which had inspired Atlantis might not be under the sea, as everyone thought, but somewhere inland.    A landscape on the move     Studying the geology of the region, earthquake expert Iain Stewart argues that a large earthquake could well cause an inland lagoon. Small recent earthquakes in the region have caused ground liquefaction - a terrifying phenomenon where the ground literally turns to water beneath your feet. If the same had happened on a much larger scale then the whole city could have been plunged downwards, taking much of the city below sea level. But the earthquake in 373 BC could also have had a second more devastating effect. As well as liquifaction recent earthquakes have caused chunks of coastline to fall into the sea. If this happened on a large scale underwater landslides could cause a large wave, or tsunami. This would race across the Gulf of Corinthe, ricochet off the opposite bank and come charging back again, to crash over the sunken plain and fill in the lagoon.      Dora's theory makes sense, except for one thing. There is no lagoon in the region today. There is, though, a trail of clues that explains what could have happened. An ancient bridge that is strangely nowhere near water shows how river sediment coming down from the mountains changes the shape of the plain - over hundreds of years the lagoon would have silted up, hiding the lost city beneath solid ground. A host of boreholes drilled into the plain and a remote cave with the legend attached to it have helped pinpoint where the now underground city might lie.     Glimpses of Ancient Greece     Slowly Dora and Steven have pieced it all together, but there have been several false starts along the way. The first lot of ruins they found were Roman - a settlement built hundreds of years after Helike's disappearance to honour the famous lost city. Next they found ruins that turned out to be prehistoric - an early bronze age settlement built 2,500 years before Helike. It wasn't until 2001 that Dora and Steven at last got their breakthrough.     Whilst Horizon was filming, the team uncovered ruins from classical Greece. Securely dated by coins and pottery, the team are convinced they have at last found the city they've been looking for. It will take years to uncover Helike's riches, but for the first time in thousands of years, we have glimpses of the lost city that inspired Atlantis.

25,"The Ice Hockey Superleague (ISL) has been accused of being in ""complete disarray"" following the collapse of a deal to televise games from the sport's top-flight.  The ISL has begun legal action against Premium TV Ltd (PTV), the company granted television rights for the next four years.  PTV is planning to launch a new UK sports channel in the spring and is also involved with the Eurosport channel.  The ISL claims that PTV has failed to stick to a rights agreement dating back to November last year.  Under the deal, PTV,a subsidiary of NTL, was granted exclusive television broadcasting rights for four years. ISL chief executive Ian Taylor said: """"We felt we could not let this pass unchallenged and therefore had no choice but to file this lawsuit. ""We are devastated that our fans have been unable to watch their favourite sport on TV so far this season as a result of PTV's failure to broadcast any of our games. ""As a business, we have suffered considerably, most importantly through the loss of sponsorships and because PTV held the exclusive rights, we were unable to seek an alternative broadcaster."" PTV has refused to comment publicly on the court action. However, sources close to the deal have told BBC Sport Online they blame the ISL for its collapse and claim the league is in disarray. BBC Sport Online understands that PTV executives feel the broadcast rights have been devalued by the departure of Cardiff Devils and Newcastle Jesters and the uncertainty that led Sheffield Steelers to start their season late. It is also understood that other UK broadcasters have already made clear they are not interested in televising Superleague ice hockey."

28,"Entertainer Ronnie Corbett, best known for BBC comedy sketch show The Two Ronnies, has died aged 85.  His publicist said: ""Ronnie Corbett CBE, one of the nation's best-loved entertainers, passed away this morning, surrounded by his loving family.  ""They have asked that their privacy is respected at this very sad time.""  Corbett was one of the UK's best-loved comedians and along with Ronnie Barker; their double act was one of the most successful of the 1970s and '80s.  The entertainer had been suffering from ill-health for some time and had been in hospital in 2014 with gall bladder problems.  Following Barker's death in 2005, Corbett continued to be regular fixture on UK TV and is perhaps best-known for his armchair ""shaggy dog"" sketches.  His most memorable solo projects include the sitcom Sorry! and the game show Small Talk. He most recently starred in the BBC Radio 4 sitcom When the Dog Dies.  Sir Bruce Forsyth spoke emotionally about his friend, colleague and fellow golf enthusiast, saying it was ""one of the saddest days of my life"".  ""Ronnie was a friend, someone I admired so much. It's a very, very sad day. I'm going to miss him like crazy, I really will.""  Sir Bruce said one of the first times he saw Corbett was when he was working in the cast of a Danny La Rue show in the West End.  ""That was one of the wonderful things about Ronnie - he was very adaptable. He could work with anybody, even me,"" he said. ""We always say a one-off, but he certainly was a one-off and a half. He really was.""  Veteran comedian and actor John Cleese, who worked with Corbett on The Frost Report, tweeted: ""Just heard about Ronnie C. So sad. He had the best timing I've ever watched. He was a great, kind mentor and a wonderfully witty companion.""  Comedian Ricky Gervais, who appeared alongside Corbett in his TV show, Extras, tweeted: ""RIP the lovely, funny legend Ronnie Corbett. It was an absolute honour and joy to have known him.""  Little Britain star David Walliams, added: ""Goodbye my friend and comedy idol Ronnie Corbett Thank you for all the laughs. It was the greatest honour to know and work with you. Goodnight.""  Movie star Russell Crowe, added: ""And it's good night from Ronnie Corbett. Thanks for all the laughs mate.""  And comedy star Miranda Hart, said: ""Having a little weep at the death of one of my heroes Ronnie Corbett.""  Former BBC chairman Michael Grade also spoke of his sadness at the loss of Corbett, who he described as a ""huge talent"".  He told the BBC the entertainer was ""one of the all-time greats of British comedy, no question - I'm so sad for [his wife] Anne and the family - and the nation, really. We've lost a great friend and entertainer.  ""He learned his craft the hard way. He was a master of comedy of all kinds - TV, cabaret, variety. The most wonderful man.""  ""A man of great charm and warmth who brought laughter and joy to millions. He was quite simply one of the true greats of British comedy.""  It was one of the West End's great disasters. Lionel Bart's Robin Hood musical Twang closed after just 43 performances but it was a stroke of good luck for a young Ronnie Corbett.  Over cucumber sandwiches at The Ritz with David Frost he had been offered a starring role in his new satirical TV programme, The Frost Report.  Suddenly freed from his duties as Will Scarlett, it was Corbett's big break in TV and paired him up with another performer, Ronnie Barker.  And why had Frost chosen Corbett? He had seen him in a show in a London nightclub with Danny La Rue.  There, in one story, is one of the main reasons Ronnie Corbett was such a popular performer - acting, revue, the 1960s satire boom, music hall - he brought it all together at the right time and the right place in one five-foot-one performer.  Scottish-born Corbett started his TV comedy career on David Frost's satirical comedy the Frost Report in 1960.  It was here he first worked with Barker, although they had met before, and formed the duo whose TV sketch show became a British TV classic, regularly cited by the public as one of their enduring favourites and by other comics as a big influence on their careers.  The Two Ronnies ran from 1971 to 1987 and saw the comedians take part in musical performances and sketches.  Speaking to The Telegraph about how well they got on in 2013 he said of Barker: ""We were a real couple with matching tastes and styles.  ""Of course we were quite different but somehow we fitted so well together. I think it's a more pleasant and palatable thing to see people being funny together because you're touching areas of truth. Dinner parties or falling out with people - it's the naturalness of it.""  The programme won a Bafta in 1972 for best light entertainment performance and was staple viewing for much of the UK audience on a Saturday night, with more than 15 million viewers.  One of their most enduring sketches was the famous hardware shop ""fork handles"" skit.  When on his own, Corbett specialised in long, rambling jokes delivered from an outsize armchair with his legs dangling in the air.  Born in Edinburgh on 4 December 1930, Corbett was educated at the James Gillespie School and the Royal High School, Edinburgh.  He did not attend university after leaving school and instead joined the Ministry of Agriculture.  After two years he moved to London where his first roles were playing schoolboys due to his diminutive height of 5'1"".  Corbett also started to do summer seasons, intimate revues and running the bar at the Buckstone Club off Haymarket, central London, which is where he first met Barker.  He met his wife, the actress and singer Anne Hart, while working at Danny La Rue's Club in London.  It was here he was spotted by Frost who invited him to join Barker and Monty Python star John Cleese in The Frost Report, one of the most influential TV shows of the 1960s.  One of the satirical comedy series' best-known sketches featured Corbett, Barker and Cleese. The social ""class"" sketch saw the comedy actors ranked in height order, which also corresponded to their class.  Barker says: ""I look up to him [Cleese] because he is upper class, but I look down on him [Corbett] because he is lower class.""  Corbett says: ""I know my place.""  Following Barker's retirement in 1987, Corbett had a number of roles in the theatre, including The Seven Year Itch, Out of Order and The Dressmaker, while he also took guest roles on TV and in film.  He wrote books including Ronnie Corbett's Armchair Golf, The Small Man's Guide To Life and his autobiography High Hopes. He was also a keen and proficient golfer, and a member of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers.  He was awarded a CBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for his services to entertainment and charity.  Corbett is survived by his wife, with whom he celebrated his golden wedding anniversary last year, and the couple's two daughters, actresses Emma and Sophie Corbett."
29,"At least 20 people were reported dead in the clashes in the capital. There were also reports of unrest elsewhere.  Mr Garang, Sudan's newly appointed vice-president, died in a helicopter crash as he was returning from Uganda.  He signed a deal to end 21 years of civil war in January and was sworn in as deputy leader three weeks ago.  His former rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), has nominated deputy leader Salva Kiir as his successor and the next vice-president of Sudan.  The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum says that in choosing Mr Kiir, the SPLM has sent a clear message that there will be no radical departure from the Garang era.  US President George W Bush, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and others joined Mr Kiir in urging the Sudanese people to remain calm and continue to implement the peace agreement.  Our correspondent says gangs of youths from southern Sudan - Mr Garang's home - appeared on the streets, looting cars, throwing stones and smashing office windows.  Gunfire could be heard and there were clashes with security forces as they tried to seal off the city centre.  However, shortly after an overnight curfew was imposed at 1800 (1500 GMT), there was an eerie calm on the streets, our correspondent reports.  Mr Garang steered the SPLM rebels from the Christian and animist south through a war against the Islamic government in the north which left some 1.5m people dead.  Our correspondent says many of the 4m southern Sudanese living in Khartoum hoped Mr Garang would change their lives, and they are now venting their frustration at his death.  Mr Garang's death leaves a gaping hole in Sudan's political landscape, our correspondent says.  Three days of national mourning have been declared.  The Ugandan presidential Mi-72 helicopter carrying Mr Garang back from a meeting with President Yoweri Museveni at his ranch in Rwakitura crashed in mountains near Mr Garang's base in New Site, southern Sudan.  Six of his associates and the seven-member crew also died in the crash, which has been blamed on bad weather.  Mr Garang had ruled the disparate SPLM with an iron hand, and managed to keep it together through years of fighting.  The conflict in Sudan ended with the signing of a peace agreement in January and Mr Garang became vice-president in a new government of national unity.  Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir said he was confident the peace agreement would remain on course."
30,"The inspiration for the design is Roman - complete with doors including the letters S.P.Q.L. which are an adaptation of ‘Senatus Populusque Romanus’ and mean to the Senate and People of Liverpool! It's not called The Great Hall for nothing. The hall is 169 feet long including recesses at both ends and 74 feet wide including balconies. The long sides of the hall are divided in 5 bays by columns made of polished porphyry. The Organ    This was added by Cockerell and was intended as the musical foundation for events in the hall. The addition of the organ required that 2 of the original granite columns be removed, these were eventually transferred to the entrance of Sefton Park. Play us a tune on the old joanna. The bellows for the organ were originally powered by the steam engine in the basement but in 1931 the organ was enlarged to 120 stops (from 100) and converted to electro-pneumatic action.    The first organist was Mr WT Best in 1855, after the opening. The refurbishment of the organ will cost nearly £500,000 and is aimed to be completed in line with the other works. It is made of two sections. The central sunken section and the outside border. Made of encaustic tiles by Minton there are an estimated 30,000 tiles used. The difference in wear between the two sections is due to the decision taken in 1860 to cover the central well with a wooden floor to provide a more suitable surface for dancing."
31,The original plans for the building did not allow for the ventilation system which was recommended at a later date.  The aim of the system was to warm and ventilate the building without draughts.   Fresh air was brought into the building via shafts at the eastern portico and the used air expelled through grilles in the ceiling into the roof spaces.  The air was warmed by five hot water pipes heated by two coke-fired boilers and two steam boilers.   Four ten foot-wide fans distributed the air and circulated air for cooling.  Control of the air into and out of the individual rooms was largely manual and involved an army of workers opening and closing a series of canvas flaps.  Only two rooms could control their own heating. The judges and court clerks had a system of valves beneath their benches.  The system no longer works but the refurbishment will restore some of it as a display piece.
32,"After the courts moved in the 1980’s to their current buildings, St George’s Hall was left unloved, unused and under funded for nearly 20 years. Then in the early 1990’s money began to trickle in to attempt to repair the crumbling building.It is soon to be closed in parts for complete refurbishment to return it to its former glory. Before the hall was built the site was occupied by the first Liverpool Infirmary from 1749 to 1824. It also included a Seaman's Hospital, Medical Library and Lunatic Asylum. The seaman's hospital was mainly supported by a levy of sixpence a month, which was deducted from the pay of the seamen sailing in the ships registered in Liverpool. The foundation stone of St George's Hall was laid in 1838 to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria, but the actual building of the hall did not start until 1842. The idea for the hall came from Liverpool citizens who were concerned about the lack of a place for the triennial music festivals. To fund it a subscription list was set up with shares available at £25 each and by January 1837 £23,350 had been raised.    However as usual, when building work commenced it went over budget. At the same time a venue was being sought for the Civil and Crown Courts and fortuitously the same architect was employed to design both buildings so it was decided that one building would serve all needs. It is possibly the only building where you could be tried for murder, have a ball or listen to a concert all under one roof."
33,"Hawks are being used to scare seagulls and pigeons away from Brighton & Hove Albion's new £93m ground.  The club said the birds of prey would deter pigeons from nesting and help keep the Amex stadium clean.  Operations manager Richard Hebberd said the birds would be brought in at regular intervals.  He said: ""They just scare everything in their territory so after a while the pigeons and the seagulls learn to not go to a particular location.""  Since they left the Goldstone Ground in 1997, the club have been without a permanent home.  But after sharing with Gillingham and then using the Withdean athletics stadium, they kicked-off the season in the Championship at the Amex stadium on Saturday."
34,"With a pledge of free bananas for the town's children, football mascot H'angus the Monkey was the ""joke"" candidate to be mayor of Hartlepool.  Some 11 years later - and with three election victories under his belt - it seems Stuart Drummond, who leaves office on 5 May, was no comedy character.  A referendum in November signalled the end for the mayoral system and Hartlepool Council will instead be governed by committees.  Tapping away at his keyboard with framed Hartlepool United shirts and squad photographs behind him, Mr Drummond joked he had seen ""too much"" of his beloved team's relegation season.  He still has a season ticket at Victoria Park where his campaign began as a stunt.  ""I was always looking for something new to get a little bit of publicity for the club and just have a bit of fun along the way,"" he said.  The club's chairman loaned his mischievous mascot the £500 deposit and things soon got serious.  ""Never for one second did I expect to win,"" he said. ""I hadn't prepared for anything, it was a case of winging it and making it up as I went along.""  Mr Drummond, a father-of-three, said he had an ""extended honeymoon period"" with those outside the civic centre, but not some of the councillors he was working alongside.  ""The public saw me as one of them and almost put a protective arm around me to support me through those early years.  ""Getting the respect and credibility from councillors? I probably haven't even got it from some of them now, but that was always going to be a challenge.""  There was a ""huge shift"" in attitudes, Mr Drummond said, when he was re-elected in 2005 with a majority of more than 10,000.  He looks back over his tenure with pride.  ""I've been quite overwhelmed by the support I've been given from people and the amount of people who have expressed their disappointment at what's happened,"" he said.  ""If all those people had voted in the referendum we might have had a different result.""  The mayor insisted the result of the poll does not rankle with him personally as he would not have stood for a fourth term.  ""It's a shame that nobody else will get the opportunity to step into my shoes and bring a fresh pair of eyes to it and take it to the next stage,"" he said.  ""It's not really the system of governance that's important, it's about how the town fares and the decisions that are made.""  Having one directly-accountable figurehead for the town has helped Hartlepool punch above its weight, Mr Drummond believes.  ""Hartlepool is like one of the biggest villages in the country. There's a strong community spirit and a lot of local pride here.  ""To have somebody to be able to promote that on a regional, national and international basis is a big benefit.""  Hosting the Tall Ships in 2010 gave the town a huge boost in confidence, the mayor said.  ""For us to bring the world to Hartlepool and see so many people smiling and enjoying themselves, that doesn't really happen that often.  ""Every day in this role you're always trying to improve things and make people feel better in their own lives. The Tall Ships did it perfectly.""  Mr Drummond took a deep breath before describing the ""most challenging"" role of his life.  Soon after joining Cleveland Police Authority, he found himself elevated to chair.  ""Little did I realise the 12 months that lay ahead,"" he said.  ""I didn't realise the state the authority was in. It was on the verge of government intervention because it was so poorly governed.""  Operation Sacristy, a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption at the authority, began in May 2011, six months before Mr Drummond took over.  The investigation continues and the former chief constable and deputy chief constable have been sacked for gross misconduct in recent months following separate misconduct hearings.  ""If it was a TV drama it would be quite hard to believe,"" Mr Drummond said.  ""In the fullness of time everything will be made available and people will make their own conclusions. All I can say is I wouldn't want to go through that again.""  If Mr Drummond breathed a sigh of relief on leaving his police role, his wife Rebecca will be even happier when he leaves his current job.  ""She cannot wait for 6 May when I won't be elected mayor anymore. She doesn't like the attention it brings and some of the publicity. She's really looking forward to it.""  So what does the future hold? There are, Mr Drummond said, ""a couple of irons in the fire"".  ""I've had some interviews recently and I've been telling some of these tales and people have been flabbergasted.  ""From day one the whole thing has been unconventional. It's not a bad thing to have on your CV I don't suppose.  ""Whatever I do next I will always be banging the drum for Hartlepool.  ""That's in my blood now."""
35,"The 30-year-old moves to United on a free transfer, after a clause in his contract enabled him to leave after Swindon's relegation to League Two.  Meanwhile, veteran defender Steve Jenkins will not be offered a new contract by Swindon when his current deal expires at the end of June.  The 34-year-old is now free to leave the County Ground.  Cureton told BBC Essex: ""There's been a lot of speculation and I'm glad it's all sorted now. Being here last season has played a massive part in my coming back.  ""It's not like joining a new club and the fans were good to me last season. I'd have been happy to stay until the end of last season but Swindon wanted me back and I went and did a professional job and tried my hardest to keep the club up.  ""I think Colchester are a club where I feel comfortable and settled and when that happens I play my best football and it's a nice close knit club and I'm happy to be a part of it again."""
36,"Hundreds of mourners gathered for the funeral of Private Arthur Foster, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was 27 when he died.  He was killed in World War Two during the doomed attempt to capture the bridge at Arnhem in 1944.  The ceremony was held at Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery on Wednesday.  The failed operation which claimed the life of Pte Foster was known as ""Operation Market Garden"".  The service was conducted by the Rev Robert Williams, chaplain of the First Battalion of the King's Own Royal Border Regiment (KORBR), which recruits from north Lancashire and Cumbria.  Mr Williams said: ""By the honour of this special event and ceremony we show no particulars or favourites. Pte Foster would not want that.  ""In saluting him we salute him and all his comrades, whose lives were laid down or taken in the cause of freedom.""  War veterans were also among those at the ceremony.  After the war, Pte Foster was one of 33 soldiers from the Border Regiment with no known grave commemorated on the Groesbeek Memorial near Nijmegen.  Workmen discovered his almost-complete remains early in 2003 when a barn was demolished near Oosterbeek.  Pte Foster's family were only traced in August last year.  His niece, Mrs Sheldon, said: ""I think my uncle would have been highly honoured.  ""It is especially good that he should be buried with his friends and comrades, so they are all together.""  Mrs Sheldon said it was a ""complete shock"" when she found out her uncle's body had been discovered."
37,"A 14-year-old girl who wanted her body to be preserved, in case she could be cured in the future, won a historic legal fight shortly before her death.  The girl, who was terminally ill with a rare cancer, was supported by her mother in her wish to be cryogenically preserved - but not by her father.  She wrote to the judge explaining that she wanted ""to live longer"" and did not want ""to be buried underground"".  The girl, who died in October, has been taken to the US and preserved there.  A High Court judge ruled that the girl's mother should be allowed to decide what happened to the body.  The details of her case have just been released.  The teenager, who lived in the London area and cannot be named, used the internet to investigate cryonics during the last months of her life.  ""I have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done.  ""I am only 14 years old and I don't want to die but I know I am going to die.  ""I think being cryopreserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up - even in hundreds of years' time.  ""I don't want to be buried underground.  ""I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they may find a cure for my cancer and wake me up.  ""I want to have this chance.  ""This is my wish.""  The judge, Mr Justice Peter Jackson, visited the girl in hospital and said he was moved by ""the valiant way in which she was facing her predicament"".  His ruling, he said, was not about the rights or wrongs of cryonics but about a dispute between parents over the disposal of their daughter's body.  It was brought to court for the first time on 26 September and the judge made his decision on 6 October.  Cryonics is the process of preserving a whole body in the hope that resuscitation and a cure are possible in the distant future.  It is a controversial procedure and no-one yet knows if it is possible to bring people back to life.  There are facilities in the US and Russia where bodies can be preserved in liquid nitrogen at very low temperatures (less than -130C) - but not in the UK.  The cost of preserving the body for an infinite amount of time in this case was £37,000, which was paid by the girl's mother's family.  Chrissie de Rivaz, from Cornwall, has decided to be cryogenically preserved after her death - as has her husband John - and she has committed £28,000 to the plan.  ""I can't see any reason to just send me up the flume and I hate the idea of being buried in the ground, so why not take this chance to come back again?""  Simon Woods, an expert in medical ethics from Newcastle University, thinks the whole idea is science fiction.  He said: ""The diagnosis of death is that death is irreversible, and for people who seek cryopreservation, they've died of a serious disease, in this case it's cancer.  ""The person is in a pretty bad state of health to begin with, and there's absolutely no scientific evidence that the person could be brought back to life.""  The girl's solicitor, Zoe Fleetwood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it had been a ""great privilege"" to be involved with the case of an ""extraordinary individual"".  When the girl was told about the court's decision, she had been ""delighted"" and referred to the judge as ""Mr Hero Peter Jackson"", her lawyer said.  ""It was a difficult process. Some might say the girl's mother's attention was directed towards that procedure rather than grieving at this time,"" Ms Fleetwood added.  ""But her daughter had passed away, the procedure needed to be carried out.""  The case had not set a precedent for future cases around cryopreservation, she said.  The girls' parents were divorced and the girl had not had any contact with her father for six years before she became ill.  While the girl's mother supported her wishes to have her body preserved, her father was against it.  He said: ""Even if the treatment is successful and she is brought back to life in let's say 200 years, she may not find any relative and she might not remember things and she may be left in a desperate situation given that she is only 14 years old and will be in the United States of America.""  Although he then changed his mind, saying he respected his daughter's decision, he subsequently wanted to see his daughter's body after her death - something to which she would not agree.  The judge said the girl's application was the only one of its kind to have come before a court in England and Wales - and probably anywhere else.  Mr Justice Jackson said the case was an example of science posing new questions to lawyers.  The girl died peacefully in October knowing that her remains would be preserved, but the judge said there had been problems on the day she died.  He said hospital staff and bosses had expressed concerns about the way the process of preparing her body for cryogenic preservation had been handled.  This was carried out by a voluntary group in the UK before her body was flown to the US for storage.  He suggested that ministers should consider ""proper regulation"" of cryonic preservation for the future."
38,"Britain hasn't always been obsessed by skinny decaf lattés - back in the 1950s it was all about tea. Our tea consumption then was 50 times that of coffee and while coffee bars did exist they were more of a refuge for artists and writers than a grab and go style accessory.  As recently as the 1980s, if you asked a Briton what sort of coffee they drank, it was invariably an instant variety.  About the closest Britain came to excitement in the coffee stakes was the advertising for the most high-profile brands of the day, such as Gold Blend and the ""will they, won't they"" storylines dreamed up for the suave, sophisticated couple pictured in the adverts.  Two Americans, Scott and Ali Svenson, came to the UK in 1990 from Seattle. Well used to a day-time diet of Starbucks coffee, their first experience of a British cafe was a disaster - all weak and watery, presented in a tasteful styrofoam cup. So was born the beginning of an empire, the Seattle Coffee Company and then Starbucks' UK invasion.  Seattle multiplied but, as it grew, others followed suit, and its 49 outlets were soon swallowed up by Starbucks, which went on to open an average of more than five stores every month in the UK from 1996 to 2000.  Prices paid for the prized high street locations spiralled until Starbucks forked out an eye-watering £1.5m in a Leicester Square rental deal.  As the competition struggled to compete, Starbucks kept running its expensive sites at a loss, prompting accusations that they were using their muscle to unfairly squeeze out the opposition.  Starbucks didn't just upset its rivals. Its drive for world dominance meant it was becoming a symbol of globalisation, and therefore a target for protestors.  Meanwhile, in 2002 Coffee Republic lost £7.5m. Caffe Nero struggled on under a debt mountain of £7m while casting around for possible takeover targets to gain a bigger share of the market.  Nowhere is the cappuccino conflict between cafe operators more obvious than in London, where some streets will have all four of the big players based within a stone's throw of each other.  Massimo Bergamen, area manager for the Costa group, is opening a new flagship store on the Strand in the heart of London's West End. But next door is Caffe Nero and Coffee Republic is on the other side of the road. It's a cut-throat business.  And is any of the coffee any good? Louis Salvone, coffee connoisseur and spokesman for the Real Coffee Society says quality varies a great deal. He sampled a Coffee Republic offering, specially for the Money Programme: ""Presentation good, still only tasting milk, still milk, now I'm getting the coffee hit ... well, the best espresso I had today was Costa's but the best cappuccino was probably Coffee Republic's, so there you go.""  It's not a resounding judgement. But, whoever wins the business battle, we've all fallen for the charms of the latté and the cappuccino - and coffee bars are now part of the British way of life.  First in a three part series looking at the war between high street stores. This first programme looks at the many coffee shops now fighting for our attention.  This programme was first transmitted on Wednesday 12 February 2003."
39,"Executives from some of the world's most-recognised firms have been grilled by MPs on the issue of tax avoidance.  The head of Google UK and top managers from Starbucks and Amazon appeared before the Public Accounts Committee.  Starbucks admitted the Dutch government had granted a special tax deal on its European headquarters, which receives royalty payments from its UK business.  Amazon and Google also confirmed they used favourable European tax jurisdictions for their UK businesses.  Amazon's sales are handled out of Luxembourg, while Google's advertising space is sold by a team in the Republic of Ireland, the executives confirmed.  Margaret Hodge, who chairs the parliamentary committee, told the BBC that she thought it was right for customers to boycott the three companies.  ""One of our concerns is that the ability of global companies to choose where to they put their costs and their profits gives them an unfair tax advantage that damages UK-based businesses,"" she said.  Starbucks has reported a taxable profit only once in its 15 years of operating in the UK.  ""We're not at all pleased about our financial performance here,"" the coffee chain's chief financial officer Troy Alstead told the committee. ""The most competitive coffee and espresso market we face is here in the UK.""  A four-month investigation by news agency Reuters revealed that Starbucks reportedly paid just £8.6m in corporation tax in the UK over 14 years - including reporting accounting losses when it was profitable.  Ms Hodge questioned why the company even continued to do business in the UK, if it was making such perennial losses.  The taxable profits of its UK business are calculated net of the royalty paid to its Netherlands regional headquarters.  Mr Alstead said that these royalties were subject to a combined tax rate in the Netherlands and the US of approximately 16%. The UK's main corporation tax rate is 24%.  Starbucks' royalty rate used to be 6% of sales, but was recently reduced to 4.7% after being challenged by the UK tax authorities.  The chief financial officer said the 6% royalty rate was paid by its businesses in other countries, including by independent licensees in 20 countries.  He said the royalty reflected costs incurred by the business outside the UK - including new products, store layout design, new machinery development and engineering services.  However, when challenged by the committee, he admitted that there was no detailed analysis of costs behind the 6% figure.  He denied that the Netherlands had been chosen as the company's regional headquarters because of its favourable tax rate, saying it was because the company had a major roasting plant located there.  All of Starbucks' businesses worldwide, including in the UK, buy their coffee from its Switzerland office, Mr Alstom also said, which charged a 20% markup on the price at which it bought its coffee in the wholesale market. The Swiss office paid a 12% tax rate on its profits, he said.  Mr Alstom insisted that the company does not use any tax havens, and pays a high tax rate worldwide.  MPs expressed frustration with Amazon's director of public policy, Andrew Cecil, who repeatedly said he would have to come back at a later date with information requested by the committee.  The information included the value of Amazon's sales in the UK, the pre-tax profits of the European company and the ownership structure of the European company.  Mr Cecil explained that sales on the amazon.co.uk website - and in all other European countries - were actually made by its Luxembourg-based European business, which employs 500 people.  Amazon's UK business, which employs about 15,000 people to manage deliveries, warehousing and other aspects of the UK business, operates as a service provider to the European company.  As such, the profits on the mark-up on the sales price are booked by the Luxembourg company.  Mr Cecil said that the Luxembourg business's turnover in 2011 was 9.1bn euros. It paid taxes of 8m euros and posted after-tax profits of 20m euros.  He said that Amazon had never publicly disclosed the country-by-country breakdown of its European sales.  According to a report by the Guardian, Amazon generated sales of more than £3.3bn in the UK last year but paid no corporation tax on any of the profits, and is under investigation by the UK tax authorities.  Mr Cecil confirmed that the company had received a 200m-euro payment demand from the French tax authorities, but refused to divulge whether any other countries were investigating the company's tax dealings.  Like Amazon, Google also operates its European business out of a favourable tax jurisdiction - in its case the Republic of Ireland - according to Matt Brittin, who runs company's northern European businesses.  He openly admitted that the choice of Ireland was due to its favourable 12.5% corporation tax rate.  He also confirmed that the rights to the company's non-US intellectual property rights were owned in the tax haven of Bermuda, saying that the company had a duty to shareholders to minimise its costs.  He further freely accepted that until recently, the Ireland company was paying a fee to a separate Dutch company within Google, purely for the purpose of reducing its taxes.  Like the other executives, Mr Brittin insisted that nothing his employer did was illegal, prompting the committee chair, Ms Hodge, to say: ""We're not accusing you of being illegal, we're accusing you of being immoral.""  Google's UK unit paid just £6m to the Treasury in 2011 on UK turnover of £395m, according to the Telegraph.  Google earns revenues in the UK when users of its UK search website click on links that business customers have paid Google to list at the top of the results for particular search terms.  Mr Brittin said this advertising space was sold by a team of 3,000 salespeople in its Ireland office - of which 200 deal with UK business customers.  However, he also admitted that the company employed 700 marketing consultants in the UK who, among other things, would refer clients to the Ireland sales team.  The executive insisted that the primary value provided by the company in the UK was not the sale of advertising space, but provided by its 17,000 engineers in California that creates the company's innovative technology - such as its search engine, mapping and translation services - which are mostly provided for free."

41,"Rolls-Royce is to close its UK defence operations in Ansty, near Coventry.  The union Unite has blamed government defence cuts for the closure, which will mean 378 job losses.  The company, which employs about 800 people at Ansty, said it hopes to avoid compulsory redundancies.  Unite national officer for aerospace and shipbuilding, Ian Waddell, said: ""The underlying reason for the job losses is the government's defence spending cuts.""  A spokesperson for Rolls-Royce said: ""We are in consultation with trade unions over reductions in our defence workforce at Ansty.  ""We hope to achieve this without compulsory redundancies.  ""In a large and complex company there is a continuing need to align resource and customer demand.""  A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said it had nothing to add to the company's statement.  A worker leaving the site told BBC Midlands Today the latest announcement ""makes the site look very insecure"".  Another said he hoped people laid off could be ""placed to other Rolls-Royce sites to find them jobs"".  In an email to MP Geoffrey Robinson the company said it proposed to ""progressively run down Defence Services work carried out at Ansty by a combination of natural termination of legacy programmes or re-location of on-going work to other facilities.""  It added: ""This is expected to take a number of years.""  Mr Robinson, MP for Coventry North West, said: ""I'm very shocked, there was no prior warning or indication of job losses.  ""We've got to resist this in any way we can. It's very bad news.""  He has contacted Business Secretary Vince Cable and Unite for an urgent meeting.  The proposed reductions are in response to an internal study that reviewed the Rolls-Royce defence aerospace business in Ansty and Bristol.  The site at Ansty, six miles to the east of Coventry City Centre, is also a base for civil aerospace business which is not expected to be affected."
42,"Their distinctive beige check, once associated with A-listers, has now become the uniform of a rather different social group: the so-called Chav.  With UK sales falling, Burberry cannot afford to become a laughing stock in their own backyard.  But just how does a top designer label shrug off a damaged image?  Only five years ago, Burberry was the darling of the fashion world after undergoing one of the most envied brand reinventions of recent years.  ""It really tapped into a sense of the early years of the millennia,"" says Andrea Cockram of Verdict Research.  But all too quickly, the brand became a victim of its own success.  ""It was associated with people who did bad stuff, who went wild on the terraces,"" says Peter York.  ""Quite a lot of people thought that Burberry would be worn by the person who mugged them.""  Burberry might have been appalled, but worse was to come.  The brand became something of a national joke when photos of former soap star Danniella Westbrook and her baby were splashed all over the papers.  Both were dressed from head to toe in Burberry check.  The issue refused to die down.  The Essex girl look was adopted all over the country, fed by a flood of counterfeit Burberry check at market stalls across Britain.  Britain discovered Chavs, and the association of Chavs with Burberry spawned a thousand tabloid jokes.  Last summer there was more bad news for Burberry, when pubs and clubs across the country began to ban customers who dressed in the label.  They removed the checked baseball caps from sale and reduced the visibility of their distinctive pattern.  Three years ago it was on a fifth of all products. By 2004 it was on less that 5%.  Burberry is now cracking down on the fake goods that allow what they might consider to be the wrong sort of people to look like they are wearing the brand.  But even this has had unexpected consequences.  Welsh rap band, Goldie Lookin' Chain were given a Vauxhall Cavalier with a distinctive Burberry check paint job.  Nicknamed the ""Chavalier"", the car was being auctioned off on EBay until Burberry's lawyers got in touch demanding that the car be destroyed for infringing their copyright.  It was not only the car that was crushed, says band member Eggsy.  ""I cried when they said you've got to destroy the car. What's next? Taking Rupert the Bear to court for having trousers that looked like Burberrys?""  There was more bad news earlier this year. Kate Moss, whose recent high-profile campaigns to promote the brand made her into the face of Burberry, is now facing tabloid allegations of drug-taking.  Burberry's Chief Executive Rose Marie Bravo is stepping down next year in favour of fellow American Angela Ahrendts, and the Chavs issue is likely to be near the top of her in-tray.  But there is reason for hope.  Most of Burberry's sales are overseas, so although sales in the UK have been sliding, international profits for last year reached over £160m.

The fire swept through the 330ft-long complex after the blaze was reported in its roof early on Friday morning at Seaborough Manor near Beaminster.  Fifty firefighters were involved in tackling the incident for up to three hours.  Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said crews would stay at the scene overnight and an investigation has been launched.  A fire service spokeswoman said: ""There was an asbestos roof involved in the fire with no affect to any other properties. Crews were at work protecting adjacent piggeries and property.  ""There was 100% severe damage to the piggery and sadly approximately 900 pigs lost their lives in the fire.  ""Firefighters will be in attendance through the night keeping an eye on the site.""  In May last year, 180 piglets and 18 sows died in a fire at Corton Farm in Friar Waddon, Weymouth in Dorset.  The large farrowing unit suffered severe fire damage and none of the pigs survived."
44,"More than 200 billion CDs have been sold worldwide since then and it remains the dominant format despite the growth in digital downloads.  The CD was jointly developed by Philips and Sony and the disc has also become a key storage method for computer users.  The first CD produced was The Visitors by Abba.  Piet Kramer, who was a member of the optical group at Philips during the disc's development, said: ""When Philips teamed up with Sony to develop the CD, our first target was to win over the world for the CD.  ""We did this by collaborating openly to agree on a new standard. For Philips, this open innovation was a new approach and it paid off.""  He said the companies had never imagined that the computing and entertainment industries would also opt for the CD as a storage system for content.  Jacques Heemskerk, who was one of the senior engineers involved with the optical side of CD players, said the team knew they were building a revolutionary product.  ""It was revolutionary in many fields - the optics were new, the disc was new. At the start of development there wasn't even a laser that would work well enough for our needs.  ""The most advanced laser at the time had a lifespan of only 100 hours.""  He said the company had always planned on the format lasting at least 20 to 25 years.  ""That was the model we had in mind although it seems that CD is going to last a lot longer than that. For many people the CD is still the original format, with others being derivative or back-ups.""  The two companies began work on the format in 1979 and targetted a disc which could hold an hour of audio. The capacity was extended to 74 minutes, however, to accommodate a complete performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, forcing the disk to be made slightly larger.""  ""I always wish we had stuck with the original plan for an 11cm disc; it would have been more suited to the on-the-go age,"" said Mr Heemskerk.  He said that it had been a big culture shock for Philips when they had allied with Sony.  ""The world was not as globalised as it is today. Our management had told us to be as open as possible and to share everything because that was the only way to have success.  ""But we were suspicious and so were their engineers. But after a few days it became clear we could work together.""  He added: ""There were other companies working on similar technologies, so there was pressure.  ""We always knew we could make the product but it was always about making it for the right cost and at scale.""  The first CDs went on sale in November 1982 and were mainly classical recordings.  Classical music lovers were believed to be more affluent than pop and rock music fans, and Philips thought they would be more inclined to pay the price for the more expensive CDs and the very expensive CD-players,  The first models cost 2,000 Dutch guilders, about £1,000 at today's rate, taking into account inflation.  ""When Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau recorded one of the first CDs for Polygram we discovered that he was grunting and panting while playing. Before on vinyl you didn't hear that but on CD it was crystal clear,"" said Frank van den Berg, a former member of the Polygram CD development task force.  In the last 10 years CD sales have been dropping worldwide while digital download sales are rising rapidly.  According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), digital sales will account for a quarter of all worldwide music sales by 2010.  CD sales in the UK have dropped 10% in the first half of this year, while download purchases have increased by 50%.  Richard Gooch, head of technology at IFPI, said: ""CDs remain a very popular format for buying music in the digital era - indeed as CDs are a digital format they actually kick-started the digital age.  ""The CD remained the most popular Christmas present in Britain last year. Despite the rise of downloading we expect that the CD will be here for many years to come.""  Mr Heemskerk said CDs remained his format of choice.  ""I don't have an iPod, although my youngest son uses one. But CDs are still his preferred format and he copies them on to his MP3 player."""
45,"The Discovery Channel International Balloon Fiesta takes place from Thursday, 7 August to Sunday, 10 August 2008, at its traditional venue, Bristol’s Ashton Court Estate.  The Fiesta regularly draws crowds of up to half a million people from across the country, combining the spectacle of mass hot-air balloon ascents with a daily programme of entertainment and children’s activities - and it is all free of charge.  The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta was first held in 1979 in Ashton Court with just 29 balloons and a few thousand spectators.  This year the fiesta includes mass launches of 120 hot air balloons each morning and evening from Friday to Sunday (6am and 6pm, weather permitting), and the Night Glows which combine illuminated balloons, fireworks and music at 9.30pm on Thursday and Saturday.  The ‘Heaven’ area gives Fiesta visitors a chance to take life at a slightly more relaxed pace.  ‘Heaven’ became part of the event in 2004, as an area which provides quirky and innovative entertainment – almost a festival within a fiesta.  Event Director, Susan Tanner was awarded the prestigious Event Organiser of the Year trophy by fellow industry professionals in January.  The often weird but always wonderful, special shape balloons will be taking to the skies once more. Look out for Fiesta favourites including the Churchill dog, the Kiwi bird, the Stroud and Swindon house and the Scottish Piper."
46,"+ The two Night Glows are on Thursday 12 August and Saturday 14 August. + They start at around 2100 BST, and last around an hour. + The start time can sometimes vary if the balloon pilots have to travel back far from the evening's mass ascent. + The firework display starts at the end of the Night Glow. Thousands head to Ashton Court to see tethered balloons and the 'naked' basket and burners light up in time to music. There are some good spots to see the event, and make sure you don't miss out on the fireworks afterwards. Probably the most obvious is the hill by Church Wood, which last year looked something like Henman Hill at Wimbledon! The problem with the hill is that everyone plans to get there early, and bags their spot hours before. So if you want to grab a bit of the view, we suggest you take a picnic basket, rug, and warm clothing and get there before the mass ascent at 1800. If you can't get up on the hill, then the next best place is ringside at the bottom of that hill. Get as close as you can to the fence to make sure you can see, and don't fall foul to some tall bloke standing in front of you. Again, this area fills up very quickly during the evening, but you should be okay to arrive some time between 1900 and 2000 to get a good spot. The rookie mistake to make at the Night Glow is to go the other side of the arena - there's a very good reason it fills up last.  You can't see the fireworks very well because of the tree line. The display is usually spectacular, with many of the rockets sounding like artillery shells being fired. The only advantage to being this side is its proximity to the car park - which considering the bridge is closed this year, could be quite a bonus.  It depends how desperate you are to get home quickly! Of course, if you decide to miss part of the Night Glow during the rush back to the car, you can always watch it later here on bbc.co.uk/bristol. If you are extremely jammy, the ultimate view of the Night Glow is from the hospitality tents.  Time to start pleading with the boss ...  "
47,"The sheep have been released on a hillside beside the M8 between junctions three and four and is the brainchild of Pyramid Business Park.  The stunt in Bathgate was set up ""for a bit of fun"" to ""brighten things up"".  Farmer Andrew Jack, who owns the 54-strong flock, spent hours spray painting the woolly mammals. They will be red for a month until sheared.  He said: ""They are causing quite a stir with passers-by. It is a bit of fun and it does brighten things up.  ""It was a bit messy and it really did take a while, but they look fantastic.  ""We used a sheep spray, but it was totally animal friendly and would not do them any harm. We will leave them like that until it is time to shear their coats off.""  It comes after the M8 Art project which created artistic talking points along the main travel corridor between east and west.  The 'Sawtooth Ramps', which quickly became known as the pyramids, were the first to be installed in 1993 by artist Patricia Leighton.  They were followed by the 80 foot high 'Horn', which transmits recorded music, poetry and prose, the 'Big Heids' at Eurocentral Terminal site and the Iron Horse at Easterhouse.  Craig Chalmers, senior facilities manager at Pyramids Business Park, said: ""We wanted to do something different to brighten up the area and make it a nicer place to work.  ""The sheep have become a huge attraction. They look fantastic and they serve the double process of maintaining the grass on the pyramids.  ""The dyes are obviously animal friendly and we are now considering replacing them with pink sheep when these ones have their coats sheared."""

49,"Pakistan's president has directed that there should be no official celebrations of Independence Day on Saturday as the country tries to cope with devastating floods.  Asif Ali Zardari will instead spend the day touring affected regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces.  He has been heavily criticised at home for not taking a more direct role.  The region's worst flooding in 80 years has affected 14 million and killed 1,600, according to the UN.  Flood levels are expected to surge even higher along parts of the already dangerously swollen Indus river, with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) saying ""major peaks"" were expected next week in Punjab and Sindh provinces.  Mr Zardari has been bitterly criticised by opposition politicians and the media for pressing ahead with his European tour last week as the country was devastated by the floods.  He spent Thursday visiting affected areas in Sukkur in Sindh province, and has said that although he will still visit Russia next week, he will stay only a few hours instead of the scheduled two days.  His spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, said in a statement on Friday: ""President Asif Ali Zardari has directed that in view of the floods, no Independence Day celebrations will be held in the Presidency this year.  ""He will spend the day with the flood-affected people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.""  The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says there will be no special official gatherings or flag-raising ceremonies. Special parades at military corps headquarters will not take place and official buildings will not be specially lit.  The annual gathering and civic awards ceremony at the president's house will also not take place. Major firework, cultural and music shows will be cancelled.  Our correspondent says people will still be free to celebrate the public holiday as they see fit but such celebrations may be low-key this year as the mood is sombre. He says it is unlikely many objections will be raised to the president's move, with many appreciating that ostentatious festivities would be inappropriate.  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on Saturday and will hold talks with officials and visit flood-affected areas the following day.  The UN on Wednesday launched a $459m (£294m) appeal for emergency aid but says billions will be needed in the long-term.  The president welcomed Mr Ban's visit, Mr Babar said, adding that ""the colossal damage to life, property, livestock and infrastructure was so huge that it could be faced only with the concerted efforts of the people of Pakistan and the support and assistance of the international community"".  NDMA spokesman Ahmed Kamal warned there could be ""further devastation as we are expecting two major peaks in the Indus system"".  He said places downstream of the Kotri barrage - a flood barrier in Sindh - and areas on either side of the Taunsa barrage in Punjab were likely to take the brunt of this surge.  Several villages in Thatta district, downstream of Kotri, have been evacuated. It is a big agricultural zone that has some of the richest farms in the country.  Our correspondent, M Ilyas Khan, says the cost of agricultural losses is still hard to quantify.  Minister for Food and Agriculture Nazar Mohammad Gondal put the figure at ""billions of rupees"", although agricultural associations have been more specific.  The Crops Protection Association put the loss of the cotton crop alone at $1.8bn.  The Agricultural Farms Association said 17 million acres of farm land was under water, with 100,000 cattle and more than one million tonnes of privately stored wheat lost. Some 3,000 fish farms, 2,000 poultry farms and 1,000 tractors had been destroyed, it said.  Aid agencies continue to struggle to cope with the scale of the disaster.  Jacques de Maio, head of operations for South Asia at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said: ""Clearly at this point in time, the overall relief effort cannot keep pace with the overall scale of the emergency.""  Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani vowed that ""every single penny"" of aid would be accounted for.  Medics in a relief camp in southern Punjab told the BBC the main challenges they faced were gastroenteritis, diarrhoea and skin infections.  But they are also increasingly worried about malaria, which is being worsened by all the stagnant water.  BBC World Service's Newshour will broadcast a one-hour programme on the Pakistan floods, hosted by Lyse Doucet from Karachi, at 1200 GMT on Saturday 14 August."

A Markus Heikkinen header made it 4-1 and Edwards turned in Vine's deflected cross to complete Leeds' misery.  Luton boss Mike Newell:   ""I imagine it will have been a long time since Luton beat a club like Leeds 5-1.  ""We started quite well and, although they came back into the match towards the end of the first half, we felt that if we could score the second goal, more would follow.

53,"Henry Allingham was the last surviving founding member of the RAF Henry Allingham, the world's oldest man and one of the last surviving World War I servicemen, has died at the age of 113, his care home has said. Mr Allingham served with the Royal Naval Air Service in WWI, later transferring to the Royal Air Force at the time of its creation. Last month, Mr Allingham, born in 1896, became the world's oldest man. The Queen said he was ""one of the generation who sacrificed so much for us all"". A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said the Queen's ""thoughts are with his family during this time"". Bosses at his Brighton care home said everybody was ""saddened by Henry's loss and our sympathy goes to his family"". His funeral will take place later this month at St Nicholas' Church in Brighton. Mr Allingham, whose life has spanned three centuries and six monarchs, has five grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, 14 great-great grandchildren and one great-great-great grandchild. His wife Dorothy, who he was married to for more than half a century, died in 1970. Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to the war hero, calling him a ""tremendous character"". ""I had the privilege of meeting Henry many times. He was a tremendous character, one of the last representatives of a generation of tremendous characters,"" he said. He added: ""My thoughts are with his family as they mourn his passing but celebrate his life."" And Prince Charles described Mr Allingham as ""belonging to that incredible generation who did so much for their country"". A Clarence House spokesman said: ""The Prince of Wales was sad to hear of the death of Henry Allingham this morning. ""We owe him a huge debt of gratitude for all he has done."" A minute's silence was held at Lord's to mark his passing before play got under way on the third day of the second Ashes test. Mr Allingham joined the Royal Navy Air Service in September 1915 and served in Ypres before transferring to the RAF in April 1918. In November last year, he took part in ceremonies to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of WWI. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Speaking before events began, Mr Allingham said he couldn't forget the war even if he wanted to. ""I saw too many things I would like to forget but I never will forget them, I never can forget them,"" he said. For decades, he buried his war memories, avoiding reunions and refusing to discuss the events with his family. But, in 2005, he was persuaded to unveil an RAF memorial in France and decided it would have been disrespectful to his former comrades to refuse. This was followed by numerous honours and accolades. 1953 - Everest climbed for the first time He was given a doctorate in engineering from Southampton Solent University and was made an honorary freeman of Brighton and Hove. He was also made an honorary member of the Royal Naval Association, received a Legion d'Honneur and published his life story. Last month, the Royal Navy hosted a 113th birthday party on HMS President in London for his family, close friends and members of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. That was the last time his nephew Ronald Cator saw him. Mr Cator said his uncle looked ""very, very frail. He went downhill in the last few months."" ""He used to sleep a lot at the end. He wanted to pass away, poor old boy."" Dennis Goodwin, founder of the First World War Veterans' Association, led the tributes to Mr Allingham, the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland and his old friend. ""Henry was truly a gentleman - his strength of character, his purpose. He left quite a legacy to the nation of memories of what it was like to have been in WWI,"" he said. Veterans minister Kevan Jones said he was ""greatly saddened"" to hear of Mr Allingham's death. ""For one of his age, his vigour for life was extraordinary,"" he said. ""I was humbled to meet somebody who had led such an amazing life and we owe such a huge debt of gratitude to him and his generation."" Graham Mottram at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton said Mr Allingham was the ""highest example"" of a military man, who will be remembered for his ""total even-handedness"" in treating his colleagues in the forces, irrespective of age and rank. Robert Leader, chief executive of St Dunstan's care home in Ovingdean, near Brighton, said: ""He was very active right up to his final days, having recently celebrated his 113th birthday on HMS President, surrounded by family.

54,"The UK's oldest man has reached a new milestone by becoming the oldest ever British man, after clocking up 112 years and 296 days.  Henry Allingham has lived longer than Welshman John Evans, who died in 1990 aged 112 years and 295 days.  Mr Allingham is one of two surviving World War I veterans in the UK and is also the oldest Royal Navy veteran.  He is spending the day quietly at St Dunstan's care home for blind ex-service personnel near Brighton.  Mr Allingham, who has dedicated much of his time in recent years to giving talks to schoolchildren about his experiences, will be 113 years old on 6 June.  Dennis Goodwin, his close friend and founder of the First World War Veterans' Association, said: ""He has achieved another milestone in his long life and is raising the bar of longevity.  ""To be honest the last two years have been littered with milestones but this one is nice for him.  ""The next one will come when he becomes a 'teenager' again when he reaches 113 in June.""  On Monday Mr Allingham will be made an honorary member of the Royal Naval Association during a low-key presentation at St Dunstan's.  Earlier this month he received an upgraded Legion d'Honneur in London, six years after receiving his first one.  He has held the rank of chevalier, or knight, in the Legion d'Honneur since 2003 but was promoted to the rank of officer by French ambassador Maurice Gourdault-Montagne.  Mr Allingham, who now has his first great-great-great-grandchild, joined the Royal Navy Air Service in September 1915 before transferring to the RAF in April 1918.  As well as being the last founder member of the RAF, he is also the sole survivor of the Battle of Jutland."
55,"Their experiences of war may be divided by decades, but World War I veteran Henry Allingham, and L/Cpl David Hart, who has recently served in Afghanistan, are united on one point - those who gave their lives for their country must never be forgotten.  The recent deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq have shown that as annual tribute to the UK's armed forces, Remembrance Day is just as relevant today as ever.  When the guns finally fell silent to end the Great War at 11 o'clock on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, Mr Allingham had lived through the Battle of Jutland, served in what was to later become the RAF and had survived the Western Front (despite being shot in the arm).  The stench of death is sweet, he has previously said, and it stays with you always.  One night while recovering aircraft in the Ypres Salient, he fell into a ditch full of rotting rats and body parts.  Now aged 109, he has not forgotten such experiences.  Mr Allingham, who was in France on Friday to mark Armistice Day, paid tribute to his fallen comrades.  ""You can't help but recall them,"" he told the BBC. ""The pals who you saw destroyed, it wasn't very nice.""  While he has always tried to forget the horrors of the Great War, with just nine other British survivors still alive, suddenly it has become important for Mr Allingham, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, to remember.  ""By coming here, you recall things you want to forget. I do the best I can. I come here to pay homage to these brave men,"" he said in France.  ""I dare not think about things too much because I would not be able to control myself. I take a deep breath.  ""But you and I owe so much to these men who gave all they could have given on my behalf and everyone's behalf. It is so important that we acknowledge them.""  For 29-year-old L/Cpl Hart, who was seriously injured in a suicide car bombing in 2004 which killed a comrade, the reality of war is also hard to forget. His wounds are a daily reminder.  A former member of the Territorial Army, he has lost the use of his left hand and severe nerve damage has rendered most of his left arm useless.  ""Everyday things seem quite trivial now,"" he said, ""but then again it's the trivial things that can be quite stressful, like tying my shoe laces.""  The soldier, from Tiverton, Devon, was on patrol in a Land Rover in the capital Kabul when a taxi exploded.  He was blown into a nearby field and later found wandering and still on fire by locals.  To this day, his memory of the event is hazy.  This year he has been part of the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal campaign.  ""I think it is right that we remember people like myself and the friends I have lost, as well as past conflicts,"" he said.  ""All the focus is on World War I this year, but I think in this day and age we are pretty much involved in some area of conflict almost daily,"" he said.  ""And there are fundamental ways in which it's the same - we are still upholding people's freedom to live the way the wish.""  But even he says what soldiers went through in both World Wars was ""beyond comprehension"".  The kind of trauma he suffered, they suffered on an almost daily basis.  ""I think what happened to me really brought home the wide-reaching impact that something like that can have,"" he said.  ""And to remember it for one day a year is not a lot to ask of people."""
56,"Henry Allingham also took his Scout Promise when he was invested Britain's oldest man and one of the last survivors of World War I has been invested as a scout, 100 years after he first joined the movement. Henry Allingham, who celebrated his 112th birthday in June, joined the 6th Brighton Scouts as part of the group's 30th birthday celebrations. He said he was only able to spend six weeks with his local group as a boy. Mr Allingham said he had ""really enjoyed it"" and wanted to join but his mother could not afford the uniform. The war veteran was invited to join the birthday celebrations of the Sussex scout group after they heard he had missed out. He spoke to loads of the cubs and beavers... they will always remember meeting him    He was presented with a special certificate on behalf of the Chief Scout Peter Duncan by 12-year-old scout Chris Denham. ""It was great to meet Henry, it's cool that he is exactly 100 years older than I am and I feel really proud to have met him,"" the youngster said. ""He spoke to loads of the cubs and beavers... they will always remember meeting him."" Mr Allingham also took his Scout Promise when he was invested into the organisation. Simon Carter, from the Scout Association, added: ""Henry was a real inspiration to the girls and boys in the 6th Brighton. ""He is certainly the oldest living scout in the whole of Europe and probably the oldest living scout in the world. ""Henry had a sparkle in his eye when he joined in the celebrations... he told me that just being around young people and adults with so much energy and enthusiasm for life made him feel young again.""

57,"The programme, which explored the experiences and lives of its listeners, built up a dedicated following after its launch in 1998.  After Peel's death from a heart attack, guest presenters have fronted the show.  Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer said: ""John's personality was bound up in Home Truths, and now it's time to look for a different programme.""  Mr Damazer said a new programme - which would ""continue to feature the sometimes extraordinary experiences of its listeners"" - would replace Home Truths after it is dropped in the spring.  He added: ""John Peel's death last year was a terrible shock. We did not want to make a decision in haste so with the support and hard work of the highly-skilled production team and the pool of great presenters, the programme has continued.  ""I'd like to thank everyone who has worked on the programme since John's death.""  The programme was born out of a previous Peel-fronted show, Offspring, and helped introduce the veteran DJ, best known for playing ground-breaking music on Radio 1, to a new audience.  Features he dealt with included a nine-year-old boy who acted as a carer for his severely epileptic mother, to a woman talking about her enthusiasm for sniffing her pets.  Guest presenters since Peel's death have included writer David Stafford, musician Tom Robinson and comedian Linda Smith."
58,"It is not surprising that Malad, in the US state of Idaho, lays claim to having more people of Welsh descent per capita than anywhere outside of Wales.  Renewed interest in ancestry led the town to stage its first Welsh festival since World War One in early July.  Links with Carmarthen are also being made with a view to twinning the towns.  The aim is to develop the Malad Welsh Festival, which revived a once annual event, into a major cultural celebration in the American mid-west, possibly even an eisteddfod.  Lions clubs from both towns are behind the links, which it is hoped will one day lead to official twinning.  Founded in 1865, Malad was a popular destination for Mormon emigrants from Wales seeking a new life for themselves on the other side of the Atlantic.  The early pioneers would have moved west in wagon trains and handcart companies to the Malad Valley, which locals say would have been similar in look and climate to Wales.  President of the Carmarthen club, Roger Love, said ties were formed earlier this year when American Joe Thomas travelled to Wales on business and met some of the members.  He said it was fascinating that there were so many people of Welsh descent all in one small community.  ""He wanted to talk to us not just as a Lions club but as a country,"" he said.  ""The hope is that we will now twin - hopefully as a town but if not as Lions clubs.  ""The idea is to liaise back and fore - even possibly send out representatives to next year's festival.""  Jean Thomas, a member of the Malad Valley Welsh Society which organised the event, said it was a link they were keen to build on.  She said this year's two-day festival included Welsh language workshops, music, dance and talent competitions along with crafts, food and family history displays.  ""We estimated that over 800 people from all over southern Idaho and northern Utah attended,"" she said.  ""This year's success confirms out thoughts that there is a deep interest in Wales and all things Welsh, especially among us who claim a Welsh heritage.""  Malad was founded in 1865 and today has a population of just over 2,000.  Like Carmarthen, agriculture is important to the local economy.  ""The valley is surrounded by mountains, which may have reminded the early Welsh settlers of their native land,"" added Mrs Thomas.  ""I know a lot of people in Malad are anxious to visit Wales.  ""Eventually we want to award tickets to Wales as a top prize for our eisteddfod."""

The price was so high because Zeuzo possessed magical items, including the twin Warglaives of Azzinoth, owned by only a handful of Warcraft's nine million active players.  The powerful items were gained by the character's original owner completing some of the most challenging parts of the game.  World of Warcraft is an online fantasy world in which players create characters and take them adventuring. The characters gain experience and become more powerful by doing all sorts of quests (kill this, find that, deliver this).  At the higher levels many players band together to go on raids to kill the most powerful enemies and get the best loot.  Zeuzo's creator, who took the rogue from level zero to high level hero, was contacted for the BBC by other players but he would not confirm or deny reports of the sale.  The Method guild of which Zeuzo was a member also declined to comment on the the sale.  However, the BBC does have independent confirmation that the account was sold for a figure of about 7,000 euros.  Some Warcraft players who know Zeuzo's creator did speak out.  On condition of anonymity one said: ""The trade was simple. It was a case of the buyer finding out that Zeuzo was currently the best geared rogue in game.""  He said Method was disappointed to lose such a good character, but at the same time, understood the final decision.  Oliver Koppany, a fellow player chosen by Zeuzo as a ""spokesperson"" added: ""He had been undergoing financial hardship and that was the only reason why he sold the account.""  The new owner moved the valuable rogue to another server and re-named it Shaks.  Bill Vaughan, editor of IncGame's World of Warcraft website, said many people bought accounts to get over the grind of taking a character to the highest levels of the game.  ""It generally takes an average person anything up to 600 game play hours to reach the current highest level,"" said Ms Vaughan.  Account selling is a growing phenomenon and the average price currently hovers around the £200 mark.  ""The problem is,"" said Ms Vaughan, ""you have no idea how to play the character properly.""  ""Within a short space of time, you would be subject to the embarrassment of other players noticing your lack of skills, and it would be very apparent that you had either bought your account, or had paid to have your character levelled,"" she said.  But, said Ms Vaughan, worse than other players noticing someone has bought their account is catching the attention of Warcraft creator Blizzard. Selling accounts and in-game items is against the terms and conditions people sign up to when they start playing.  Blizzard has banned up to 100,000 accounts in a month for illegal gold trading or cheating in the game. In a statement the company said it took the action: ""to promote a fun and fair environment for all our players.""  ""Account sales can sometimes be hard to detect, depending on the technology that a game company uses to gather information about users,"" he added.  In this case Blizzard caught on quick. It banned the account about five days after it was sold.  While account selling is controversial among Warcraft players, for some it has become a business prospect.  ""Account selling is a ludicrous business indeed. I have friends who make good money without moving one finger,"" the BBC was told by one player. ""You can earn 200 euros without doing absolutely anything.""  He said many buy a new account for 12 euros, then pay a gold farmer to power-level the character in 20 days and then when it had reached level 70 sell it back for 400 euros.  Dee Patel, an ex-Warcraft player and a game industry professional, admitted having sold his account for £650 on eBay.  ""I could have been offered a lot more for my account but I was just wanting to stop playing and wanted to get rid of it,"" he said.  Last January, eBay banned on-line games account selling on its website. But thousands of other sites offer similar auction services.  Globally the business is huge. Edward Castronova, an academic studying the economics of online gaming at the University of Indiana, estimates that the real money trade - people paying real cash for virtual items - is worth around $300-$400m."
60,"The ""corrupted blood"" disease spread rapidly within the popular online World of Warcraft game, killing off thousands of players in an uncontrolled plague.  The experience provides essential clues to how people behave in such crises, Lancet Infectious Diseases reports.  In the game, there was a real diversity of response from the players to the threat of infection, similar to those seen in real life.  Some acted selflessly, rushing to the aid of other characters even though that meant they risked infection themselves.  Others fled infected cities in an attempt to save themselves.  And some who were sick made it their mission to deliberately infect others.  Researcher Professor Nina Fefferman, from Tufts University School of Medicine, said: ""Human behaviour has a big impact on disease spread. And virtual worlds offer an excellent platform for studying human behaviour.  ""The players seemed to really feel they were at risk and took the threat of infection seriously, even though it was only a game.""  She acknowledged that a virtual setting might encourage riskier behaviour, but said this could be estimated and allowed for when drawing conclusions.  She said a major constraint for epidemiologists studying disease dynamics at the moment was that they were limited to observational and retrospective studies.  For example, it would be unethical to release an infectious disease in real life in order to study what the consequences might be.  Computer models allow for experimentation on virtual populations without such limitations, but still rely on mathematical rules to approximate human behaviour.  A virtual world may be a way to bridge this gap, said Professor Fefferman.  Her team at Tufts are looking to use models such as the World of Warcraft to further study human behaviour, particularly in relation to disease outbreaks.  Dr Gary Smith, professor of Population Biology and Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, has been working on modelling infectious diseases.  He said: ""Very few mathematical models of disease transmission take host behaviour into account.""  But he questioned how representative of real life a virtual model could be.  ""Although the characteristics of the disease could be defined before hand, once released into the virtual world, the study is just as 'observational' as disease outbreak studies in the real world.  ""Nevertheless, I suppose one could argue that the proposal describes an opportunity for study that we might not otherwise have."""
61,"A row has erupted after Blizzard - the publishers of the popular online game World of Warcraft - announced that users on its site forums would have to post under their real names.  The firm say the move is to put an end to heated online arguments and topics started purely to cause trouble.  But users reacted angrily, citing concerns about safety and privacy.  Blizzard said they would start implementing the changes over the next few months.  A post, by Vaneras - one of the site community managers - said that the forums had become "" a place where flame wars, trolling and other unpleasantness run wild"".  ""Removing the veil of anonymity typical to online dialogue will contribute to a more positive forum environment, promote constructive conversations, and connect the Blizzard community in ways they haven't been connected before,"" the post continued.  Blizzard's new system - Real ID - means that users will have to post under their real first and last name.  The firm said it will implement the changes over the next few weeks, with the StarCraft II forums - a section dedicated to the forthcoming real time strategy game - making the switch by the end of the month. The World of Warcraft forum will change soon after.  In addition to users now posting under their own names, the site will allow others to rate post and interact with other users, creating a ""social-networking platform"".  ""As the way gamers interact with one another continues to evolve, our goal is to ensure Battle.net is equipped to handle the ever-changing social-gaming experience for years to come,"" the post by Vaneras went on.  The online community was swift to respond, with more than a thousand replies in less than 24 hours; the majority of which expressed their displeasure at the move.  ""I can't even begin to fathom why you would do this"", posted one user, while another wrote that it seems ""like someone who likes Facebook came up with it, while being blissfully unaware that an awful lot of people deliberately avoid Facebook"".  One World of Warcraft player, Jim Brand, contacted BBC News to say how disappointed he was over the change.  ""I have been using the forums for over five years, reporting bugs and trying to be helpful. Now, to have the privilege to help people on the forums I have to reveal my real name; I'm dead against it,"" he said.  ""I work in a charity and deal with governments officials. If they do a search and see I am a gamer, it could affect my employment prospects,"" he added.  Although most social networking sites have links to a person's real world name, gaming sites have always used anonymous handles.  There have been a few rare cases of online gaming disputes spilling out into the real world, and users are mostly reluctant to reveal personal details, given that video games can sometimes elicit strong emotions.  Mr Brand said that one Blizzard employee posted his real name on the forums, saying that there was no risk to users, and the experiment went drastically wrong.  ""Within five minutes, users had got hold of his telephone number, home address, photographs of him and a ton of other information,"" said Mr Brand"
62,"Egypt's president, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, has announced the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company to provide funding for the construction of the Aswan High Dam.  The British Government and French stockholders who own shares in the Suez Canal Company have reacted with shock to the news.  In a two-and-a-half hour speech delivered to a mass gathering in Alexandria, President Nasser said the Nationalisation Law had already been published in the official gazette.  He said all company assets in Egypt had been frozen and stockholders would be paid the price of their shares according to today's closing prices on the Paris Stock Exchange.  Twelve Egyptians have been appointed members of a special board which will manage the newly-nationalised company.  The Suez Canal is a key waterway for world trade and an important source of revenue for Britain.  The Suez Canal Company, which manages the waterway, is legally Egyptian but, in 1869 was granted a 99 years' concession.  It was not due to revert to the Egyptian Government until November 16, 1968.  President Nasser, who took control of Egypt following a Coup d'Etat four years ago, has been implementing a nationalisation programme in the country, and was vehement in his criticism of the West.  He said 120,000 Egyptians had died building the canal but Egypt was receiving just a tiny proportion of the company's £35m annual earnings.  President Nasser's decision to nationalise the Suez Canal company comes following Britain and America's withdrawal of financial assistance towards the Aswan Dam.  It is understood the USSR agreed last month to provide an unconditional loan towards the project."
63,"Who, what, why: Where is the hardest place in the UK to be a busker?  Police in London are using a 175-year-old law to arrest buskers, it has been reported. Which parts of the country have the most stringent restrictions on street performers?  Section 54 of the Metropolitan Police Act 1839, which also prohibits kite-flying, sleigh-riding and doorbell-ringing, was used to justify the arrest of four young musicians who had been performing in London's Leicester Square in May, the House of Lords was told.  Busking is not illegal in the UK but many council byelaws are more stringent than others when it comes to regulating the practice. In the City of London there is ""no provision for licensing busking"", according to the Corporation's website. It's ""the last place you'd go to busk"", says Jonny Walker of the Association of Street Artists and Performers.  However, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, councils can give themselves the power to seize unlicensed buskers' equipment, sell their instruments and impose fines of £1000. The only two authorities to have adopted them are Camden and Hillingdon. Arguably these penalties ""are even more draconian"", says Walker. Campaigners against the legislation in Camden said they will now take the case to the Court of Appeal.  But across the country the picture is ""incredibly mixed"", says Walker. Places like Oxford and Hull require buskers to register with the council. Southampton permits busking only in designated areas. By contrast, Bournemouth and Portsmouth have recently relaxed their licensing rules. Cathedral cities like Canterbury, Norwich and Winchester, where ""the ancient tradition of public performance is strong"", do not require any kind licence to busk. Neither does Cambridge.  There are other factors buskers have to take account of. Busking that takes place on private land requires the consent of the landowner. The Highways Act 1980 forbids buskers to obstruct roads and pavements. The Environmental Protection Act allows for noise abatement notices to be issued against nuisance buskers. Children under 14 are not permitted to busk. A street collection licence will be required if busking for charity and street trading laws regulate buskers who sell CDs and other merchandise. Under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, any street performer who gives ""any other person reasonable cause for annoyance"" is guilty of an offence north of the border.  No local authority's regulations match that of Henry VIII, who in 1530 ordered that any buskers who did not obey his licensing system be whipped for two consecutive days.

64,"Comber early potatoes have been granted protected geographical indication(PGI) status under European law.  The potatoes are prized for their distinctive earthy, nutty flavour and characteristic soft smooth skin.  The granting of PGI status means the new season Comber potato joins an elite group of high quality European products, including Parma ham, Champagne wine and Stilton cheese.  PGI status recognises the regional importance and distinctive characteristics of the Comber spud and means that only new season potatoes harvested from the fields of Comber and the surrounding area can be marketed as new season Comber earlies.  PGI legislation came into force in 1993 and provides for a system for the protection of food names on a geographical or traditional recipe basis.  The scheme highlights regional and traditional foods whose authenticity and origin can be guaranteed.  Under this system a named food or drink registered at a European level will be given legal protection against imitation throughout the EU.  In their application for the special status, the Comber growers pointed out the climate of the designated area means that the soil dries quicker, reducing the risk of frost in the winter months.  The area is dominated by Strangford Lough, the largest inlet in the British Isles. The soil surrounding the lough is red sandstone and gravel and means it is lighter and free draining.  This means that the growing season can start before other potato-growing regions in Northern Ireland and the potatoes can be harvested earlier than anywhere else.  The history of the designated area is synonymous with potato growing and is intertwined with the history of two Ulster-Scots families, the Hamiltons and the Montgomerys.  It is the area of the Hamilton lands and the Montgomery lands, including Comber, Greyabbey and Newtownards, where new season Comber potatoes are still grown.  The historical link with the original plantation venture is evident in that there are still a number of Hamiltons growing Comber potatoes."
65,"And there was a double boost for the German after his team-mate Eddie Irvine also forced his way ahead of Hakkinen's McLaren.  Irvine was second at one stage, before dropping back to fourth.  But there was disappointment for Finland's Hakkinen, who had to settle for fifth place, with fellow McLaren driver David Coulthard in sixth place.  Hakkinen will win the championship if he finishes second in Sunday's race, even if Schumacher triumphs.  Schumacher gained the early psychological advantage after five weeks of intensive build-up to the title decider.  Hakkinen led at the end of the first session, but he was just 0.074sec ahead of his German rival, who chose to spend much of the first session discussing tactics with his team.  But after the break the double champion raced to the top of the standings.  And Schumacher then bettered his time, clocking a fastest lap of one minute 39.823 seconds.  Northern Ireland's Irvine also impressed, before suffering a setback when he lost the back end of the Frerrari at a right-handed corner late in the session and slid into a gravel trap.  Jordan's Damon Hill clocked the seventh fastest time and Johnny Herbert was 18th in his Sauber in his last race before joining Stewart Ford."
66,"Schumacher recovered from a last-place starting position on the grid following a stall to power his way up to third in the final, championship-deciding grand prix of the 1998 season.  Savouring his victory, Hakkinen said: ""When Michael was forced to start from the back of the grid it raised an enormous amount of pressure from me.  ""The race was not as difficult as others I've had this season. But a lot of that's down to the team who kept letting me know where Eddie and Michael were.""  ""When Michael went to the back I knew it was up to me. I made a fantastic start and got close to Mika at some points but just couldn't manage to get in front.""  It is the first time in seven years that McLaren has won the drivers' championship.  The tension rose before the race began with a false start by Jarno Trulli in the Prost Peugeot, which sent him to the back of the line up and shortened the race by one lap.  The Ferrari had nudged forward by a couple of inches and stalled as the German put it into gear.  Schumacher acknowledged the mistake, which gave him a mountainous 20 cars to overtake, with only the tiniest shake of his head.  The final race of the 1998 season eventually got under way after being reduced from 53 to 51 laps.  The initial sparring saw the second Ferrari of Eddie Irvine race into second from third, behind Hakkinen, the leader.  But he found himself stuck behind two-time Suzuka winner Damon Hill in the Jordan, and the subsequent battle put nearly 30 seconds between the German challenger and Hakkinen before he could move up to fifth.  The Monaco-based driver, whose racing career was in doubt after an horrific crash in Australia in 1995, managed to squeeze a hand out of the cockpit to acknowledge his eighth grand prix victory of the season.  Damon Hill finished a clinical race by grabbing fourth at the final corner to give the Jordan team fourth - their highest ranking in the constructors' championship.  Williams finished a disappointing season with Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jacques Villeneuve in fifth and sixth respectively.

68,"Armenia has a population of 3.2 million but the diaspora is estimated to be some eight million. Many of them live in Russia, France, Iran and the US.  Ethnic Armenians who speak Armenian would benefit, as would foreigners married to an Armenian.  The diaspora's remittances are crucial for Armenia's economy.  Armenians backed dual citizenship in a November 2005 referendum. It abolished a clause in the constitution which barred dual nationality.  The Armenian diaspora is 2,000 years old, but its size increased dramatically after the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks from 1915 to 1917.  According to the National Bank of Armenia, remittances from the diaspora are double the size of the country's budget.  Armenia is a small landlocked country. It still has bitter disputes with its neighbours Turkey and Azerbaijan. The influence of Russia - formerly Armenia's colonial master - remains strong."
69,"Sweden is the seventh country to allow gay marriage Sweden will allow gay couples to be legally married from next month. Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to recognise same-sex marriage, becoming the fifth country in Europe to do so. Sweden was one of the first countries to give gay couples legal ""partnership"" rights, in the mid-1990s, and allowed them to adopt children from 2002. The new law lets homosexuals wed in either a civil or religious ceremony, though individual churches can opt out. The law was passed by 226 votes to 22 and will come into force on 1 May. These are the years that legislation was passed by parliament ""The decision means that gender no longer has an impact on the ability to marry and that the law on registered partnership is repealed,"" the government said on its website. Six of the seven parties in parliament backed the bill, while the Christian Democrats, one of four parties in the governing coalition, refused. The Lutheran Church, the largest church in Sweden, has offered to bless gay partnerships since January 2007, but has still not given formal backing to the term ""marriage"", and will allow individual pastors to refuse to carry out gay weddings. Sweden has become the fifth European country, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Norway, to recognise same-sex marriage. Elsewhere, Canada and South Africa have also passed such legislation, as have some US states and local authorities in other countries.     "
70,"Same-sex couples will be able to get married in England and Wales after new measures became law.  The government's controversial legislation on the issue received Royal Assent on Wednesday.  The Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat leaderships all backed the proposals, which were finally approved by MPs and peers earlier this week.  It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year.  Under the terms of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, religious organisations will have to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so.  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced the bill had received Royal Assent - the formal approval of the sovereign required for all legislation. The news was greeted with cheers in the Commons chamber.  MPs decided not to oppose a number of minor changes agreed by the House of Lords and approved the legislation on Tuesday.  There will also be a review of whether groups such as the humanists will be allowed to carry out marriages, while ministers said they were prepared to look at eliminating any difference in the treatment of gay couples when it came to pension schemes.  During the Commons debate, Equalities Minister Maria Miller said the passing of the bill was ""clear affirmation"" that ""respect for each and every person is paramount, regardless of age, religion, gender, ethnicity or sexuality"", she added.  But Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, one of the bill's opponents, said it was ""astonishing that a bill for which there is absolutely no mandate, against which a majority of Conservatives voted, has been bulldozed through both Houses"".  He added: ""I think the government should think very carefully in future if they want the support of these benches. Offending large swathes of the Conservative Party is not a good way of going about it.""  But Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said: ""It's wonderful to see same-sex marriage achieve legal recognition. Quakers see the light of God in everyone so we respect the inherent worth of each individual and each loving relationship."""
71,"A bill which allows same-sex weddings to take place in Scotland has been passed by MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.  MSPs voted by 105 to 18 in favour of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill.  The Scottish government said the move was the right thing to do but Scotland's two main churches were opposed to it.  The first gay and lesbian weddings could take place this autumn.  Religious and belief bodies can ""opt in"" to perform same-sex marriages.  Ministers said no part of the religious community would be forced to hold such ceremonies in churches.  During a debate at Holyrood, MSPs rejected amendments which were said to provide ""protection"" for groups and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage.  The SNP's John Mason tabled an amendment stating that no-one could be ""compelled by any means"" to solemnise gay marriage, including by a contract or a legal requirement.  Gay and lesbian couples are allowed to marry in sixteen countries around the world. That includes England & Wales where the first same-sex weddings are due to take place at the end of March. In Scotland, the government says it wants ceremonies to become available ""as soon as possible"". The BBC understands that it will be October - at the earliest - before this happens. By the end of 2014, Northern Ireland is expected to be the only part of the UK that does not allow same-sex marriage. Critics fear the Scottish legislation could lead to those with a traditional view of marriage facing discrimination. But the Scottish government insists that freedom of expression is fully protected. It has yet to decide whether or not to open civil partnerships to mixed sex couples.  Mr Mason said that this was similar to a measure included in the bill passed by the UK Parliament allowing same-sex marriage in England and Wales.  Health Secretary Alex Neil insisted there were ""robust protections for religious bodies and celebrants"" in the bill and the amendment was unnecessary.  Mr Mason tabled further amendments, including one calling for recognition that ""a belief in marriage as a voluntary union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others for life is a belief worthy of respect in a democratic society"".  He said: ""This has been the prevailing view in Scotland for centuries, and may now be considered a minority view or even old fashioned, but it is an integral tenet of faith for many Christians, Muslims and others as well as the belief of many of no faith position at all.""  Mr Mason added: ""We have seen volunteers in the third sector removed from the board for publicly supporting traditional marriage.""  The first same-sex weddings in England and Wales will take place from 29 March, in the wake of legislation already passed by the Westminster parliament.  In Scotland, same-sex couples currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, but SNP ministers brought forward their Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill, saying the move was an important step for equality.  MSPs were allowed a free vote, rather than along party lines.  Mr Neil said passing the bill meant ""a historic day in the history of the Scottish Parliament"", which received the front-bench backing of Labour's Jackie Baillie and Conservative Jackson Carlaw.  Gay rights organisations, including the Equality Network and Stonewall Scotland, and a range of other groups, have supported the legislation.  But the Scottish Catholic Church and Church of Scotland oppose the move, and have said they have no plans to conduct same-sex marriages.  And the campaign group Scotland for Marriage said the safeguards in the bill did not go far enough.  Quakers have campaigned in favour of same-sex marriage and have said they would allow ceremonies to take place on their premises.  Other religious groups which back change include Buddhists and the Pagan Federation.  The Church of Scotland - whose ruling General Assembly last year voted to allow actively gay men and women to become ministers - has said the institution stood against homophobia, but added that the ""wide spread of opinion"" on gay marriage was reflected among members of congregations across the country.  As well as the main bill, Scottish ministers have also reached an agreement with the UK government for an amendment to the 2010 Equality Act.  The move aims to protect individual religious celebrants, who do not wish to conduct same-sex marriages, from the threat of court action claiming discrimination.  Westminster's Marriage Act which became law last July, will allow religious organisations to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales banned in law from doing so.  The Church of England, the Church in Wales and other faith groups have stated their opposition to gay marriage.  A report commissioned by the Church of England has recommended that members of the clergy should be allowed to offer blessings to same-sex couples.  The Northern Ireland Assembly is not currently considering any legislation to allow same-sex marriage.  The Scottish government's marriage bill was brought forward after a government consultation, which produced a record 77,508 responses."
72,"Two gay men who have been a couple for 14 years have become the first to register to marry in Uruguay, hours after a law came into force allowing same-sex marriages in the country.  Rodrigo Borda, 39, and Sergio Miranda, 45, said it was a day of much joy and emotion, but also of responsibility.  President Jose Mujica signed the legislation in May, but it took 90 days to come into effect.  Uruguay is the second South American nation to pass a gay-marriage law.  Mr Borda and Mr Miranda said they would celebrate their wedding in September.  It would be a ""very public affair"", not only because they wanted to share the moment with ""all the world"", but also because they wanted ""to give an example to those gay couples who may be thinking about getting married but don't dare to"", the couple added.  Three years ago, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to allow same-sex marriages.  Since then, Brazil's Supreme Court overwhelmingly voted in favour of granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as married heterosexuals, effectively authorising gay marriage.  In Colombia, a judge recently ordered a notary to sign a document which - while not a marriage certificate - in effect gave a same-sex couple the same rights as a heterosexual one.  In Mexico, legislation on same-sex unions is a matter for individual states. Gay marriage is legal in the capital and the southern state of Quintana Roo, while the states of Coahuila and Colima allow gay couples to enter into civil unions. Gay marriage remains illegal in the rest of the country.  The gay-marriage bill is among a series of liberal reforms in Uruguay backed by President Mujica.  Since the left-wing politician came to power, parliament has also passed a law allowing abortion beyond cases of rape, incest or threats to a woman's health.  Last week, the House of Representatives voted in favour of a bill which, if passed by the Senate, will legalise marijuana and put its production and sale into the hands of the state."
73,"She is one of 80 Roma women in this pretty and quiet Czech town who claim they were coerced into sterilisation in the Czech health system.  Elegant and articulate, 37-year-old Elena describes how her stay in the maternity ward 16 years ago left her emotionally and physically scarred for life.  She had just delivered a boy and joked to the doctor: ""I won't bother to take the baby home, because I wanted a girl"".  The doctor's answer still reverberates in her ears: ""You'd better take it, because you will not have any more children. We have sterilised you.""  For years these women stayed silent, and some were even ashamed to tell their own husbands. Only a few years ago did the shocking details start to emerge.  Many were offered money, though that was not official policy. Similar cases have been reported in neighbouring Slovakia.  The practice officially ended in 1990 after the collapse of communist Czechoslovakia, but a number of doctors are said to have continued the operations on their own initiative.  The complaints sparked an official inquiry. The Czech ombudsman - Public Defender of Rights Otakar Motejl - investigated the cases and issued a report in December 2005.  ""The problem of sexual sterilisation carried out in the Czech Republic, either with improper motivation or illegally, exists,"" he said, recommending state compensation for women affected between 1973 and 1991.  During that period social services had offered some Roma women financial incentives to undergo sterilisation ""even though the state issued no instruction,"" he concluded.  The communist authorities had practised an assimilation policy towards Roma which ""included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the Romani community,"" he said.  But human rights groups say the last recorded case happened as late as 2003.  ""Sterilisation was used as a means of birth control,"" says Kumar Vishwanathan, head of Life Together, an Ostrava-based NGO for Roma rights.  Like many other Roma women, Elena Gorolova signed a consent form without realising what the operation entailed.  Some women say they had been administered drugs, others simply did not understand what the word ""sterilisation"" meant.  Czech doctors disagree. ""Sterilisation is conducted on purely medical grounds,"" says Richard Spousta, head of the gynaecological unit at an Ostrava hospital. ""We don't keep any statistics on Roma and non-Roma sterilised women. I don't know why you are making such claims.""  An investigation by a Czech health ministry advisory committee concluded that procedural mistakes had been made in a number of cases.  But the Czech embassy in London told the BBC that ""sterilisation is in no way a national policy targeted on a specific ethnic or any other group in the Czech Republic"".  ""We've suggested to the government that it issue an apology to the victims,"" says Ceslaw Walek, director of the Roma Community Affairs Council, which advises the government on Roma-related policies. ""But I cannot see this happening.""  Earlier this year the Czech high court did uphold a lower court's decision obliging an Ostrava hospital to apologise to one of the victims, Helena Ferencikova, sterilised in 2001.  ""This is the first decision of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe,"" says Lucie Fremlova from the Life Together NGO.  The hospital has not yet complied with the court's decision. Helena Ferencikova is still waiting."
74,"Three hundred soldiers are patrolling a normally tranquil village in France's Loire Valley after dozens of armed travellers clashed with police.  The riot erupted on Sunday morning in Saint-Aignan after a gendarme had shot and killed a traveller who had driven through a checkpoint, officials said.  Travellers armed with hatchets and iron bars then attacked the village police station and hacked down trees.  They also toppled traffic lights and road signs and burned three cars.  ""It was a settling of scores between the travellers and the gendarmerie,"" said the village mayor, Jean-Michel Billon.  He said the travellers also pillaged a bakery in the village. Just 3,400 people live in the village in a popular tourist region of central France.  Prosecutors quoted by the French TV channel TF1 said a traveller called Luigi had failed to stop at a police checkpoint on Friday night and had dragged a gendarme on the car bonnet for 500 metres (yards).  The gendarme escaped with only minor injuries. As the driver approached a second checkpoint he accelerated towards two gendarmes, one of whom opened fire.  The car continued on to Saint-Romain-sur-Cher, where the driver's body was later recovered, the prosecutors said.  Luigi had picked up another traveller after the first checkpoint, the TF1 report said. It is not yet clear why Luigi had tried to flee the gendarmes.  In separate rioting at the weekend, youths clashed with police in the Alpine city of Grenoble.  Four men were arrested in a dawn raid on Sunday after they allegedly fired at police during a riot early on Saturday in the suburb of Villeneuve.  The rioting was triggered by the death of 27-year-old Karim Boudouda, who was shot by police on Thursday during a chase."
75,"Hundreds of black and white youths have taken to the streets of Brixton, in south London attacking police, ransacking shops and burning cars after the death of a black man in police custody.  About 50 police officers in riot gear have formed a line across Brixton's main road to stifle pockets of trouble and prevent anyone entering the area - the scene of massive rioting in 1981 caused by racial tensions.  One report said two shots were fired as the centre of the demonstration moved into the area of the Ritzy cinema.  A police motor cyclist is reported to have been pulled from his machine by a crowd of at least 10 rioters.  Officers have sealed off a two-mile area around the centre of Brixton and both Brixton and neighbouring Stockwell tube stations have been closed.  A police helicopter has been despatched over the area.  Riots broke out after a peaceful picket of the police station - triggered by the death last week of Wayne Douglas, 26.  Police said Mr Douglas, who was being questioned about a burglary, collapsed at the local police station.  A post-mortem later revealed he had suffered from heart disease.  The protest about his death developed into a march down Brixton's main street.  A standoff ensued between the police and about 100 demonstrators triggering a backlash of violence.  Witnesses have reported hearing groups of black youths shouting ""Killers, killers"" at the police.  A spokeswoman for the police said seven civilian casualties had been reported so far, and police were also dealing with sporadic pockets of trouble in the area around Brixton town centre.  She said there had been unconfirmed reports of petrol bombs being ignited.  ""Officers were wearing protective clothing because we had reports of missiles being thrown,"" she added.  ""We gave them every opportunity to move off peacefully but they hadn't done so."""

79,"The West Bank barrier has been highly controversial ever since the Israeli government decided to build it in 2002 and it remains a bitter bone of contention after Israel's evacuation of settlements in the Gaza Strip. The BBC News website answers questions about the plan. Wall? Fence? What exactly is this structure? ""The Thing"", as one commentator has drolly called it, is in fact part-wall, part-fence. Most of its 670-kilometre (420-mile) length is made up of a concrete base with a five-metre-high wire-and-mesh superstructure. Rolls of razor wire and a four-metre-deep ditch are placed on one side. In addition, the structure is fitted with electronic sensors and has an earth-covered ""trace road"" beside it where footprints of anyone crossing can be seen. Guide to the West Bank barrier's structure and route    Parts of the structure consist of an eight-metre-high solid concrete wall, complete with massive watchtowers. The solid section around the Palestinian town of Qalqilya is conceived as a ""sniper wall"" to prevent gun attacks against Israeli motorists on the nearby Trans-Israel Highway. There are also sections of wall around Jerusalem - blocking off Ramallah and Bethlehem and running through the village of Abu Dis. Work started - at a cost of $2m a kilometre - in June 2002 and contractors have now completed about half of the planned barrier: a long segment on the north-west edge of the West Bank; two sections either side of Jerusalem; and a section in the Jordan Valley. But construction has been slowed with the Israelis announcing some changes to the route necessitated by legal rulings. On 20 February 2005 - the same day it approved the Gaza disengagement plan - Israel's cabinet approved the current planned route for the barrier, after Israel's Supreme Court ruled the previous route was needlessly disruptive to Palestinians' lives. The new route runs closer to Israel's boundary with the West Bank - the Green Line - than the original one but will still include 6-8% of occupied territory in the West Bank on the Israeli side. Why is Israel building it? The government says it is essential to prevent Palestinian would-be suicide bombers from entering Israel and attacking Israeli civilians, as has happened many times during the Palestinian intifada. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government was originally reluctant to build the barrier - which was first championed by the centre-left opposition Labour party. Right-wing ministers and their hardline supporters were not keen to build any structure which might be construed as a future Israeli-Palestinian border which left Jewish settlements stranded in Palestinian land. Pro-settlement objections have been largely assuaged by the fact that the structure is not being built on Israel's pre-1967 boundary, but snakes several kilometres into the West Bank to link settlements with Israel. What are the main objections to the plan? Israel's critics say the plan epitomises everything that is wrong with Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and its approach to making peace with its Arab neighbours. Palestinian land is confiscated to build the barrier; hundreds of Palestinian farmers and traders are cut off from their land and means of economic survival. Most significantly, it creates ""facts on the ground"" and imposes unilateral solutions which preclude negotiated agreements in the future. The impact of the plan has been felt acutely in Qalqilya, once known as the West Bank's ""fruit basket"", which lies within a tight loop in the wall. It is cut off on three sides - from the farms which supply its markets and the region's second-largest water sources. Access to the 40,000-inhabitant town passes through a single Israeli checkpoint. Why didn't Israel build the barrier along the old 1967 boundary? Palestinians say a fence around the entire West Bank might have shown the Israeli government was serious about ending the occupation - the minimum requirement for a fair resolution of the conflict as far as Palestinians are concerned. As it is, the Palestinians argue, the current plan looks suspiciously like the precursor to a structure which will hem them into discontiguous ""bantustans"" on 42% of the West Bank - something they believe Mr Sharon has been planning all along. But Israel argues that the fence is purely a security obstacle, definitely not a part of a future border. Israeli officials say there is nothing to prevent the fence from being moved after a negotiated settlement. Can legal action stand in the way of the barrier? Court challenges have been made to the barrier both internationally and in Israel itself. The International Court of Justice ruled against the barrier in July 2004, saying that it breaches international law and should be dismantled. Calling it ""tantamount to de facto annexation"", the Court said the barrier inhibited Palestinians' right to self-determination. The court's decision - which came at the request of the United Nations General Assembly - is advisory, not binding, and it has been rejected by the Israeli government. Civil rights groups have meanwhile gone to Israel's Supreme Court questioning the principle of building the barrier on occupied land and the restrictions it imposes on the Palestinians in the West Bank. This challenge has not succeeded, but more limited challenges have. In June 2004 the Court ruled that a 30-km section of barrier northwest of Jerusalem imposed undue hardship on Palestinians and must be rerouted. The Supreme Court specifically said Israel had to limit Palestinian suffering, even if that meant accepting some restrictions on its ability to defend itself. It accepted that security was the reason for building the barrier. A second ruling in September 2005 ordered reconsideration of the route around Alfei Menashe, south of Qalqilya, where several Palestinian villages have been left stranded on the western, ""Israeli"" side of the fence, devastating the local economy. On this occasion, the court also rejected the World Court ruling, saying Israel did have the right to build the barrier on occupied West Bank land, but ordering that the route be determined by the army on the basis of security needs. Washington, still keen to keep alive the roadmap peace plan, views the barrier as problematic because of its capacity to poison the atmosphere between the two sides. In an exchange of letters in April 2004, President George W Bush outlined US policy in this way: ""As the government of Israel has stated, the barrier being erected by Israel should be a security rather than political barrier, should be temporary rather than permanent and therefore not prejudice any final status issues including final borders, and its route should take into account, consistent with security needs, its impact on Palestinians not engaged in terrorist activities."" What is the UN's position on the barrier? In late September 2003, the UN issued a report which condemned the barrier as illegal and tantamount to ""an unlawful act of annexation"". In his report for the UN Commission on Human Rights, John Dugard, a South African law professor, warned that about 210,000 Palestinians living in the area between the wall and Israel would be cut off from social services, schools and places of work. ""This is likely to lead to a new generation of refugees or internally displaced people,"" he said. Israel has dismissed the UN report as ""one-sided, highly politicised and biased""."
80,"Lawyers were upset by suggestions in the film, which opens across Greece on Friday, that Alexander was bisexual.  They argue there is no historical evidence supporting claims that the Macedonian leader had male lovers.  ""Fortunately it was not what we had feared. The people can go and see the movie,"" said lawyer Giannis Varnakas.  ""There is a kiss that can be interpreted in many ways, but we have avoided the worst,"" added Mr Varnakas.  The group of 25 lawyers had claimed the film was ""not a true depiction of Alexander's life"", and wanted this made clear to cinema-goers.  They had requested a disclaimer at the start of the film warning audiences that it was not historically accurate.  However director Oliver Stone said there was a historian on set to ensure accuracy.  The lawyers' leader, Mr Varnakos, denied homophobia was the motive behind their action.  ""We would have reacted the same way if the issue didn't involve homosexuality,"" he said.  ""We just don't want a distortion of historical facts.""  The film opened in the US last week to a slew of negative reviews. It will be released in the UK on 7 January."
81,"Before every sitting of the House, the Speaker's procession leaves the Speaker's House inside the Palace of Westminster and heads for the Commons chamber.  The Serjeant at Arms, carrying the Mace, and a doorkeeper walk ahead of the Speaker. Some members of the Speaker's staff - his chaplain, secretary and a trainbearer - follow behind.  As the procession reaches the central lobby of the Houses of Parliament, one of the policemen on duty shouts: ""Hats Off Strangers!""  Then, policemen in helmets and any members of the public wearing hats are required to remove their headgear as the procession passes."
82,"A bomb has exploded at the Houses of Parliament, causing extensive damage and injuring 11 people.  The IRA said it planted the 20 lb (9.1 kg) device which exploded at about 0828 BST in a corner of Westminster Hall.  The explosion is suspected to have fractured a gas main and a fierce fire spread quickly through the centuries-old hall in one of Britain's most closely-guarded buildings.  Scotland Yard detectives have said they fear this attack could herald the start of a new summer offensive by the dissident Irish group on government buildings.  A man with an Irish accent telephoned the Press Association with a warning only six minutes before the explosion. Police said a recognised IRA codeword was given. Although officers were not able to completely clear the palace before the bomb went off, most of the injured were only slightly hurt. Leader of the Commons Edward Short announced a review of security procedures would begin immediately, but he said the attack would not disrupt parliamentary business or intimidate MPs. Liberal Chief Whip David Steel was in the building when the device detonated and told the BBC the damage looked considerable. ""I looked through Westminster Hall and the whole hall was filled with dust. A few minutes later it was possible to see flames shooting up through the windows,"" he said."
83,"Three people have died and at least 40 have been injured after an attacker drove a car along a pavement in Westminster, stabbed a policeman and was shot dead by police in the grounds of Parliament.  The dead officer was named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father.  PM Theresa May said the attack on Wednesday was ""sick and depraved"" and struck at values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.  The attacker has not been named.  Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said they think they know who he is and that he was inspired by international and Islamist-related terrorism, but gave no further details.  The attack unfolded at about 14.40 GMT on Wednesday when a single attacker drove a grey Hyundai i40 along a pavement over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament in central London, killing three people and injuring many more.  The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament.  The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed.  The attacker was shot dead by armed officers.  Mr Rowley paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: ""He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen.""  ""Heartbroken"" former colleague, Conservative MP James Cleverly, paid tribute to the ""lovely man"" he had known for 25 years. The pair had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer became a policeman.  Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood - a former Army officer whose brother died in the Bali terrorist bombing in 2002 - attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of PC Palmer.  The attacker's other victims have not been named yet. One is known to be a woman.  Mrs May said the attack was a ""sick and depraved"" attack on the heart of the capital. Such attempts to defeat UK values were ""doomed to failure"", she said.  She paid tribute to the ""exceptional men and women"" of the police force who responded to the attack, saying: ""We will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart.""  The prime minister added: ""The location of this attack was no accident.  ""The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.""  She is expected to make a statement in the Commons later.  Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, said it was important to remember that ""this was a story about people who didn't come home yesterday"".  London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""My message to those that want to harm us and destroy our way of life is: You won't succeed; you won't divide us; we won't be cowed by terrorists.""  BBC Newsnight reported there was a suggestion the car used in the attack was hired from an address in Birmingham. However, this has not been confirmed.  Armed police carried out a raid on an address in Hagley Road in the city on Wednesday night. A witness told the Press Association: ""They came and arrested three men.""  The BBC understands the Birmingham raid is linked to the London attack.  West Midlands Police referred inquires about the operation to Scotland Yard.  The carnage on Westminster Bridge and inside the grounds of Parliament is the attack that security chiefs here in the UK have long been preparing for.  Terrorism looks not just to kill and maim - but to create panic and such a sense of disorder that it rocks a city or nation to its foundations.  And this attacker sought to do so in as low-tech way as is possible.  The days when terrorism meant large, complex bombs and months of planning are gone: Western security agencies - particularly MI5 and its partner agencies - are very, very good at identifying those plots and disrupting them.  The longer it takes to plan such an attack, the more people who are involved, the more chances there will be for security services to learn what is going on.  Eyewitness Rick Longley said: ""We were just walking up to the station and there was a loud bang and a guy, someone, crashed a car and took some pedestrians out.  ""They were just laying there and then the whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben.  ""A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman.  ""I have never seen anything like that. I just can't believe what I just saw.""  One witness, Radoslaw Sikorski, a senior fellow at Harvard's Centre for European Studies, posted a video to Twitter showing people lying injured in the road on Westminster Bridge.

84,"The original dock workings which made Liverpool an international port and gave the city its name are now open to the public.  The Old Dock, located underneath the Liverpool One shopping area, was the world's first commercial enclosed wet dock, built in 1715.  This development on the mouth of the Pool saw a small village transform into a major port within 100 years.  The Old Dock opens to the public on Tuesday, 4 May, 2010.  The excavation of the area featured on Channel Four's Time Team programme in 2008.  Objects found in the dig are on display and a giant screen shows an animated view of how the view out from the dock would have looked in 1715.  Visitors can view the east section of the dock which includes a tunnel believed to have linked to Liverpool Castle.  Care was taken when building the Liverpool One complex to preserve the original dock walls.  Chris Bliss, Liverpool One's Estate Director said, ""Grosvenor has incorporated the Old Dock into the design of Liverpool One and has developed a visitor facility which will be run by National Museums Liverpool.

86,"The deal will see existing post office outlets relocated to WH Smith stores an average of 250 metres from the original site, the retailer said.  The move, which follows trials in six outlets, will boost WH Smith's annual profits by about £2.5m, the firm said.  WH Smith also reported a 7% rise in pre-tax pre-exceptional profits to £59m for the six months to 28 February.  However, profits in its High Street shops were down £2m to £51m as sales of CDs and DVDs declined.  WH Smith said that there was a ""natural fit"" between its brand and the post office which had been demonstrated by the pilot scheme.  ""Customers quickly saw the benefits of the move to WH Smith, including the convenient location in the heart of the town's shopping area, the modern and inviting post office environment, shorter queues, improved service and additional services, such as longer opening hours,"" the firm said.  Post Office Ltd Managing Director, Alan Cook, welcomed the partnership, saying it would help put the post office network ""on a sound financial footing, after many years of heavy losses"".  ""The combination of a WH Smith store and a post office branch makes perfect sense for customers and we both believe that it will strengthen our respective businesses,"" he said.  The dip in half-year results in WH Smith's High Street operation were partly due to a 36% drop in sales of in entertainment products such as CDs - as the firm moved away from that sector - and a 4% reduction in demand for stationery.  ""We remain cautious about consumer spending in our markets, however we are confident in the outcome for the full year,"" said chief executive Kate Swann.  Analyst Richard Hunter of Hargreaves Lansdowne Stockbrokers said that the Post Office tie-up would ""undoubtedly provide more foot flow"".  But he added that while cost-saving measures at the firm were going well, they masked an underlying fall in like-for-like sales in the High Street.  Like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new store space - for the half-year were down 6% across the WH Smith group. Like-for-like sales were 8% lower at the High Street stores, but the travel business saw a 4% rise.  In August last year, WH Smith demerged from its newspaper distribution business Smiths News."
87,"The Minister made her decision after the Director General of the Office of Fair Trading advised her that the deal did not present any competition concerns.  The rest of Menzies 232 stores in England and Wales will be rebranded with the Smith name.  Job losses as a result of the deal are not expected to be sizeable.  However around 100 staff at the John Menzies head office in Edinburgh have yet to learn their fate, as administration will be taken over by the chain's new parent.  A WH Smith spokesman said: ""We will be talking to them about the future and there will be a full consultation.""  He said it could be a couple of months before a final decision is taken.  He added: ""We are of course delighted by the decision, and look forward to integrating and expanding the two businesses."""
88,"The news came as WH Smith reported a 3% fall in like-for-like sales to £1.3bn ($2.3bn) in the six months to March.  Despite the fall, cost controls and a focus on more profitable sales meant half-year profits before tax and exceptional items rose 4% to £71m.  Investors welcomed the news of WH Smith's planned split, and shares in the company rose by 5%.  WH Smith said the demerger would create two ""distinct businesses"" able to pursue their own strategies.  ""An independent news distribution business will be more responsive to publisher needs and will be able to work more effectively with other retailers, because it will be free of the link to a key competitor,"" said WH Smith chief executive Kate Swann.  The company said the separation was likely to be through a demerger of the retail business, although it said no timetable had been set for the split.  Analysts said the split could create extra value for the group, and there was also talk that the distribution arm could become a bid target. WH Smith considered a sale of the distribution business in 2001.  ""The positive share price reaction is a result of investor perception that the sum of the parts is worth more than the current combined businesses,"" said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.  The fall in underlying sales comes after the group reported a similar trend over Christmas, with sales down but profits meeting expectations.  ""We have maintained our focus on group profitability,"" said chief executive Kate Swann.  She said the results came in the face of a ""challenging"" High Street environment, where it saw its retail sales fall by 6%.  ""Overall, we continue to be cautious about consumer spending,"" said Ms Swann.  ""However, we remain confident in the outcome for the full year.""  In the six weeks to 8 April, retail like-for-like sales were also down by 3%."
89,"WH Smith has taken its UK site completely offline until all abuse-themed e-books are removed from its product listings.  The move comes after last week's revelations that Amazon, WH Smith, Barnes & Noble, and other retailers were selling pornographic e-books featuring incest, rape and bestiality on their sites.  WH Smith said it was ""disgusted"" by such titles and found them ""unacceptable"".  In a statement Kobo said it was ""working quickly to review its catalogue and remove the content, authors and publishers in question"".  ""We are also evaluating new procedures to help ensure that this type of content will not become available... in the future,"" it said.  Meanwhile visitors to the WHSmith.co.uk website were greeted by a holding page statement.  The retailer said it had taken the site offline ""to best protect our customers and the public"".  ""Our website will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available"", it said.  ""We sincerely apologise for any offence caused.""  While Kobo said some publishers and authors had violated its self-publishing policies, it maintained that its goal was ""not to negatively impact the freedom of expression and the work of the amazing self-published community that has been created at Kobo.com.""  Over the weekend US retailing giant Barnes & Noble said offending titles were ""in violation"" of its policy on content offered in the NOOK Bookstore and were in the process of being removed.  ""When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy,"" it said.  Self-published e-books have grown massively in popularity along with the growth in digital e-readers and tablet computers, but retailers have been struggling to filter explicit content that breaches their website guidelines.  On Friday, technology news site The Kernel revealed how Amazon, Barnes & Noble, WH Smith, Waterstones and Foyles were listing what it called ""breathtakingly obscene"" books on their websites.  But Fiona Allen, spokeswoman for Waterstones, told the BBC: ""None of the e-books mentioned in current reporting are now or ever have been available in Waterstones shops or listed on Waterstones' website.""  She admitted that Waterstones was concerned about some print titles and was investigating those, but that all such printed book data was supplied by Nielsen, a data provider.  A spokesman for Foyles told the BBC: ""Foyles' e-book site does not take a generic feed of self-published e-books, which is where many of these problems arise, so none of the titles mentioned in these reports has ever been ordered from our website or supplied by Foyles.

I have an idea of what I want to talk about. If somebody says something or catches my eye and theyre interesting, Ill kind of like talk to them and make friends. Whatever happens there becomes one of the threads that weaves through the show. Have you ever encountered an audience that just weren't interesting? I did a gig in South Africa in a theatre in Cape Town and they were probably the most sort of reserved crowd. They just werent up for it. I think its 'cos they dont have any history of stand-up comedy and it was a bit kind of weird for them, yknow. They were just sat there going ""oh this isnt theatre."" ""Everyone I talked to just looked away, like I'd committed some sort of hideous crime."" (Real, 28K) What did you do with that audience? I sat on the side of the stage because I was on there going ""Right then, la da da..."" I was talking to this woman and she was just ignoring me and I was going ""Im talking to you."" She just wouldnt make eye contact with me. I actually stood right in front of her and said ""Im saying hello, Im not meaning you any harm,"" and she still wouldnt make contact so I went to talk to somebody else - nothing. Everyone I went to talk to just looked away, like Id committed some sort of hideous crime. So I sort of sat on the edge of the stage and talked about the fact that they were basically being a bunch of ****s and the laughter came from that. By the end of the night everyone was rolling about. You sound like a naturally friendly bloke whos interested in people. Are you like that in real life or do you go to the other extreme? I am a naturally friendly person but I have a bit of a snapping point if I think people are taking liberties. I do quite like getting into conversation with random strangers, but I also do like disappearing into my own head and I do get quite annoyed if Im just trying to daydream a bit and its interrupted. Do you get up and tell them? Does the comedian persona take over? Yes very much so. Yknow if youre sitting in a nice quite bar and somebody puts on the jukebox and then turns it up really loud? That just drives me mad. So what are we going to see from you in the future? A show called 'mind your own business and speak quietly'? I think be considerate to others would be the thing. Id quite like to fly a kite in the city centre, but I dont. Whats going to be your next move? As soon as it finishes Ive got a day off, then I go to Australia and New Zealand. Then Fiji is my next. Then Im going to be doing various gigs around the place in the summer. Im doing Regents Park and playing the outdoor gigs there - you know where they usually do the Shakspeare. Then off to the Edinburgh festival and the West End and then touring again. You did actually study performing arts didnt you. Given that your comedy is very natural and improvised, do you think its something that you can learn? No I dont think you can, youve either got it in you or you havent. That course that I did was the equivalent of an A Level, it was a 6th form college. And that was quite interesting. I realised when I did that - I went to my careers teacher and said ""I want to be a comedian"" and the teacher said ""okay then, why dont you go to college and do a performing arts course. It wasnt till I got there that I just sort of realised they were teaching all the different names for curtains, what was stage right and stage left and stuff. But in terms of it having any effect on the standup - no. You can go on a course and somebody can tell you to hold the mic like this. Somebody can tell you the way plays work and it doesnt make you a great actor. Youre either funny or youre not.    <<Back to Page 1"
91,"UK toymaker Games Workshop has been criticised for asserting a trademark claim to the phrase 'space marines'.  The claim emerged when it was used to get an American ebook about the futuristic soldiers taken off Amazon.  Science fiction writers have called the firm ""absurd"" for saying it has a trademark to the use of the term in fiction.  A UK media lawyer said more and more firms were using trademark law to protect their creations.  The row started in December 2012 when US writer Maggie Hogarth found out that her novel called ""Spots the Space Marine"" had been removed from the Amazon ebook store following a complaint from Games Workshop.  In emails sent to Ms Hogarth this week, Games Workshop claims that its entry into digital publishing gives it a ""common law trademark claim"" over the phrase.  Ms Hogarth wrote a blogpost about the row and expressed her fear that if Games Workshop started actively pursuing its claim, science fiction could lose one of its ""fundamental"" ideas. Ms Hogarth said a lack of funds meant she was unable to defend herself against the claim. However, she is now in touch with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which campaigns on digital rights, about the case.  The blogpost received a huge amount of publicity and has provoked responses from best-selling SF authors Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross and John Scalzi. Many people sent messages to Games Workshop's Twitter account using the #spacemarines hashtag criticising the firm.  Mr Scalzi, who is currently president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, said it was ""absurd"" for the firm to claim ownership of the phrase and its use in literature. In a blogpost, Mr Scalzi said it was ""pretty damn generic"" long before Games Workshop began using it to describe its toy soldiers and in tabletop games,  A spokesman for Games Workshop said it had a ""blanket policy"" of not talking to the media and had no comment to make about the row or its trademark claim.  Media and intellectual property lawyer Susan Hall from DWF said Games Workshop might struggle to assert its trademark claim in America.  ""In the US they'll come straight up against the First Amendment and that's one issue they'll have to overcome,"" she said.  Ms Hall said Games Workshop could launch a similar protection campaign in Europe as it had had a registered trademark for the term ""space marine"" since 1995. Its trademark claim covers the use of the word in connection with many aspects of tabletop gaming and video games, she said, but also extended to published works.  ""If you have a registered trademark you can stop people using it in the course of trade for goods that are not yours or licensed or approved by you,"" she said. ""It puts the person with the mark in a very strong position.""  Many firms, she said, were registering trademarks to help them keep control of intellectual properties that were now out of copyright. There were dangers in this bid for control, said Ms Hall.  ""You need strong IP laws,"" she said, ""but you need to have the ability to rub up against those in a way that allows people to be creative and allows creative freedom."""
92,"Chenjerai Hunzvi, who state media reported dead on Monday, rose to prominence as head of Zimbabwe's War Veterans Association.  The association spearheaded last year's farm invasions that raised the political temperature in Zimbabwe.  He was effectively the head of a private army fighting - often literally - for President Robert Mugabe's land reforms.  Most recently he was said to have commanded attacks on about 200 factories and businesses by militants claiming to be acting on behalf of the employees.  Mr Hunzvi's trademarks were violence and inflammatory rhetoric, and that has been useful for President Mugabe.  The war veterans' leader was sometimes referred to as Hitler, the nom-de-guerre he is said to have adopted during the war of liberation that ended with Zimbabwean independence 21 years ago.  However, it is reported that he did not actually fight in the independence war, but spent the years qualifying as a Polish-trained medical practitioner.  Mr Hunvzi compared himself to revolutionary figures like Che Guevara, and to Napolean Bonaparte and even Jesus Christ.  ""All revolutions require violence ... No-one can stop the revolution we have started,"" he once boasted.  When in prison in 1999 facing fraud charges, the courts repeatedly refused to grant Mr Hunzvi bail, saying there was a high risk that he would intimidate witnesses or abscond. His father and brothers were also arrested. The remaining war veterans' leadership voted to remove him from office.  ""They want my head because I fought successfully for the betterment of the ex-combatants,"" said Mr Hunzvi, referring to his many political enemies.  ""Jesus never wanted to be a ruler or a king, but others became jealous of his success and in the end they killed him.""  In 1997 Mr Hunzvi led his supporters in a violent campaign to secure pensions from the government in recognition of their contribution to the liberation war.  The war veterans took to the streets and, in an early indication of their contempt for the law, went so far as to stage a rowdy protest inside the High Court.  In the face of such intimidation, President Mugabe, the Patron of the War Veterans' Association, backed down, granting one-off payments of US $2,500 to the organisation's 50,000 members, as well as monthly pensions of US $100.  In a country where the minimum wage is less than US $30 a month, the payments were greeted with disbelief.  The Zimbabwe dollar crashed, driving up inflation and pushing the economy into a downward spiral from which it has yet to escape.  Mr Hunzvi and his organisation remained on the brink of political oblivion until the government's shock defeat in February last year in a referendum on a proposed new constitution.  Alarmed by the prospect of a similar result in the elections, the ruling party immediately invited the War Veterans to join its campaign strategy team.  The invasions of white-owned farms began, with thousands of protesters, many of them unemployed teenagers too young to have fought in the liberation war, organised by the War Veterans leadership.  President Mugabe and the ruling party unleashed Mr Hunzvi and his followers, partly to punish white voters for their perceived role in bringing about the government's defeat in the referendum and partly as a warning to the whole country of the potentially violent consequences of electoral defeat for Zanu-PF.  It was a high-risk strategy that seriously undermined the rule of law.  In the election, Mr Hunzvi himself was voted in as a member of parliament."
93,"The distinguished history of RAF Duxford is to be told in a new interactive exhibition.  It is the first permanent display specifically dedicated to the airfield and those stationed there.  RAF Duxford was a fighter station during World War II and is now part of the Imperial War Museum.  The new exhibition will be housed in the former Watch Office which oversaw the airfield and is planned to open in late 2012.  RAF Duxford opened as a training station towards the end of World War I.  During the following war, the airfield achieved fame as a fighter station and was the first RAF base to operate the Spitfire.  During its history, Duxford has also served as a USAAF fighter base before being taken over by the Imperial War Museum in the 1970s.  The new display, called Historic Duxford, will be housed in the old Watch Office.  In the 1930s this building was manned by the Duty Pilot who observed each day's flying activities.  Built in 1918, it will be restored to its former glory and will tell Duxford's story through the eyes of the men and women who worked at the iconic fighter station.  The exhibition will combine period reconstructions with state-of-the-art interactive displays and real objects.  Focusing on those who served on the base, hundreds of hours of memories of ex-Duxford personnel will also be available.  The exhibition's team are hoping more people with memories of the Duxford will get involved.  A meeting for community feedback is being held on Thursday, 10 March at 1900 GMT.  It will take place in the Marshall Auditorium in AirSpace at Imperial War Museum Duxford.  Have you got a story to tell about RAF Duxford? Tell us about it at cambridgeshire@bbc.co.uk"
94,"A £1bn upgrade of the British army's Warrior armoured vehicles has been announced by the government.  The move was revealed by Prime Minister David Cameron and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond on a visit to defence firm Lockheed Martin UK in Bedford.  It is hoped the move will extend the service life of the military vehicles through to 2040 and beyond.  The MoD has awarded Lockheed Martin UK a £642m contract as part of the project, securing 600 jobs.  Mr Hammond said: ""As a key step towards meeting our requirements for Future Force 2020, the upgraded Warriors will give commanders and their soldiers greater flexibility and firepower.  For the British army this announcement has been a long time coming. The planned upgrade to the ageing Warrior armoured vehicle - which first went into service in the late 1980s - had been put on hold while the Ministry of Defence tried to work out how to pay for it. Recent cuts in defence spending had jeopardised the programme. The work only got the go-ahead when the Treasury agreed this summer to a modest 1% increase in the MoD's defence equipment programme after 2015. That amounts to an extra £3bn - still not enough to cover the British military's long wish-list for new kit. Despite the Warrior upgrade the Army is still hoping to buy a new generation of specialist armoured vehicles - the Scout SV programme. Finding the money for that in this age of austerity will be much harder. The spirit of the times seems to be more ""make do and mend"".  ""Not only is this fantastic news for the Army, it also represents a great boost to British industry - sustaining jobs, skills and capability within the UK's armoured vehicle sector.""  Mr Cameron praised the role the Warrior had already played in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.  The vehicles will be fitted with a new turret and 40mm cannon, which will allow them to fire more accurately while moving.  There will also be a new armour mounting system, allowing more flexibility with different types of armour.  The head of the Army, Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall, who was also on the visit, said: ""This announcement of an upgrade to one of the Army's most important fighting vehicles is extremely welcome.  ""Warrior will continue to be at the heart of our combat capability for at least another 25 years with state-of-the-art firepower and electronics.  ""Wherever the Army deploys, our infantry will depend on its superior protection, mobility and lethality. This will be a battle winner.""  Lockheed Martin UK vice-president Alan McCormick said the decision would bring ""significant job opportunities"" for its UK suppliers.  Earlier this year, the then Defence Secretary Liam Fox told MPs the Treasury had agreed that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) could plan on the equipment and equipment support budget being increased by 1% a year in real terms between 2015-16 and 2020-21.  Mr Fox said this increase in funding meant the military could go ahead with projects including:"
95,"The former members of Lostprophets have started a new band following the conviction of frontman Ian Watkins on child sex charges last year.  Stuart Richardson, Lee Gaze, Luke Johnson, Mike Lewis and Jamie Oliver are working with former Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly.  Speaking to Radio Cardiff, Rickly said that Watkins' former bandmates deserved ""a second chance"".  He has compared No Devotion's music to The Cure and New Order.  Geoff Rickley, a US songwriter and producer, is best known for being the former lead singer of Thursday.  The 35-year-old released six studio albums with the band and has released one with his current group United Nations with a second due in 2014.  Speaking about Watkins' sexual abuse prison sentence and how it affected the other Lostprophets members, Rickly said: ""I think if ever there was a group of people that needed a second chance, it's those guys and they're going to take full advantage of it.  ""People don't really think of what happens to the other members. That took away their life.""  Rickly confirmed that he was working with the band through his label, Collect Records.  ""It's been my honour to work with them on their new band from a label perspective,"" he added.  ""People are not going to know what hit them when the new band comes out.  ""It's like everything I grew up on; a little bit of New Order, a little bit of Joy Division, little bit of The Cure. It's just so forward-thinking.""  Ian Watkins was sentenced to 35 years in prison at the end of last year for a string of child sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby.  He was given a 29-year jail sentence and will spend a further six years on licence.  Watkins, 36, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to 13 child sex offences.  His two co-defendants, who are the mothers of children he abused, were jailed for 14 and 17 years.  Earlier this year it was reported that he was seeking leave to appeal against the length of his jail term.  Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube"
96,"It is run by community groups and will serve simple Argentine food for free while all around diners eat at some of the city's most expensive restaurants.  Radical speeches were not exactly what developers had in mind when they moved in to renew the area several years ago.  Expensive restaurants and plush hotels now line the waterfront.  This, the former docks area, is where businessmen and tourists eat their lunch.  But this is also where radical activist Raul Castells has opened a community kitchen to feed, for free, the city's poor.  The site was donated by a businessman.  The small kiosk-type building opposite the Hilton Hotel is topped by a huge board with the words ""we are fighting for an Argentina in which the dogs of the rich don't eat better than the children of the poor"".  It will serve bread, stews and soups bought from donations.  Local restaurant owners are concerned but few are protesting loudly - at least not yet.  One said: ""Why here? Poor people don't live here anymore.""  But there are plenty of poor people in other parts of Buenos Aires, a short walk from Puerto Madero.  There will be no shortage of customers at the community kitchen for a hearty meal and a glimpse at how Argentina's rich live."
97,"Customs officers have carried out spot checks at petrol stations, supermarkets and car parks to catch motorists using reduced-duty fuels.  In some areas one in five tanks in vehicles stopped were found to contain red diesel, an agricultural fuel only intended for off-road farming vehicles.  Red diesel only costs about 35p a litre - about 65p less than ordinary fuels.  So far this year, more than 1,700 private cars have been found running on the illegal fuel.  Red diesel works in the same way as normal diesel but, because it is taxed at a lower rate, it is only to be used in agricultural vehicles.  It is chemically marked with a red dye to make it more identifiable.  With normal diesel prices soaring, Revenue and Customs fear that drivers using the fuel illegally are costing UK taxpayers £350m each year.  A Revenue and Customs spokeswoman said: ""Using red diesel may seem an attractive option, but the price difference is there for a reason.  ""People who use the illegal fuel are abusing the tax system. They cheat the whole country out of vital funds for public services.""  The spokeswoman explained that a scale of penalty charges is in place to punish those who use illegal fuels.  For example, she said a person who used £27 of red diesel could be charged a £500 penalty."
98,"Ask any football fan of a certain age of their memories of the 1966 World Cup and aside from the England win there is one name that often crops up.  He was not a footballer or a fan although he dressed in red, white and blue and could often be seen cheering on England.  World Cup Willie was the first World Cup mascot - a cartoon lion sporting a Union Jack football shirt and a 60s mop-top mane.  Parents buying Euro 2012 and Olympics mascot toys today can thank Willie, or his creator Reg Hoye, for kick-starting the merchandise boom that accompanies most international sporting events.  Mr Hoye was a commercial artist who illustrated some of Enid Blyton's children's books.  In the 1960s he was living in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, with his family when he was asked to design a mascot for the FA to use for the 1966 World Cup.  He came up with four designs - a boy and three different lions.  It was one of the lions, which he based on his son Leo, that became the official mascot of the tournament.  Dr Leo Francis Hoye, who now lives in Hong Kong where he is a professor of linguistics, said it was very exciting at the time to be involved in the World Cup and be given mascots and a branded tracksuit to wear when he was photographed by the media.  He said: ""It was a big moment, my father had quite a lot of success with Enid Blyton, but when World Cup Willie took off it was exciting because of all the interest.  ""There was a lot of interest from West Germany and the Soviet Union which was quite extraordinary, everyone entered into the spirit of celebrating sport without the nationalism you see today.""  The logo was to lead to more mascot work, with Mr Hoye being asked to design a polar bear character for London Zoo and a red devil for Manchester United.  But none of them eclipsed his earlier creation.  Leo said: ""Willie was used on everything from tea towels to bedspreads and mugs - all those things are very common (as merchandise) now but at the time it was very new.  ""My father was very patriotic so he was very happy about the excitement that surrounded the mascot.""  Mr Hoye died in 1987 but his World Cup mascot is still remembered today.  His son is currently writing a book about Willie's creation and his influence on sports branding around the world.  He said: ""He is not just remembered in Britain but by people of my generation from other countries.  ""I've looked through the FA's archives and there was tremendous interest from all over the world.""  And although World Cup Willie is no longer used by the FA, the image is still protected.  In 2007 the FA won a legal challenge to stop the mascot logo and name being used by a company on a range of products.  That a firm should want to use his image today is hardly surprising considering his popularity around the world.  Leo said: ""There was nothing threatening about him, which is one reason he was so popular internationally.""  And while the artist who designed him would continue to produce characters for various organisations Willie remained his favourite creation.  At the height of World Cup fever Mr Hoye drew a picture of Willie drawing his creator, which appeared in a German magazine.  Leo said: ""The German picture shows that my father had a sense of humour and very much loved his creation."""

Grampian Police confirmed that a complaint was being investigated.  Mrs McGuire said the letter arrived in a handwritten envelope.

100,"The Procurator Fiscal at Edinburgh has instructed Lothian and Borders Police to begin criminal investigations.  A Crown Office spokesman said it was not possible to speculate on the timescale for the investigation.  Mr Sheridan, who won his defamation action, dismissed the launch of the formal inquiry as ""nothing new"".  The former Scottish Socialist Party leader won his case against the News of the World newspaper in August after a four-week hearing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.  Following the verdict, the News of the World described the jury's decision as ""perverse"".  It had accused the Glasgow MSP of cheating on his wife and taking part in orgies.  Eleven fellow members of the SSP told the trial that Mr Sheridan had admitted at a party meeting in 2004 that he had visited a swingers club in Manchester.  Four of Mr Sheridan's party colleagues backed his account of that discussion, insisting he had made no such admission.  The trial and its outcome led to public acrimony within the SSP which culminated with Mr Sheridan and another MSP, Rosemary Byrne, leaving to set up a breakaway left-wing party, Solidarity.  This weekend the News of the World made public a video recording by George McNeilage, who was Mr Sheridan's best man at his wedding. The newspaper claimed this showed Mr Sheridan admitting he had attended the Manchester club.  Mr Sheridan branded the story ""a pack of lies"" and declared: ""A fictitious tape has been invented, concocted, and unleashed.""  However, Euan McColm, the Scottish political editor of the News of the World, said: ""The tape has been checked and verified by four leading voice analysts, all of whom agree that Tommy Sheridan is the man featured.  ""Tommy Sheridan's claim that the tape is faked isn't credible.""  On 22 August, the Crown Office said it had instructed the Edinburgh procurator fiscal to examine all of the evidence given in the defamation case to see if there were grounds for instructing a criminal investigation.  On Monday, a spokesman for the Crown Office said: ""On the basis of information presently available to her the procurator fiscal at Edinburgh has instructed police to begin a criminal investigation into allegations of perjury.  ""It is not possible to speculate as to any possible lines of inquiry.  ""Lothian and Borders Police will submit a report to the procurator fiscal at Edinburgh in due course.""  News Of The World Scottish editor Bob Bird said: ""We welcome the police perjury investigation into the Tommy Sheridan case and will co-operate fully with the police inquiry.""  Mr Sheridan said the Crown Office was ""only doing its job"".  ""There's nothing extraordinary in what the Crown Office has done, they are only doing their job,"" he said.  ""It is a rehashed announcement from six weeks ago, there's nothing new.""  Mr Sheridan added that he would be happy to take part in any aspect of the police investigation."
101,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Six London Underground stations were closed as trouble flared when thousands of people marked the banning of alcohol on London transport with a party. Four tube drivers, three other staff members, and two police officers were assaulted, and there were 17 arrests. Several trains were damaged and withdrawn from service, which led to suspended services. Drinkers gathered on Tube trains and station concourses for a last drink before the ban came in at midnight. Police said what should have been a fun event came to an ""unfortunate"" end. The ban on drinking from - or carrying - open containers of alcohol applies to the Tube, London buses, Docklands Light Railway and trams as of midnight on Saturday. It was announced by London Mayor Boris Johnson shortly after he took office, with the aim of making public transport safer and more pleasant. It's sweaty on there but I'm going round and round until I vomit    The party, mostly on the Circle Line, was dubbed the Last Round on the Underground or Last Orders. It had previously been widely advertised on social networking and other internet sites. The party began in a celebratory mood, with many people in good spirits and anticipating a good night. Londoner Matt Wynn, 43, a banker, said: ""I've come along with a bottle of Champagne because I want to show that you can drink responsibly on the Tube and not cause trouble."" But others took a different approach from the beginning. Peter Moore, 35, a sailor from Brighton, said he had downed a can of beer in 10 seconds. ""It's sweaty on there, but I'm going round and round until I vomit,"" he said. Transport for London's director of transport policing and enforcement, Jeroen Weimar, said the new policy on alcohol was a reasonable one. ""We are encouraging our passengers to show a bit more respect and to be more considerate and involve other people's views and other passengers views as they make their journeys,"" he said. ""And clearly drinking alcohol can create a culture whereby people feel it's ok to do that sort of thing, it's ok to get more drunk when you're travelling. ""We're not going to the stage where we're saying we're not going to carry people who've had a few drinks and who are trying to get home."" As Saturday night wore on, eyewitnesses described how drunken partygoers began fighting and vomiting, ripping up maps and adverts, spilling alcohol and leaving debris. Liverpool Street was one of six stations closed after it was mobbed British Transport Police said there was a ""large amount"" of instances of disorder reported. Liverpool Street underground station was closed to ease overcrowding for several hours. Other Tube stations closed by police were Euston, Euston Square, Aldgate, Gloucester Road and Baker Street. Seventeen people were arrested for offences such as assault, being drunk and disorderly, assaulting police, public order related offences and drug offences, BTP said. One police vehicle was damaged and two officers assaulted and another injured. Police also reported four assaults on train drivers and three assaults on other members of London Underground staff. Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) general secretary Bob Crow said: ""Boris Johnson should apologise personally to all those who were assaulted and abused last night thanks to a half-baked gimmick designed solely as a publicity stunt and without a moment's thought for the people told to implement it."" He said the RMT supported measures to reduces anti-social behaviour but that the ban was imposed in haste. ""We warned it could put our members at greater risk of assault, but there is no comfort in being proved right when Tube workers have been injured and abused,"" Mr Crow added. Police said the evening started with people keen to have fun As well as assaults, there were also ""multiple instances"" of Tube trains being damaged, which meant they were withdrawn from service, which in turn led to several Tube services being suspended. A spokesperson for the Greater London Authority said: ""Londoners are fed up of feeling threatened and intimidated on public transport. That's why the mayor has introduced an alcohol ban which came into effect today. ""It is ridiculous of the RMT to suggest that the alcohol ban threatens the safety of London Underground staff, when it was the consumption of alcohol that fuelled the reprehensible incidents of violence that took place yesterday."" The GLA said a majority of the London public welcomed the alcohol ban ""as a reasonable step that is long overdue"" and that Mr Crow was ""out of step with ordinary Londoners and the vast majority of the hard-working men and women who work for London Underground"". Superintendent Ellie Bird said she had no doubt that the event had begun with a small number of people keen to have fun without causing trouble. But she added: ""Alcohol has a significant impact on crime and anti social behaviour, not only rendering people more vulnerable but raising levels of aggression. ""Those under the influence of alcohol are more likely to cause disruption to the service through their physical state and conduct. ""We have seen numerous examples this evening of the negative impact of alcohol and antisocial behaviour. It is dangerous for those individuals and others.""     "
102,"In recent months allegations and admissions of child abuse by priests have shaken the Roman Catholic Church to its core, as a continuous stream of cases has surfaced across Western Europe and beyond. Experts say there is no evidence of a link between celibacy and abuse The Vatican has defended itself by suggesting this is a problem that affects society as a whole, and that the Church has now taken steps to deal with it - an approach that has often provoked more anger and frustration among critics who believe it systematically covered up many cases. With allegations still surfacing, there is no conclusive account of the extent of Catholic abuse worldwide or its causes. But current research and expert opinion suggest that men within the Catholic Church may be no more likely than others to abuse, and that the prevalence of abuse by priests has fallen sharply in the last 20-30 years. What has made the crisis stand out are the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way abuse was dealt with. ""The real problem is an abuse of authority, the duty of care that pastors have to their flocks,"" says the British historian, and former member of the Jesuit Catholic order, Michael Walsh. ""This has been abused and that is the greatest scandal - that's what is systemic, rather than sex abuse."" The best-known study on sex abuse by Catholic priests was published in the US, by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Commissioned by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, its main findings were published in 2004, two years after abuse cases threw the Church there into turmoil. The study established that the vast majority of known cases in the US happened decades ago, though they were only reported much more recently. There is a big gap between the reality and the public debate    Some 4% of American priests and deacons in active ministry were accused of abusing children in cases dating to the years between 1950 and 2002, the study found, with 75% of the abuses alleged to have taken place from 1960-1984. The authors of the study say they do not have data on abuse by other, comparative groups in the US - though research on the boy scouts is currently being compiled. But they stress that cases involving Catholic priests should be seen within the broader context of the widespread sexual abuse of children. ""If you think about the vast number of youth that are affected by this you have to look at this as an overall social problem of significant dimensions,"" says one of the report's researchers, Margaret Smith. In Europe, the reporting of cases has accelerated more recently, though the emerging patterns are not uniform and the picture is still patchy. In Germany, the birthplace of Pope Benedict XVI and one of the countries where the Church has come under the most pressure, abuse by priests seems to have been most widespread several decades ago - as in the US - but also relatively contained. Christian Pfeiffer, the director of the independent Criminality Research Institute of Lower Saxony and a former regional justice minister, says about 150 priests in Germany have been accused of abuse alleged to have taken place since 1990. That is about 0.1% of the 138,000 active priests in the country, he says - though he estimates that the rate of abuse was higher in earlier decades. Child abuse cases have eroded confidence among some Catholics ""We assume that three-quarters of the cases are old cases from the 50s, 60s and 70s,"" says Mr Pfeiffer, who has approached German Church authorities about doing a full study of the issue. In Ireland, where about 1,000 witnesses told the 2009 Ryan report on abuse in Catholic institutions that they had been victims of sexual abuse, that abuse is thought to have peaked at a similar time. Mr Pfeiffer says that in Germany, the attention the subject has gained has led to misconceptions about the extent of abuse. ""There is a big gap between the reality and the public debate,"" he says. ""I can understand that people are angry at the Church because it was terrible how they treated the victims, how they treated the offenders. ""But the public assumption that the German Roman Catholic Church has the same kind of problem as those in Ireland or the United States is wrong, as the quantity is much smaller."" Overall, from 2001-2010 the Vatican has considered sex abuse allegations concerning about 3,000 priests dating back up to 50 years, according to figures given last month by Monsignor Charles J Scicluna, who as the Vatican's Promoter of Justice heads the office that investigates such cases. Though the cases were spreading geographically, ""the phenomenon itself is much reduced,"" he said, noting that there are 400,000 priests worldwide. Amid intense media attention, questions have been asked - sometimes by Roman Catholics - about whether there are aspects of Catholic priestly life that encourage abuse. The vast majority of child abuse... is carried out by men who are heterosexual, and many of whom are married    Particular attention has focused on celibacy, though many experts dismiss the idea that this could be a direct cause of abuse. ""Celibacy can indeed be a challenge but the vast majority of sexual abuse is not committed by celibates,"" says Ms Smith. ""We found 4% [of priests] involved in child abuse - that means for 96% celibacy did not present a challenge in terms of child abuse."" Mr Pfeiffer says that in Germany, young priests have told him it would be possible to have sexual relationships with women if they really wanted to - lessening the risk of sexual frustration leading to abuse. But he also raises the ""hypothesis"" that paedophiles - who only represent a small minority of abuses - might ""become priests because they want to be protected against their hidden ideas"". Earlier this month Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state, rejected any relationship between abuse and celibacy, linking it instead to homosexuality. The remarks caused outrage among gay groups, and while research shows that most US victims were teenage boys, that is thought to be because this was the group to which priests had most access. ""The vast majority of child abuse [against] both male and female is carried out by men who are heterosexual, and many of whom are married,"" notes Ms Smith. She said she had been asked by a bishop whether there was a greater risk of abuse from homosexual candidates for the priesthood entering the seminary today. ""I said 'no, our research does not sustain that.'"" Whilst the John Jay has yet to publish a new report on the context and causes of abuse in the US, research to date points to a background of poor screening and training of priests, an over-reliance on psychologists, psychiatrists and lawyers, and an atmosphere of complicity in which people both inside and outside the Church often turned a blind eye to abuse. Some believe the scandals expose a crisis of authority in the Church In a letter to the Irish people published in March, the Pope placed abuse in the context of ""the rapid transformation and secularisation of society"", and mentioned a ""well-intentioned but misguided tendency to avoid penal approaches"". But the idea that secularisation fuelled abuse was challenged by Katarina Schuth, a US expert on seminaries who has worked recently in Europe. She noted that cases appear to have dropped off in the 1990s, even as the social changes continued. Ms Smith suggests social transformations did play a role in the US in that priests with ""little explicit preparation... were responding individually to some of the social influences that the 1960s and early 1970s brought to bear."" But she and Ms Schuth say steps have now been taken to improve screening and training. ""Reports often present the risk as if it were equivalent now to 1980. We don't see that in the United States,"" she says. Whatever the prevalence and causes of abuse, some are warning that the scandal will smoulder on unless institutional changes are made. Mr Walsh, the former Jesuit, says the crisis of authority that the allegations have brought about ""arises out of a culture among the clergy"" - one he thinks is reinforced by the insular nature of celibate life. ""That is why I think it's such a threat to the Church and it can only be changed by a regime change, a change at the top, because the Vatican's model is this authoritarian approach to Catholicism and the priests just pick it up.""     "
103,"The Philippines Catholic Church has apologised for sexual abuse by hundreds of its priests over the last 20 years.  The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines said on Monday that it was now drafting guidelines on how to deal with such offences by its clergy.  When sexual scandals involving Catholic priests in the US came to light earlier this year, the Philippines media began reporting on abuses by local priests.  Monday's statement was the first official response from the Church in the Philippines, where at least 85% of the 76 million-strong population is Catholic.  According to the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Orlando Quevedo, about 200 of the country's 7,000 priests may have committed ""sexual misconduct"" - including child abuse, homosexuality and affairs - over the past two decades.  ""To the various crises in society, we must now, with great sorrow and shame, add problems in the Church"", said a statement by the bishops read to a news conference on Monday.  ""Sexual misconduct on the part of shepherds of the flock betrays the holy priesthood that Christ has shared.""  A protocol is being drafted by the bishops on dealing with sexual abuse cases. The guidelines will include encouraging victims of assaults to file criminal charges, said the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference.  The Philippines is one of several Asian countries which have been wracked by sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church in the past few months.  Bishops in Australia and New Zealand have apologised to dozens of victims of sexual abuse carried out by priests and police are investigating several priests in Hong Kong for alleged indecent assault."
104,"By the BBC's Charles Rhodes Kings and queens loved them, as did prime ministers. The Humber motor car was once the favourite limousine of the aristocracy and ruling classes. After the Second World War, King George VI ordered 47 to be sent to British embassies and consulates around the world for royal tours. These days this classic car has been largely forgotten, but now a potato merchant from Hull hopes to change that with a museum dedicated to the Humber. Alan Marshall inherited his love of Humbers from his father, who drove them as army staff cars during the war. After learning to drive in a Humber, Alan now has 41, the largest collection in the world, and wants help from Kingston upon Hull City Council to open a museum dedicated to what he believes is one of Britain's greatest cars. He says: ""There seems to be a great deal of nostalgia for the Humber. There was the Great in Britain when this type of car was being made."" While around 80% of Rolls Royces have survived, the car that became know as the ""poor man's Rolls"" because it cost less than half as much as its more prestigious rival, has fared less well. Fewer than one in every 100 Humbers made it into the 21st Century. Many of the survivors have made it to the unlikely surroundings of Mr Marshall's potato warehouse in Hull. Here they are lovingly restored to former glories, made roadworthy and hired out for weddings. Alan Marshall loves them all, claiming he could sit in anyone of them blindfolded and recall its registration number. Among his favourites, a car once used by the Queen Mother to go to Church. According to Alan, who has its MoT records, the car travelled just seven miles in one year. It is fitting that Alan wants to open a museum in Hull - Thomas Humber who started the company was educated in the city. A bicycle in 1868 first carried the Humber badge, before Thomas Humber turned his attentions to cars in 1896, building limousines for those who preferred understated elegance to ostentatious displays of wealth. Edward VI and Wallis Simpson also liked the privacy afforded by a tiny back window on their Humber Snipe as it ferried them around London before his abdication in 1936. Found in a barn with its leather seats covered in Mildew and mice living under the floor, it is Alan Marshall's latest acquisition and after restoration, he promises it will take pride of place. Kingston upon Hull Council, which has spent £10m over the last decade on their museums, are less enthusiastic about the what a Humber museum could do for Hull. But with a new boss about to take over the museum department, the council has promised to offer any advice it can to Mr Marshall. And he is keeping his fingers crossed that the car nicknamed ""old faithful"" by its owners will at last be given the recognition he believes it deserves."
105,"   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the world's best-loved fairytales. As Judy Garland's famous film nears its 70th birthday, how much do its followers know about the story's use as an economic parable? Dorothy in Kansas conjures up nostalgic thoughts of childhood Christmases hiding behind the sofa from the Wicked Witch of the West. Or those flying monkeys. It's unlikely its young fans will have been thinking about deflation and monetary policy. The 1939 film is the most famous evocation of the story But the story has underlying economic and political references that make it a popular tool for teaching university and high school students - mainly in the United States but also in the UK - about the economic depression of the late 19th Century. At a time when some economists fear an onset of deflation, and economic certainties melt away like a drenched wicked witch, what can be learnt from Oz? The 1939 film starring a young Judy Garland was based on Lyman Frank Baum's book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900. It told of an orphaned Kansas girl swept by a tornado into a fantastical world, but who wants to return home to her aunt and uncle. Thinking the great Wizard of Oz can grant her wish, she sets out to meet him with her beloved dog, Toto, joined by a scarecrow, a tin woodman and a lion. Baum published the book in 1900, just after the US emerged from a period of deflation and depression. Prices had fallen by about 22% over the previous 16 years, causing huge debt. Farmers were among those badly affected, and the Populist political party was set up to represent their interests and those of industrial labourers. The US was then operating on the gold standard - a monetary system which valued the dollar according to the quantity of gold. The Populists wanted silver, along with gold, to be used for money. This would have increased the US money supply, raised price levels and reduced farmers' debt burdens. In 1964, high school teacher Henry Littlefield wrote an article outlining the notion of an underlying allegory in Baum's book. He said it offered a ""gentle and friendly"" critique of Populist thinking, and the story could be used to illuminate the late 19th Century to students. Since its publication, teachers have used this take on the tale to help classes understand the issues of the era. Wizard of Oz: US presidents of late 19th Century Wicked Witch: A malign Nature, destroyed by the farmers' most precious commodity, water. Or simply the American West Oz: An abbreviation of 'ounce' or, as Baum claimed, taken from the O-Z of a filing cabinet? And Littlefield's theory has been hotly debated. He believed the characters could represent the personalities and themes of the late 1800s,with Dorothy embodying the everyman American spirit. US political historian Quentin Taylor, who supports this interpretation, says: ""There are too many instances of parallels with the political events of the time. ""The Tin Woodman represents the industrial worker, the Scarecrow is the farmer and the Cowardly Lion is William Jennings Bryan."" Bryan was a Democratic presidential candidate who supported the silver cause. But he failed to win votes from eastern workers and lost the 1896 election. In the same way, the Lion's claws are nearly blunted by the Woodman's metallic shell. The Wicked Witch of the West is associated with a variety of controversial personalities, chief among them the industrialist Mark Hanna, campaign manager to President William McKinley. In this scenario, the yellow brick road symbolises the gold standard, the Emerald City becomes Washington DC and the Great Wizard characterises the president - and he is exposed as being less than truthful. Yet none can help Dorothy return home. Eventually she discovers that her silver shoes (changed to ruby for the film) have the power to take her back to Kansas. The allegory is still taught in schools The possible implication is that gold alone cannot be the solution for the problems facing the average citizen. But Professor Taylor thinks it's unlikely the book took sides. Instead he says it was merely explaining the story of the Populist movement, some of whom marched on Washington DC in 1894 to demand government improve their plight. Their demand for the use of silver with the gold standard was not met, although within a few years, inflation returned after discoveries of gold in South Africa and other parts of the world. In Baum's story, Dorothy loses her silver slippers in the desert before she reaches home - a possible reflection of the decline of the silver cause after 1896. But not everyone believes The Wonderful Wizard of Oz includes any hidden meanings. ""Nobody ever suggested it until 1964,"" says Bradley Hansen, who is a professor of economics at the University of Mary Washington. ""There's no solid evidence that Baum had written it as a monetary allegory,"" he adds. ""While it may have grabbed students' interests, it doesn't really teach them anything about the gold standard and, in particular, the debate about the gold standard."" Professor Hansen thinks the author was just trying to create a new kind of fairytale, the ""Harry Potter of its time"". There's no solid evidence that Baum had written it as a monetary allegory    Soon after publication, Baum adapted his book into a stage musical for adults which opened in 1902. Ranjit Dighe, who wrote The Historian's Wizard of Oz, says it poked fun at Theodore Roosevelt and the Populists, but Baum was playing for laughs, like Jay Leno. Little can be learnt from Baum about the modern economic crisis, says Professor Taylor, although in both instances people have demanded more government action. The Bank of England has - as the Populists more than 100 years ago demanded - provided a boost to the monetary supply, although the term ""quantitative easing"" was probably little known in the 1890s. And ultimately the US defeated deflation by creating money from new discoveries of gold abroad. L Frank Baum died before the debates over his true intent had started. But in the book's introduction, he stated that he was only writing to please children. He was no doubt unaware of its future appeal to economics students. Below is a selection of your comments. I never thought of TWOO as an economic parable, but it always makes me smile that poppies put you to sleep and snow wakes you up. Was that in the book or is it just Hollywood?   Carol, Manchester No real surprise - a children's story with a deeper subtext. Look just a little closer and you'll find a whole host of subtexts in children's books most noticeably the assignment of gender roles, fears about the adult world, awakening sexuality etc. I'd be interested to hear possible deeper meanings of the sequel Oz books. I'm told that the Disney film Return to Oz, which I found very disturbing as a child, is actually very close to the books - with electro convulsive therapy, and a witch who steals the heads of beautiful young girls.   Susanna, Southend-on-sea Having played the Tin Woodman in a stage version of The Wizard of Oz myself, and having taught a course in the relationships between literature and economics for years, I'm a long-time subscriber to the allegorical interpretation. Baum allegedly denied any underlying meaning, but lots of artists like to disclaim hidden agendas and let the audience do whatever the audience will do with the work. And what about the US's geographical divisions: the Bad Witches are of the East and West; the Good, from the North and South. For East read banks and railroads; for West, read gold dealers and more railroads; for North, read the heart of the Populist movement; for South, the agrarian region most harmed by the depression. Sure, Baum was just playing around...   John Stifler, Amherst, Massachusetts, US I had to smile when I read this story. People can choose to see anything they like. For decades, the gay community has had a fond regard for The Wizard of Oz, perhaps because it could be described as a bunch of misfits finding their way in the world. If you look hard enough and use a little creative licence, anybody can find anything in a movie like this. Interpretation is everything.   David Holder-Twomlow, Birmingham, UK And there I was thinking that it was just another anti-communist rant.   Stephen Shingler, Cheadle, Staffs Funny how many people seem almost offended by the idea that this fairytale is an allegory. Seems most people have forgotten what fairytales are... yes they are entertaining, but that is not their purpose. Like ancient (and modern) myths, they are an allegory first and foremost, intended to teach the (originally often ill-educated) public, both young and old, about various moral and practical aspects of their time and life in general. Whether or not the Wizard of Oz was intended as such is beside the point, if it now can function for that purpose, why not?   Alban Paul, Amsterdam The Wizard of Oz always reminds me of the great Sufi poem, The Conference of The Birds by Farid ud-Din Attar, written almost 1,000 years ago. The story of a group of birds looking to someone else to solve their problems until they get to the end of the journey and realise that, through their trials and tribulations, they found everything they were looking for within themselves. Gregory Maguire - author of Wicked and Son of A Witch - mentions that themes in his book were inspired by this poem.   Samar Habib, London I experienced the use of The Wizard of Oz as a teaching tool for both American history and economics. Whether Baum intended it or not, it does work, and it certainly helped me remember where everyone stood on the silver debate for my exams.   Barton, Minneapolis, US Perhaps the Munchkins' song was actually a clever prophecy about Sir Fred Goodwin's post-RBS lifestyle:   We get up at twelve   And start to work at one   Take an hour for lunch   And then at two we're done   Jolly good fun!   Prescient, eh?   Martin Ruck, Oxford, UK Maybe it's a warning of the future? Dorothy (citizens) keeps being told by Tin Man (industrialists with no heart), Scarecrow (banks with no brain) and Lion (politicians who have lost control of the people or animals in the jungle), that when you reach the end of the yellow brick road (finish using the gold standard) you will reach the emerald city (start using fiat money) and everything will be OK. But the Wizard was a fraud, his gifts were shallow and it was all a fantasy. Just like the money which is created by the federal banks clicking its heels together, then demanding interest or they'll send the monkeys after you.   Paul, Aberdeen Why do people have to find hidden meanings? The author himself insisted he was just writing for children, so why not leave it at that? And if no one decided about the hidden meaning until 1964, it smacks of someone trying to make a name for himself by picking on a well-known story and trying to make something else of it.    Anne Boyce, Halifax, England Can we not be allowed to enjoy a fairytale as a fairytale, loved by millions of children (and adults), without this constant need to analyse everything? It would do society a great deal of good to get a life and start to use your imaginations again and enjoy musicals for their own sake even if they do have a deep meaning. Don't we have enough doom and gloom in the world?   Jenny, London The Wizard of Oz is a simple political allegory of politicians running away from trouble when they find out and leaving trouble in the hands of the ordinary. The Wicked Witch is our blame culture, the one the politicians pin the problems on.    Elphaba, Kiamo Ko Having read the book for the first time quite recently, none of this rings true and the very specific suggested allegory requires a real stretch of the imagination. The story of an ineffective unelected leader exercising control over the populace by means of trickery and deception could certainly be regarded as an allegory during a period when the power of monarchies was being eroded in many parts of the world, but merely follows a similar universal principle to the Emperor's New Clothes and is therefore nothing new. While it is understandable that Baum would portray a politician as lacking courage, it is harder to see why he would portray farmers or industrial workers as lacking either brain or heart. Surely even a malign Nature or American West (as allegedly represented by the Wicked Witch) would be nourished by water rather than being destroyed by it? The book is nothing more than a rather pedestrian effort at a fairytale. The alleged link with the Populists seems to be the fancy of a man with too much time on his hands and an interest in a rather overlooked period of history. Marvellous film, but don't read the book to your children unless you're trying to bore them to sleep.    Iain Wishlade, Birmingham, UK Iain, you need to watch the movie again. The scarecrow turned out to be the smartest member of the band of unlikely heroes, and the tin woodsman had the most heart. And they had them all along. I am certain that the story really is allegorical. I have also heard it described as a Marxist fable, and it can fit quite nicely. Like the LOTR trilogy, or Wagner's Ring cycle, it taps into lots of ideas and themes that were floating around when the author wrote the story but it doesn't correspond exactly to any of them, and it is more than a complicated allegory, because it also stands on its own, simply as a story. That's probably why we are still reading it and watching it. For my money, it's still the best ""children's"" movie ever made, and it's nice to have a girl for a hero for a change.   Diane Jenkins, Albuquerque, NM, US I had always thought of the Wizard of Oz as a warning against advertising, as seen then in the catalogs, and the promises of their products solving life's problems. Is this its own economic parable or connected to the one stated in the article?   David DeNaples, New Haven, CT, US The remarkable art of the Wizard of Oz is its ability to appeal on several levels. It stands with the Harry Potter novels, and Mark Twain's most prominent works, in its use of a children's story to reach adults.   Frank S, Oyster Bay, NY Economic parable? Strange. I had always thought that the story was a warning against putting trust in religions, gods, magic and other supernatural things. The wiz was ""god"" (pay no attention to the man behind the curtain), the emerald city was heaven (a lie - travellers were given green sunglasses to wear on entering the city) etc.   Mysturji, Basingstoke, UK Maria, that the movie is not a faithful adaptation of the book underscores how unlikely it was that Baum was attempting to offer any allegory regarding the financial woes of the US in the early 20th Century. Certainly it can be said that authors, playwrights and screen writers can unwittingly impose some of their own beliefs into their works, I have found that it is seldom the case that there are ""hidden"" messages to be found. People will see what they want to see.   Sam Crawford, Sault Ste Marie, Canada Baum may have been influenced subconsciously by the spirit of the times. However, I think the attempt to portray The Wizard of OZ as political allegory is much more a case of interpreting things backwardly than the case of basing it on allegorical political fact. Baum wrote a good a story. Leave it at that.    Paul, Okinawa Yes, in my family we all knew - and were always astonished by how few people actually remembered the truth about this rather horrid little narrative. Certainly not actually children's fare.   Maria Ashot, London, UK The Wizard of Oz is also used to teach story-telling and screen-writing, which is more than just an incidental point. Much though the term is overused, the WoO is full of ""universal themes"", making it very easy to see parallels with other stories or situations. It's primarily a journey of discovery where the characters succeed by overcoming their own short-comings. Many stories are, so why not take the Lord of the Rings as a parable where the populist fellowship march to mount doom (Capitol Hill) in order to destroy the ""gold standard"" ring? So much sophistry.   Rob Egginton, Bristol, UK I remember fondly watching this movie in my Advance Placement US History class and afterwards discussing the meanings behind the film. Though our teacher was pleased with how well we picked up the meanings, she was equally impressed with our knowledge of how the Pink Floyd album syncs with the movie, and other titbits about the movie.   Rob Rubinstein, Chicago, IL, US Wait, wait... If you start Bernanke's 60 Minutes interview the second time the MGM Lion roars you can hear John Lennon say ""I am the goldbug"" right before Dorothy's house squishes the witch...   Noneyo, Texas Here is a little known fact about L Frank Baum and the entire Oz series. Baum never lived in Kansas. He was actually born in a small town called Chittenago, New York, which is 12 miles from where I currently live. Buam's wife was the daughter of Matilda Joslyn Gage, a prominent member of the Women's suffrage movement here in the United States. Baum himself was a prominent supporter of Women's Suffrage and it is no accident that his protagonist in the novels is female.    Joe Cooter, Syracuse, NY The next story will be about the country with a leader having a pair of tailors, and a fabulous see-thru fabric to make a new suit. All the ministers will say how wonderful he looks in the suit, which really is figure hugging, and very modern, and they offer to pay for it. Needless to say this could only be fiction from the last millennium, and not relevant to us.   Derek, Sunbury on Thames     "
106,"In school, Anas Mohammadu's mates call him ""horror"" and make fun of him.  When the 14-year-old goes to bed at night, he dreams of becoming a soldier.  ""It's only a pipedream. You don't become a soldier with weak and wobbly legs and a permanently drooling mouth,"" he says bitterly.  ""He tires too quickly. The other day, he was trying to draw water from a well and the small bucket almost pulled him into the well.""  But Anas is lucky to be alive.  Other children who were used in the controversial 1996 drug trial by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer died.  Pfizer tested the then unregistered drug in Nigeria's north-western Kano State during an outbreak of meningitis which had affected thousands of children.  Officials in Kano say more than 50 children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities.  But Pfizer says only 11 of the 200 children used in the drug trial died.  ""From our records, the fatalities were only 11, but the survival rate was 94 per cent,"" Pfizer spokesman in New York, Bryant Haskins, told the BBC News website.  Pfizer say the clinical evidence points to the deaths during the study being the direct result of meningitis and not the treatment provided during the study.  They say they always acted in the best interest of the children involved, using the best medical knowledge and practices available.  But following pressure from rights groups and families affected by the trial, the Nigerian government set up an expert medical panel to review the drug trial.  The experiment was ""an illegal trial of an unregistered drug"", the Nigerian panel concluded, and a ""clear case of exploitation of the ignorant"".  Pfizer denies any wrongdoing and reiterates its position that its trial of Trovan was conducted in accordance with Nigerian regulations.  ""These allegations against Pfizer, which are not new, are highly inflammatory and not based on all the facts,"" Mr Haskins, recently told Reuters news agency.  He also said the trial had helped save lives.  The company has previously said that ""verbal consent"" had been obtained from the parents of the children concerned and that the exercise was ""sound from medical, scientific, regulatory and ethical standpoints"".  But Mr Mustapha is still burning with anger.  ""My son was ill and we took him to the hospital like any other family would. Then the Americans and some local Nigerian doctors injected Anas with this evil drug.""  Another man, Hassan Sani, says his daughter Hajara, 14, was also given the drug.  He says the pill made his daughter deaf and unable to speak, and he wants the doctors involved to be treated as criminals.  Pfizer says these are symptoms of meningitis and there is nothing to suggest that Trovan killed or injured any children.  ""We did not suspect that our children were being used for an experiment. They have cheated us and our children. All I can say is that God will judge them according to their evil deeds.  ""Where there is a crime, there must be punishment.""  Pfizer claim that the mortality rate for a second group not using Trovan was 4% higher than those that did.  After more than a decade of silence, the Nigerian government has decided to sue Pfizer, seeking $7bn (£3.5bn) in damages for the families of children who allegedly died or suffered side-effects in the experiment.  Kano State government has also filed separate charges against Pfizer.  But Mr Sani says compensation will not be enough.  ""In addition to the compensation, they should be killed like the children they have killed,"" he says.  The Pfizer experiment was cited by many as a reason for the mass rejection of polio vaccinations in many parts of northern Nigeria in recent years.  Some local Islamic preachers said there was a western plot to sterilise Muslim women.  After several tests were carried out to proving the vaccine's safety, the programme has now been resumed.  Whether the families ever receive compensation, it will never be enough to bring back Anas's lost dreams of becoming a soldier."
107,"Halliburton's role in post-war Iraq includes operating Iraqi oil fields, new documents have revealed.  Previously, the US Army Corps of Engineers had described the contract given to Halliburton - run by US Vice President Dick Cheney between 1995 and 2000 - as putting out fires at oil wells during the conflict.  The emergency contract for firefighting and capping Iraqi oil wells was awarded to Halliburton without a bidding process in March.  Responding to questions from a US Congressman, the US Army Corps of Engineers has revealed that the contract included ""operation of facilities and distribution of products"".  In a letter to senior Democrat Henry Waxman on Friday, Army Corps Lt. Gen. Robert Flowers added the contract with Halliburton's subsidiary KBR was a ""bridge"" to one that is open to other bidders.  ""We will limit orders under this contract to those services required prior to the availability of competitively awarded contracts,"" he wrote  Halliburton said the wider role for its subsidiary KBR was announced on 24 March, when the deal was made public.  ""KBR's initial task involves hazard and operational assessment, extinguishing oil well fires, capping oil well blowouts, as well as responding to any oil spills,"" the original Halliburton statement said.  ""Following this task, KBR will perform emergency repair, as directed, to provide for the continuity of operations of the Iraqi oil infrastructure,"" it continued.  The Halliburton spokeswoman said KBR was currently assisting Iraq's oil ministry.  ""Only now, over five weeks after the contract was first disclosed, are members of Congress and the public learning that Halliburton may be asked to pump and distribute Iraqi oil under the contract,"" said senior Democrat Henry Waxman, who received the confirmation from the US Army.  Mr Waxman sits on the House of Representatives' committee on government reform.  Mr Cheney's office has repeatedly denied the vice president had a role in awarding the contract.  The US government has been criticised for its handling of the reconstruction of Iraq because only a select group of US companies have been invited to bid for the contracts.  The US Army Corps of Engineers said the Halliburton deal was a temporary measure before a contract was put out to tender in the coming months.  It expects a replacement contract to be signed by the end of August.  The US Army said in early April that Halliburton had been paid $50.3m out of the contract that could be worth up to $7bn over two years."
108,"Postcards promoting a film featuring a group of men parading naked through a south Wales housing estate have been banned by the US Postal Service.  More than 40,000 cards showing a line-up of actors from ""A Heap of Trouble"" had been printed to advertise the The World According to Shorts film festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York.  The low-budget movie - which shows a group of men walking around in just their socks and shoes - sets out to chart their struggle for emancipation in a suburban world dominated by women But the US Postal Service - which has a ban on ""lewd or filthy matter"" and sexually orientated advertisements - would only agree to mail the cards on condition a black bar was added to cover the actors' bottoms. ""With bulk mail we try to think about the few people who will have objections,"" a spokesman said. But Brooklyn Academy of Music curator Jonathan Howell, who choose the image for display at racks in restaurants and other public places, refused to comply. ""I ran the postcard past representatives of several cultural institutions and they were all okay with it,"" he said. ""We are all fairly surprised anyone could find it offensive.  ""We chose the image because it was eye-catching. It's about the middle class reaction to nudity - which is panic. ""The postcard is clearly humorous - perhaps more of a British-type of humour."" The film was co-funded by Channel 4, British Screen, Welsh film agency Sgrin and the Arts Council of Wales. Its director Cardiff-based Steve Sullivan said: ""I think it's funny that the film which has been shown all over Europe, should cause offence in the big liberal melting pot of New York. ""The general effect of censoring something is to make people see what's been censored."" The film - shot in the Pontprennau housing estate in Cardiff - received its official screening at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival back in May."
109,"   During the next few years, Engels continued his political journey. He met with Marx again in 1844. From that day a lifelong friendship and unity of purpose began. They wrote and published the ’Communist Manifesto’ together in 1848. During the summer of 1845, both Engels and Marx visited Manchester. Engels took Mary back to the continent with him and they were never separated again.     Engels returned to Manchester in November 1850. Again he came to work for the family firm. There were several reasons for this. One of which was to avoid possible arrest for his involvement in the uprisings in Germany during 1848 and 1849. Another though was in order to finance the work of Marx.     It was felt that Marx needed to devote all his time to researching and writing Das Kapital. Therefore someone would have to support him financially if he was to achieve this. Engels decided that he would have to do so. He did not do this purely out of friendship, although the bond between the two men was now very strong. He believed that Marx had the superior analytical mind and was therefore better suited to task of writing and researching what was to become Das Kapital.     Again Engels returned to the double life. On the overt side he was living as a respected businessman and leading figure of the Manchester German community. He was a member of the Albert club and Shiller-Anstalt, of which he became president in 1864, and participated in the Cheshire Hunt. He often entertained the ‘philistines’, as he described them, at his official lodgings. These society and business associates knew nothing of his great intellectual abilities. On the covert side he shared his unofficial home with Mary Burns, her sister Lizzie (Lydia) and her niece. Following Mary’s death Lizzie became Engels ‘wife’. Here he met with those who shared his communist and revolutionary convictions. He adopted secretive methods in order to keep these two lives separate.     Words: Danny Crosby                  "
110,"   Engels lived a double life in Manchester. By day he worked for his father’s firm of ‘capitalist exploiters’, while at night he became a social investigator. He met with other industrialists and businessmen and followed the lifestyle of his bourgeois station. Meanwhile he devoted his spare time to exploring the political scene and the lives of the Manchester working class.     He wrote for several socialist and radical papers during this period, both in England and continental Europe, on a variety of issues. For Robert Owen’s ‘The New Moral World’ and the Chartist papers, the ‘Northern Star’ and ’Democratic Review’, he wrote on the campaigns of the day such as the ten hours bill and others that were attempting to improve peoples working conditions. He highlighted the lessons that could be learnt from them. He also described the characteristics of socialism and other political developments on the continent. For the continental papers he wrote about the economic developments and the lessons that could be learnt from the class struggle taking place in England.     Soon after his arrival in Manchester he began a relationship with a young woman, named Mary Burns. She was to become his partner until her death twenty years later. It is not certain where they met, although it is widely believed that she was a probably an employee at the Engel’s and Ermine mill. It was Mary who introduced and guided him through the dwellings of the Manchester working class.     Words: Danny Crosby                  "
111,"Snowstorms and avalanches have killed 39 trekkers on a popular hiking route in the Himalayas, Nepali officials say.  After a fourth day of searches, 384 people have been rescued from the Annapurna trail, 216 of them foreigners, in the country's worst-ever trekking disaster.  Helicopters have been searching parts of the trail high as 5,790m (19,000ft) for survivors.  The government said the priority was to rescue 22 stranded hikers.  The trekkers are stranded at Thorung La pass, and face a shortage of food and water. Army helicopters tried to rescue them but failed after being unable to land.  The BBC's Andrew North in Nepal says that it is still unclear which climbers have been accounted for and which are still missing.  The task of the authorities is made more complicated because there are thousands of climbers in Nepal at this time of the year.  Army helicopters tried unsuccessfully to rescue them on Saturday between the Mustang and Dolpa districts, government rescue coordinator Suresh Acharya said.  Twenty bodies have been recovered but 19 bodies are still in the snow and a rescue team will be deployed on Sunday to dig them out and retrieve them by air, he said.  One of the main trekking routes - the Thorung La pass, the high point of the Annapurna Circuit - is now ""relatively safe"" after the army cleared snow, he said earlier.  Rescuers have only limited resources and most of the missing and dead are believed to be at the maximum heights that helicopters can reach.  Nepalese, Japanese, Israeli, Canadian, Indian, Slovak, Vietnamese and Polish trekkers are said to be among the dead.  Many survivors have been left with severe frostbite and will have to have limbs amputated.  Nepal earns huge revenues from the tens of thousands of trekkers and climbers who flock to the Himalayas every year.  However, it remains a very poor country and the authorities here have struggled to cope with the scale of this disaster, our correspondent says.  This has been a particularly deadly year for Nepal's trekking and mountaineering industry.  An avalanche on Mount Everest in April killed 16 Sherpa guides and resulted in a significant drop in the number of expeditions to the world's highest peak.  The latest disaster comes at the height of the trekking period."

113,"A former Gurkha soldier who won the Victoria Cross and later became the figurehead for a campaign on Gurkha's rights to settle in the UK has died.  Tul Bahadur Pun died in his home village of Myagdi, in Nepal, aged 88.  He received the Victoria Cross for saving the lives of dozens of his comrades in Burma during WWII.  In 2009 he campaigned for Gurkhas' rights alongside actress Joanna Lumley, who credited him as having saved her own soldier father's life in 1944.  Although Mr Pun was listed as 88 years old when he died it is thought his real age was 92, because birth records were inaccurate in the country at the time.  He won the military decoration after he saved the lives of his comrades by single-handedly attacking a Japanese machine-gun position in Burma in June 1944.  Martin Howe, his solicitor and joint leader of the Gurkha Justice Campaign, said Mr Pun's efforts were instrumental in bringing about a turning point in the war in the Far East, by opening the way for the allied troops to take the strategically important town of Mogaung.  Mr Pun, who served in the 3rd Battalion the 6th Gurkha Rifles, entered the public eye again after his application to settle in the UK was rejected in 2007.  He was later given the right to settle after becoming one of the figureheads of a campaign for Gurkha rights, spearheaded by Ms Lumley.  In May 2009 the campaign forced a government U-turn on a policy that had seen 36,000 Gurkhas, who retired before 1997, denied UK residency.  The rules were changed so that all Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years' service were allowed to settle in the UK.  Mr Howe, who described Mr Pun as the ""personification of integrity"", said he suffered serious illness in later life, and was virtually blind due to cataracts.  He had to be carried on a sherpa's back from his Himalayan home in order to receive medical treatment and get his monthly British Army pension.  After he was given the right to settle in the UK he lived in Chiswick, west London. But he had returned home to Nepal to see the completion of a project to build a school in his village, in which he had been involved.  Mr Pun intended to return to the UK this summer, but suffered serious respiratory problems and died unexpectedly on Wednesday night, Mr Howe said.  His funeral will be held in Nepal but a memorial service may be held at a later date in London.  Mr Howe added: ""He was not boastful or egoistic, but like so many brave Gurkhas he was a mild-mannered and considerate man.  ""He dedicated his early life to 18 years' service in the British army, and then spent his later years fighting for Gurkha rights and justice for his comrades.  ""He was passionate about education, and that children in Britain and Nepal take full advantages of the opportunities he missed out on as a young man.  ""Here was a man who at the prime of his life did everything to protect our country and defend it, and in later life was honoured to be living here and being around British people, family and friends."""
114,"Hutomo Mandala Putra, also known as Tommy, was given a 15-year sentence in 2002 following his conviction for ordering the killing of a judge.  His sentence was first cut to 10 years, and then reduced further.  Human rights activists and anti-corruption campaigners have voiced strong opposition to his release  Scuffles broke out as he was driven from the prison in east Jakarta.  His van was surrounded by dozens of reporters and photographers as he left for the prosecutor's office, where his release was made official.  Officials said Tommy Suharto was eligible for release after receiving his most recent sentence reduction along with thousands of other prisoners to mark Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.  Under Indonesian law, prisoners who have shown good conduct and have served more than two-thirds of their sentence once the remissions are taken into account are eligible for parole.  Vice President Yusuf Kalla rejected criticism that the Indonesian authorities were favouring him because of his family connections.  ""This is a state of law,"" he told reporters. ""Once he completes his sentence ... he should be released.""  Officials said he would remain on parole for a year.  A leading Indonesian human rights lawyer, Johnson Pandjaitan, said it was wrong to view the release as automatic.  ""Conditional release is never automatic. Nothing is really automatic. It should go through a certain process,"" he told Reuters news agency.  The 44-year-old former playboy was found guilty in 2002 on charges of murder, weapons possession and evading justice.  He was convicted of masterminding the assassination of Supreme Court Judge Syafiuddin Kartasasmita who was shot dead by gunmen on a motorcycle.  Judge Kartasasmita had himself convicted Tommy for corruption and illegal possession of weapons.  Tommy's father Suharto stepped down in 1998 amid an economic crisis and rising discontent.  The 84-year-old ailing former leader is accused of embezzling millions of dollars in state funds during his three decades in power, a charge he denies."
115,"A charitable foundation set up by Indonesia's late ruler Suharto has been ordered to pay $110m (£55m) following a corruption investigation.  Prosecutors said money was diverted to Suharto's family from a scholarship fund for underprivileged children.  In his ruling, civil court judge Wahyono cleared the former president of any wrongdoing but said the Supersemar foundation had broken the law.  Suharto, who died in January, ruled Indonesia between 1967 and 1998.  He was ousted by mass protests and suffered from years of poor health - one of the reasons why he never faced a corruption trial.  The Supersemar case began last year while Suharto was still alive.  The Indonesian government had claimed $440m was channelled from the foundation to Suharto's family and friends while he was in power.  But Judge Wahyono ruled that Suharto and his family were not directly responsible for the embezzlement.  ""The first defendant [Suharto] is acquitted, but the Supersemar foundation, the second defendant, has to pay some of the damages,"" he said.  ""[Supersemar] has engaged in actions that went against the law and therefore should pay.""  The judge said there had been a misuse of funds, but it was not clear how much was state finances.  So he ruled that the foundation should pay 25% of the amount the government said was stolen.  Prosecutors had also argued the government should receive more than $1bn in damages, but the judge dismissed the claim."
116,"Ms Follett said she ""deeply regrets"" the whole expenses scandal Stevenage MP Barbara Follett has been ordered to repay £42,458; the single largest amount of money following the House of Commons expenses audit. Labour Minister for the East Ms Follett claimed for security, telephone lines and artwork insurance. The 67-year-old has already repaid £32,976.17, leaving £9,482.04 which she said she has also now repaid. In October, four months after the expenses scandal broke, she said she would not stand at the next election. The House of Commons expense review, headed by Sir Thomas Legg, ordered the repayment of £34,776.30 for mobile security patrols at her second home, as well as £4,454.18, for half the cost of an ""excessive"" six telephone lines at the property. She was also overpaid £2,812.95 for a non-allowable insurance premium for fine art, received £221 twice for boiler insurance and £193.78 for pest control at an address which was not her second home. In a statement Mrs Follett said: ""I have repaid the total amount in full and am pleased that this matter has now been resolved. ""I claimed these amounts in good faith in accordance with the rules at the time. ""This has been a sad and sorry episode in Britain's political life which I deeply regret."" The MP ordered to give back the second largest amount is Conservative MP for North Essex, Bernard Jenkin, who will repay £36,909. Mr Jenkin appealed against the decision which stated he must repay £63,250, for money spent renting a property from his sister-in-law. The amount was reduced to £36,250. The former cabinet minister claimed for gardening, insect ""infestations"", removing moles and jackdaw nests from his Suffolk property, and for an annual ""rodent service"". In his report, Sir Thomas said the ""culture of deference"" in the Fees Office had left it ""vulnerable to the influence of higher authorities in the House of Commons, from the Speaker down, and of individual MPs"". He added: ""In practice, during most of the review period, these influences tended more towards looking after the immediate interests of MPs than to safeguarding propriety in public expenditure.""

117,"Benn: I come for one reason only - to see whether in a talk we can explore, or you can help me to see, what the paths to peace may be.  My only reason, I remember the war because I lost a brother. I never want to see another war.  There are millions of people all over the world who don't want a war, and by agreeing to this interview, which is very historic for all of us, I hope you will be able to help me be able to say something to the world that is significant and positive.  Saddam: Welcome to Baghdad. You are conscious of the role that Iraqis have set out for themselves, inspired by their own culture, their civilisation and their role in human history.  This role requires peace in order to prosper and progress. Having said that, the Iraqis are committed to their rights as much as they are committed to the rights of others.  Without peace they will be faced with many obstacles that would stop them from fulfilling their human role.  Benn: Mr President, may I ask you some questions. The first is, does Iraq have any weapons of mass destruction?  Saddam: Most Iraqi officials have been in power for over 34 years and have experience of dealing with the outside world.  Every fair-minded person knows that when Iraqi officials say something, they are trustworthy.  A few minutes ago when you asked me if I wanted to look at the questions beforehand I told you I didn't feel the need so that we don't waste time, and I gave you the freedom to ask me any question directly so that my reply would be direct.  This is an opportunity to reach the British people and the forces of peace in the world.  There is only one truth and therefore I tell you as I have said on many occasions before that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction whatsoever.  We challenge anyone who claims that we have to bring forward any evidence and present it to public opinion.  Benn: I have another which has been raised: Do you have links with al-Qaeda?  Saddam: If we had a relationship with al-Qaeda and we believed in that relationship we wouldn't be ashamed to admit it. Therefore I would like to tell you directly and also through you to anyone who is interested to know that we have no relationship with al-Qaeda.  Benn: In relation to the inspectors, there appears to be difficulties with inspectors, and I wonder whether there's anything you can tell me about these difficulties and whether you believe they will be cleared up before Mr Hans Blix and Mr ElBaradei come back to Baghdad?  Saddam: You are aware that every major event must encounter some difficulty.  On the subject of the inspectors and the resolutions that deal with Iraq you must have been following it and you must have a view and a vision as to whether these resolutions have any basis in international law.  Nevertheless the Security Council produced them. These resolutions - implemented or not - or the motivation behind these resolutions could lead the current situation to the path of peace or war. Therefore it's a critical situation.  Let us also remember the unjust suffering of the Iraqi people. For the last 13 years since the blockade was imposed, you must be aware of the amount of harm that it has caused the Iraqi people, particularly the children and the elderly, as a result of the shortage of food and medicine and other aspects of their life.  Therefore we are facing a critical situation.  On that basis, it is not surprising that there might be complaints relating to the small details of the inspection which may be essential issues as far as we are concerned and the way we see the whole thing. It is possible that those Iraqis who are involved with the inspection might complain about the conduct of the inspectors and they complain indeed.  It is also possible that some inspectors either for reasons of practical and detailed procedure, or for some other motives, may complain about the Iraqi conduct.  Every fair-minded person knows that as far as resolution 1441 is concerned, the Iraqis have been fulfilling their obligations under the resolution.  When Iraq objects to the conduct of those implementing the Security Council resolutions, that doesn't mean that Iraq wishes to push things to confrontation.  Iraq has no interest in war. No Iraqi official or ordinary citizen has expressed a wish to go to war.  The question should be directed at the other side. Are they looking for a pretext so they could justify war against Iraq?  If the purpose was to make sure that Iraq is free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons then they can do that. These weapons do not come in small pills that you can hide in your pocket.  These are weapons of mass destruction and it is easy to work out if Iraq has them or not. We have said many times before and we say it again today that Iraq is free of such weapons.  So when Iraq objects to the conduct of the inspection teams or others, that doesn't mean that Iraq is interested in putting obstacles before them which could hinder the efforts to get to the truth.  It is in our interest to facilitate their mission to find the truth.  The question is does the other side want to get to the same conclusion or are they looking for a pretext for aggression? If those concerned prefer aggression then it's within their reach.  The super powers can create a pretext any day to claim that Iraq is not implementing resolution 1441.  They have claimed before that Iraq did not implement the previous resolutions.  However, after many years it became clear that Iraq had complied with these resolutions. Otherwise, why are they focusing now on the latest resolution and not the previous ones?  Benn: May I broaden the question out, Mr President, to the relations between Iraq and the UN, and the prospects for peace more broadly, and I wonder whether with all its weaknesses and all the difficulties, whether you see a way in which the UN can reach that objective for the benefit of humanity?  Saddam: The point you raised can be found in the United Nations charter. As you know Iraq is one of the founders and first signatories of the charter.  If we look at the representatives of two super powers - America and Britain - and look at their conduct and their language, we would notice that they are more motivated by war than their responsibility for peace.  And when they talk about peace all they do is accuse others they wish to destroy in the name of peace.  They claim they are looking after the interests of their people. You know as well as I do that this is not the truth.  Yes the world would respect this principle if it was genuinely applied.  It's not about power but it is about right and wrong, about when we base our human relations on good, and respect this principle.  So it becomes simple to adhere to this principle because anyone who violates it will be exposed to public opinion.  Benn: There are people who believe this present conflict is about oil, and I wonder if you would say something about how you see the enormous oil reserves of Iraq being developed, first for the benefit of the people of Iraq and secondly for the needs of mankind.  Saddam: When we speak about oil in this part of the world - we are an integral part of the world - we have to deal with others in all aspects of life, economic as well as social, technical, scientific and other areas.  It seems that the authorities in the US are motivated by aggression that has been evident for more than a decade against the region.  The first factor is the role of those influential people in the decision taken by the president of the US based on sympathy with the Zionist entity that was created at the expense of Palestine and its people and their humanity.  These people force the hand of the American administration by claiming that the Arabs pose a danger to Israel, without remembering their obligation to God and how the Palestinian people were driven out of their homeland.  The consecutive American administrations were led down a path of hostility against the people of this region, including our own nation and we are part of it.  Those people and others have been telling the various US administrations, especially the current one, that if you want to control the world you need to control the oil.  Therefore the destruction of Iraq is a pre-requisite to controlling oil. That means the destruction of the Iraqi national identity, since the Iraqis are committed to their principles and rights according to international law and the UN charter.  It seems that this argument has appealed to some US administrations especially the current one that if they control the oil in the Middle East, they would be able to control the world. They could dictate to China the size of its economic growth and interfere in its education system and could do the same to Germany and France and perhaps to Russia and Japan.  They might even tell the same to Britain if its oil doesn't satisfy its domestic consumption.  It seems to me that this hostility is a trademark of the current US administration and is based on its wish to control the world and spread its hegemony.  People have the right to say that if this aggression by the American administration continues, it would lead to widespread enmity and resistance.  We won't be able to develop the oil fields or the oil industry and therefore create worldwide co-operation as members of the human family when there is war, destruction and death.  Isn't it reasonable to question this approach and conclude that this road will not benefit anyone including America or its people?  It may serve some short-term interests or the interests of some influential powers in the US but we can't claim that it serves the interest of the American people in the long run or other nations.  Benn: There are tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people in Britain and America, in Europe and worldwide, who want to see a peaceful outcome to this problem, and they are the real Americans in my opinion, the real British, the real French, the real Germans, because they think of the world in terms of their children.  I have 10 grandchildren and in my family there is English, Scottish, American, French, Irish, Jewish, Indian, Muslim blood, and for me politics is about their future, their survival.  And I wonder whether you could say something yourself directly through this interview to the peace movement of the world that might help to advance the cause they have in mind?  Saddam: First of all we admire the development of the peace movement around the world in the last few years.  We pray to God to empower all those working against war and for the cause of peace and security based on just peace for all.  And through you we say to the British people that Iraqis do not hate the British people.  Before 1991 Iraq and Britain had a normal relationship as well as normal relations with America.  At that time the British governments had no reason to criticise Iraq as we hear some voices doing these days.  We hope the British people would tell those who hate the Iraqis and wish them harm that there is no reason to justify this war and please tell them that I say to you because the British people are brave - tell them that the Iraqis are brave too.  Tell the British people if the Iraqis are subjected to aggression or humiliation they would fight bravely.  Just as the British people did in the Second World War and we will defend our country as they defended their country each in its own way.  The Iraqis don't wish war but if war is imposed upon them - if they are attacked and insulted - they will defend themselves. They will defend their country, their sovereignty and their security.  We will not disappoint those who believe in the principles of justice.  And we will uphold the principles of justice and right that we strongly believe in."
118,"Demonstrators were protesting against government policies in the Middle East and nuclear weapons, on the eve of the Labour Party conference in the city.  The theme was ""Time To Go"" - a call to get troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan.  Police estimated 20,000 people took part. Stop The War Coalition had said it expected about 100,000.  One of the organisers, Yasmin Ataullah of the British Muslim Initiative, told the BBC they put the figures of demonstrators at 40,000 or higher.  ""This is one of the biggest mobilisations outside London and I think there are tens of thousands here - 40 or 50,000 at least,"" she said.  The march began in Albert Square outside the city's town hall, before heading down Lower Mosley Street, Deansgate, Market Street, Cross Street and back to Albert Square for a rally.  Some protesters lay down in the road as part of a ""die-in"" to symbolise the number of casualties in Iraq.  Andrew Murray, chairman of the Stop The War Coalition, which helped organise the event, said: ""The tens of thousands of people marching through Manchester represent the opinion of the majority of people in this country.""  They held up banners which read ""time to go"" and ""bring troops home"".  A peace camp was set up at the nearby Peace Gardens earlier this week by families of serving troops.  There were also speeches against replacing the Trident nuclear weapons system.  The march is the 15th national demonstration organised by the Stop The War Coalition, CND and the Muslim Association of Britain, and is said to be the biggest of its kind ever held in Manchester.  Speakers included veteran peace activist Tony Benn, union leaders Tony Woodley of the T&G, and Keith Sonnet of Unison, Rose Gentle of Military Families Against the War, and Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan.  About 1,250 police were on duty during the march and rally.  Supt John O'Hare, public order commander at Greater Manchester Police, said: ""We estimate that up to 20,000 protestors came to Manchester to take part in the 'Stop the War' march.  ""On behalf of GMP I would like to extend my thanks to the organisers and those who took part in today's protest, for co-operating with us and behaving peacefully and lawfully.""  A security cordon is in place in part of the city around the G-Mex Centre and the nearby conference centre for the start of the Labour conference on Sunday."
119,"His political career has spanned half a century, but it started here in Bristol back in 1950, when Tony Benn became the Labour MP for Bristol South East .  When he took up his seat in 1951, Tony Benn became the youngest MP, or ""Baby of the House"".  But Tony Benn was the son of an hereditary peer. His father had been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942.  Tony Benn had an older brother Michael who had no objections to inheriting a peerage, but Michael was later killed in the Second World War, and this left Tony Benn as the heir to a peerage.  He made several attempts to remove himself from the line of succession but they were all unsuccessful.  Still insisting on his right to abandon his unwelcome peerage, Tony Benn fought to retain his seat in the by-election on 4 May 1961 caused by his succession.  Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, the people of Bristol South East re-elected him.  An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Tony Benn was disqualified, and gave the seat to the Conservative runner up in the by-election, Malcolm St Clair, ironically also the son of a peer.  Outside Parliament Tony Benn continued his campaign, and eventually the Conservative government accepted the need for a change in the law.  The Peerage Act 1963, allowing renunciation of peerages,  became law shortly after 6 pm on 31 July 1963.  Tony Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, at 6.22 pm that day.  Malcolm St. Clair had already given an undertaking that he would respect the wishes of the people of Bristol if Tony Benn became eligible to take his seat again, and therefore he resigned his seat immediately.  He then went on to become the MP for Chesterfield.  Tony Benn in the 1950s was an MP with middle-of-the-road or soft left views, who refused to become a member of the group around Nye Bevan.  In the 1960s government of Harold Wilson he became Postmaster General. He later became Minister of Technology where he was responsible for overseeing the development of Concorde.  In the Labour government of 1974 Tony Benn became Secretary of State for Industry, but in 1975 he was moved to Secretary of State for Energy.  By the end of the 1970s Tony Benn had migrated to the left-wing of the Labour Party. He attributed this political shift to his experience as a minister in the 1964-1970 Labour government.  In 1981 he stood for election against the incumbent Denis Healey as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, and Denis Healey emerged victorious by a margin of barely 1%.  He stood for election as Party Leader in 1988 and was defeated again, on this occasion by a substantial margin.  In 2001 he retired from Parliament, but remains involved in politics and is a prolific diary writer.  In a list compiled by the magazine New Statesman in 2006, he was voted twelfth in the list of ""Heroes of our time""  In October 2007, at the age of 82, Tony Benn announced that he wanted to come out of retirement and return to the House of Commons."

""He is happy that everything has been resolved so quickly. The problem has been one of dialogue from the moment last weekend's game with Racing ended.""  Eto'o had apparently slammed Rijkaard for saying he refused to play as a substitute.  ""Telling a news conference I didn't want to play is the behaviour of a bad person,"" Eto'o said.  ""I have always thought about the group first. That is what hurt me most.""  Eto'o, a three-time African Player of the Year, has only just returned from a four-month absence following a serious right knee injury.  He explained that he refused to play in the 2-0 win over Racing Santander even though he turned out the previous weekend in the 0-0 draw against Osasuna because he did not have time to warm up properly.  Ronaldinho was also critical of Eto'o after the game, suggesting the striker had been inconsiderate to his team-mates.  But Eto'o responded: ""If a team-mate says that you must think of the team, it's up to him to think of the team. Personally I always think first about the group and then money.""  However, on Wednesday Eto'o sought to quell tensions raised by his public criticism.  During a training session there appeared to be no hard feelings between Eto'o and Ronaldinho as the two players were photographed hugging.  Earlier, Eto'o denied calling Rijkaard ""a bad person"" saying: ""It's a lie to say I called Rijkaard a bad person. Those who love controversy want to say that,"" he said.  ""I didn't explode, I responded to what was being said about me,"" he added.  Reports had suggested a rift had developed at the Catalan club between supporters of president Joan Laporta and those of former vice-president Sandro Rosell, who left the club after a disagreement with Laporta."
121,"Tito Vilanova has stepped down as Barcelona manager to continue his treatment for cancer.  The 44-year-old had a tumour removed from his throat in November 2011 before suffering a relapse last year.  Vilanova had surgery in December 2012 and spent 10 weeks in New York to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy before returning in March to see his side  The club said that a new manager is expected to be announced next week.  Barcelona president Sandro Rosell and director of football Andoni Zubizarreta announced the news at a brief media conference attended by the first-team squad.  Rossell said: ""Tito Vilanova will continue treatment of his illness, he will not be able to continue as Barcelona's head manager.  ""This is a very difficult blow to the club, but we have overcome many difficult setbacks.""  Barca forward Lionel Messi has offered his support to Vilanova, writing on his Facebook page: ""Strength Tito! We are all with you in this fight!""  The Argentinian's club-mate Andres Iniesta added in the Spanish newspaper AS: ""Tito will once again win this terrible battle facing him. On behalf of the players and everyone, I send him all my love and support. At the end of the day, this is about a person, not a coach.""  Barca's friendly with Polish club Lechia Gdansk on Saturday night has been cancelled.  Vilanova replaced Pep Guardiola as manager in June 2012, having previously worked as his assistant.  Reports in Spain suggest Joan Francesc Ferrer, known as Rubi, could replace Vilanova in a caretaker capacity.  He joined Barca's coaching staff last month as an assistant to Vilanova and Jordi Roura, who took charge of the first team when Vilanova was absent last season.  Rubi was head coach of Girona last term and led the club to the Segunda Division play-offs, where they lost to Almeria."
122,"A millionaire businessman who sold fake bomb detectors to countries including Iraq and Georgia, knowing they did not work, has been convicted of fraud.  James McCormick, 56, of Langport, Somerset, is said to have made £50m from sales and sold more than 6,000 in Iraq, the Old Bailey heard.  Police said the devices, modelled on a novelty golf ball finder, are still in use at some checkpoints.  One Iraqi bomb victim described him to the BBC as a ""morally bankrupt"" man.  During Tuesday's hearing at the Old Bailey in London, the court was told McCormick's detectors, which cost up to $40,000 (£27,000) each, were completely ineffectual and lacked any grounding in science.  Richard Whittam QC, for the prosecution, said: ""The devices did not work and he knew they did not work.""  McCormick had claimed the devices could bypass ""all forms of concealment"", detecting drugs and people along with explosives, the court heard.  He claimed they would work under water and from the air, and would track an object up to 1km (3280ft) below the ground.  The bomb detectors came with cards which were ""programmed"" to detect a wide array of substances, from ivory to $100 banknotes.  Other substances could be detected, it was claimed, if put in a jar with a sticker which would absorb its ""vapours"" and was then stuck on a card that would be read by the machine.  In reality, McCormick's device was based on $20 (£13) golf ball finders which he had purchased from the US and which had no working electronics.  Police said McCormick showed a complete disregard for the safety of those who used and relied upon the device for their own security and protection.  The court heard there was no evidence that McCormick had tried to sell the products to the Ministry of Defence.  BBC Two's Newsnight programme conducted an investigation into the devices sold by McCormick's company, resulting in a UK government ban on their sale in Iraq and Afghanistan in January 2010.  It found that senior Iraqi officials knew the devices did not work and it alleged some had received bribes to ensure they were purchased.  Iraq spent more than $40m (£26.2m) on 6,000 devices between 2008 and 2010, the programme said.  General Jihad al-Jabiri, the head of the Baghdad bomb squad, is currently serving a jail term for corruption, along with two other Iraqi officials.  One senior Iraqi official told the BBC that the useless devices had created a false sense of security - and that no punishment would make up for the blood that had been shed as a result.  BBC Newsnight also spoke to Haneen Alwan, an Iraqi woman who needed 59 operations after she was injured in a bomb blast in January 2009. She was two months pregnant at the time and lost her child.  She told the programme: ""When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they thought they would be safe, but they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience. He is morally bankrupt. How could he sell them just for money and destroy other people's lives?""  Meanwhile, Avon and Somerset Constabulary's Det Insp Ed Heath told the BBC the devices had been used at numerous checkpoints in Iraq.  He said: ""It is clear that both civilians and armed forces personnel were put at significant risk in relying upon this equipment.  ""McCormick showed a complete disregard for the safety of those that used and relied upon the device for their own security and protection. He amassed many millions of pounds through his greed and criminal enterprise.""  The force's Det Supt Nigel Rock described McCormick as a ""conman"", adding: ""We have heard evidence from many, many experts, scientists, leaders in their field, who have said this was a fraud. A sham.  ""That device has been used and is still being used on checkpoints. People using that device believe it works. It does not.""  McCormick was remanded on conditional bail to be sentenced on 2 May.

123,"A Spanish court has sentenced the former leader of the banned Basque separatist party Batasuna to two years in jail for ""glorifying terrorism"".  Arnaldo Otegi was charged over a speech he gave in 2005 in which he compared a jailed Eta member to South African Nobel laureate Nelson Mandela.  Batasuna is the political wing of the militant Basque separatist group Eta.  Eta is blamed for more than 820 deaths in its campaign for an independent Basque state.  Arnaldo Otegi has also been banned from holding public office for 16 years.  He is already in jail on charges of trying to re-form Batasuna. He also faces another case related to Batasuna's alleged financing of Eta and its activities."
124,"The former Labour prime minister also said he must carry the can for the ""winter of discontent"".  Lord Callaghan was in office from 1976 until he was defeated at the 1979 General Election by Baroness Thatcher.  Speaking in an interview with The Oldie magazine, Lord Callaghan said he would not be surprised if he was considered the worst prime minister since Sir Robert Walpole, who was in office between 1721 and 1742.  He said: ""I think we are all re-evaluated as time goes by and I should not be the slightest bit surprised if there is another evaluation after I die and people come to the conclusion that I was the worst prime minister since Walpole.""  Lord Callaghan, now 87, also said he would have taken more ""initiatives"" than he did during the ""winter of discontent"" of widespread trade union action in 1978-79.  He conceded he had been ""insensitive"", especially over his comments which led to the famous headline in The Sun: ""Crisis? What crisis?""  Lord Callaghan never actually uttered those words, but the phrase nevertheless went down in history as his response to a reporter on returning from a summit in sunny Guadeloupe at the heart of the crisis.  The reporter had asked: ""What of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?""  'It was my fault'  The then prime minister replied: ""I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.""  But in his latest interview Lord Callaghan, now 87, said: ""It was my fault in the sense that I was the leader of the country.  ""I was the prime minister and we had got ourselves into a position that was really disgraceful. It was probably a combination of weak leadership among the trade unions and insensitivity on my part, but I must carry the can.  ""I very much regret it. Even at my present age if I were to go back and be prime minister now I would certainly take more initiatives than I did then."""
125,"The new Race Relations Act has come into force, making it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services to people because of their ethnic background.  The Act has extended the powers of the Race Relations Board to deal with complaints of discrimination; and set up a new body, the Community Relations Commission, to promote ""harmonious community relations"".  Presenting the Bill to Parliament, the Home Secretary, Jim Callaghan, said, ""The House has rarely faced an issue of greater social significance for our country and our children.""  One of the most controversial areas of the Act has been the exclusion of government services, such as the police, from legal proceedings.  Opposition MP Quintin Hogg said it was unfair to treat private employers more strictly than public employers.  ""Why should the ordinary subject be liable to an action for damages, as the Home Secretary has decided that he should be, but the Home Secretary get off scot free?"" he asked the Commons.  Race has become a major issue following the speech in April of the right-wing Conservative MP, Enoch Powell, against immigration into Britain from Commonwealth countries.  He spoke of a ""river of blood"" should immigration continue, and his remarks caused outrage among MPs.  Mr Powell was sacked from the shadow cabinet soon afterwards for his racist views, but the government was taken aback to find some sections of the media applauding the speech.  Thousands of workers staged strikes in protest and marched to Downing Street in support.  Mr Powell's speech came after the sudden influx of Kenyan Asians into the country, driven out of Kenya by draconian laws denying them employment.  At the beginning of the year, up to 1,000 Kenyan Asians, who hold British passports, were arriving in Britain each month.  Amid growing unrest, the government rushed through the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in March, restricting the number of Kenyan Asians who could enter the country to those who had a relative who was already a British resident.  The new Race Relations Act is intended to counter-balance the Immigration Act, and so fulfil the government's promise to be ""fair but tough"" on immigrants."
126,"Coldplay have shot straight to the top of the UK albums chart - despite their record having been on sale for just three days. The band's fourth album, Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends, has sold 302,000 copies since Thursday. It has become one of the fastest-selling records in history. Meanwhile, dance act Mint Royale remains at the top of the singles chart with Singin' In The Rain, which was featured on ITV's Britain's Got Talent. R&B singer Rihanna stayed at number two with Take A Bow, followed by Ne-Yo with Closer. 1. Coldplay - Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends 5. The Fratellis- Here We Stand The highest-placed new entry in the singles chart was Feeder's We Are The People, which charted at number 25. The new release from Coldplay - whose last album, X&Y, has sold 10 million copies since 2005 - had been hotly-anticipated. In May, the band's website collapsed after Violet Hill - the first single from the album - was made available for seven days as a free download on the band's website. Gennaro Castaldo, of music retailer HMV, said: ""Coldplay have sold as many albums in three days as most big artists sell in three months. ""They have the broadest appeal of any band around in terms of combined record store, online and download sales, and are already certs to have the biggest release of 2008.""

127,"Iain Balshaw and Phil Christophers both departed within 25 minutes but tries from Chris Bell and Andre Snyman helped the Tykes to a 20-9 half-time lead.  Gordon Ross added two penalties, while Bath fly-half Chris Malone kicked four.  Despite Bath dominating territory and possession in the second half, Leeds held on for their first major trophy.  The Tykes defended brilliantly as the match wore on and Bath's error count mounted as the clock ticked down.  Bath now have to pick themselves up to try to qualify for the Premiership play-offs, while Leeds will be in next year's Heineken Cup if they preserve their top-flight status.  But they did not let that early setback affect them despite Malone putting Bath ahead with the first of three first-half penalties.  Man-of-the-match Ross punished Bath indiscretions at the breakdown with two long-range efforts from just inside the Bath half in the 12th and 18th minutes.  The Tykes lost a second England international after 25 minutes when Christophers was forced off after a kick to his ribs from his own scrum-half, Alan Dickens, at a ruck.  The impressive Ross glided through a gaping hole in the Bath midfield and chipped over the remaining cover where Bell claimed the ball and forced his way over.  Ross converted for a 13-3 lead, but two more Malone penalties hauled Bath to within striking distance as the interval beckoned.  But the Australian fly-half then suffered a horror moment when his speculative long pass was intercepted by Snyman on his own 22.  When Malone landed his fourth penalty five minutes after the resumption, the stage appeared set for a Bath fightback.  But another effort hit an upright after 50 minutes and despite plenty of possession generated by their pack, Bath's backs looked clueless as to how to turn it into points.  A botched overlap with 17 minutes left was typical of their lack of craft, and when Malone pushed a penalty wide with 10 minutes left, Leeds sensed it would be their day.  Despite not scoring a point in the second half, they held on with some desperate defence.  Number eight Alix Popham brilliantly stole possession close to his own line and Snyman knocked back Matt Perry with an all-enveloping tackle.  Referee Dave Pearson's final whistle sparked wild celebrations in the Tykes' ranks, and utter despair in Bath's."
128,"      Towards the end of the Victorian era, Dundee was famous for its three Js - Jute, Jam and Journalism.       Factsheet Jute   In the 18th century the city was already an established centre of textile production, mainly in linen, and made huge quantities of sail cloth for Europe. By the 1830s, jute was produced to supplement linen production and gradually took over until the city became known as Juteopolis. The rapid rise in the industry was matched by the growth in population: Dundee expanded fourfold in the 19th century and 50,000 people were employed in the mills and factories at its height. Jute production declined in the 1920s mainly due to fierce competition from the Indian jute industry. The Dundee industry is now completely gone and the city has suffered badly as a result.      The Verdant Works is a restored 19th century jute mill and a living history    museum preserving Dundees long association with the Jute Trade. Find out    about the beginnings of the jute trade in India, experience the harsh    conditions workers were subjected to in the mills through film shows and    interactive computers, and discover why the industry fell into decline.      Jam   The story goes that it was a Dundee woman, Janet Keillor, who discovered    marmalade in the late 1700s. She came upon the recipe through trying to    find a use for bitter Seville oranges. Her recipe was developed by her son,    James Keillor, who opened Keillors factory, famous the world over for    producing jams and marmalades.      Journalism   DC Thomson, publishers of The Beano, The Dandy, The Sunday Post and the Peoples Friend, was established in 1905 and still employs around 2000 people to this day. The home of Dennis the Menace and the Bash Street Kids is the Courier Building, headquarters of DC Thomson on the west side of Albert Square.      Albert Square itself has the grandest Albert Memorial outside London, built by the citys merchants and industrialists in 1867. Beside the memorial is the McManus Galleries, the citys main museum and Art Gallery.      Dundee was also a major centre of the whaling industry in Victorian times and whale oil was used in jute production to soften the jute fibres before weaving. This became less viable by the late 19th century when excessive hunting exhausted the Arctic's whale stocks. Dundee's expertise in constructing whaling ships that could withstand extreme weather conditions led to it becoming the 'City of Discovery'. In 1899 the National Antarctic Expedition Committee commissioned the Dundee Shipbuilding Company to construct an adapted whaler: the Royal Research Ship, Discovery. In March 1901 the ship was launched, taking Captain Scott on his first voyage to the Antarctic. The ship is still in Dundee today at Discovery Point, where the story is told of Captain Scott's polar expeditions, including the ill-fated attempt of 1910.      The other landmark which dominates the city of Dundee is her bridge over the Tay. The Tay Rail Bridge was opened in 1878 and was the longest bridge in the world on completion at over two miles long. It was a mammoth undertaking and cost a massive £300,000 to build. However, in December of the same year, the centre of the bridge collapsed during a storm while a train was crossing - 75 people were killed. An enquiry found the bridge had serious design faults. Incredibly, girders from the collapsed bridge were salvaged and used in the construction of a new railway bridge, which was completed in 1887. You can still see the piers of the original bridge beside its replacement today.   "
129,"The cost of inquiries into Princess Diana's death is nearing £7m There is ""not a shred of evidence"" that the Duke of Edinburgh ordered Princess Diana's death or that it was organised by MI6, the inquest has heard. Coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker said jurors could find that Diana and Dodi Al Fayed died accidentally, or because of negligence. Many conspiracy theories suggested by Dodi's father Mohamed about the deaths were without foundation, he insisted. The couple died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. Speaking to the jury after six months of evidence, the coroner said many of Mohamed Al Fayed's theories about the crash were ""so demonstrably without foundation"" that even his lawyer was no longer pursuing them. He put aside theories which, he said, had been encouraged by the media for the past 10 years, as he began to go through evidence from more than 250 witnesses. Mohamed Al Fayed was in court to hear the coroner He said of Mr Al Fayed's ideas: ""They are not being pursued because there is not a shred of evidence to support them. ""Foremost among them is the proposition that Diana was assassinated by the secret intelligence service (MI6) on the orders of the Duke of Edinburgh. ""There is no evidence that the Duke of Edinburgh ordered Diana's execution, and there is no evidence that the secret intelligence service or any other Government agency organised it."" He said the lengthy and costly inquest had played a crucial role in testing those theories - but that some people would continue to believe in the murder theory no matter what the verdict was. Of the alleged murder he said: ""There are no doubt those who genuinely believe this to be the case and will continue to do so regardless of any verdict you return. ""You have heard the evidence and it is your decision that matters and not anyone else's. ""You will have been reassured to have heard that Mohamed Al Fayed told you on oath that he will accept your verdict; no doubt the other interested persons will do likewise."" He said that he and the jury - plus one Diana fan who sat through all the proceedings with the words ""Diana"" and ""Dodi"" painted on his face - were the only ones to hear every word of evidence. Lord Baker gave the jury five verdict options, and added: ""I have determined that it is not open to you to find that this was unlawful killing by the Duke of Edinburgh or anyone else in a staged accident."" The five options included unlawful killing by grossly negligent driving of the paparazzi in the following vehicles; unlawful killing through the gross negligence of the driver Henri Paul; and unlawful killing by the grossly negligent driving of both the following vehicles and Mr Paul. A verdict of accidental death could be returned if none of the previous verdicts are established. The jury was also given the option of an open verdict. Lord Baker said it was regrettable that there had been some witnesses ""who it appears have told lies in the witness box or elsewhere"", naming former butler Paul Burrell as one of those who were ""liars by their own admission"". Mr Burrell appeared at the inquest for three days in January, but in a video recording obtained by the Sun newspaper he apparently claimed he introduced ""red herrings"" during his evidence and held back facts. He then refused to re-appear at the inquest to explain discrepancies between his evidence and comments reported in the newspaper. At the time, the coroner said he could not compel him to give evidence because Mr Burrell lives outside the court's jurisdiction in the US."
130,"Almost 100 councils are known to have deposited money in Icelandic banks Local authorities have not been ""reckless"" in investing more than £840m with Icelandic banks that have now failed, the government has said. Deposits from more than 100 councils could be at risk, the BBC has learned. Ministers have promised ""case-by-case"" help in England and Wales, but say in Scotland the issue will be dealt with by the Holyrood administration. Gordon Brown said he was considering ""further action"", but the government is not offering to guarantee the deposits. The prime minister told the BBC that the Icelandic authorities' handling of accounts had been ""effectively illegal"" and ""completely unacceptable"". The government has frozen the UK assets of Icelandic bank Landsbanki, saying local authorities will benefit from this. They have failed not only the people of Iceland; they have failed people in Britain    But Iceland's prime minister, Geir Haarde, said it was ""not very pleasant"" to have laws designed to deal with terrorists used against his country. So far local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland have revealed that they have deposits worth £842.5m in total. The figure is £946.8m when investments by police authorities and Transport for London are added. Treasury Ministers Stephen Timms and Ian Pearson and Local Government Minister John Healy held talks with the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales. In a joint statement afterwards they said: ""Government and the LGA agreed that there is no evidence of recklessness by local authorities."" They added: ""We will judge what's appropriate on a case-by-case basis but, in previous situations, support has included helping local authorities restructure their financial priorities, providing additional expertise and capitalisation of expenditure."" James Purnell, the Minister for Work and Pensions, said the government's priority was to make sure that the services provided by local authorities were not affected by the collapse. ""We met with the Local Government Association and have been discussing this with councils, and we've agreed that we want to work together obviously to protect service levels - but this is a complicated situation. ""We've agreed that we will work with them over the next few days, and that is the right way of doing it, making sure we get a proper answer."" A Treasury spokesman said any assistance for Scottish councils would come from Holyrood, as local authority matters are devolved. According to Britain-wide figures acquired by the BBC, Kent County Council has the largest deposit, worth £50m. Nottingham City Council has invested £42m, while Transport for London has £40m deposited in one of the affected banks. The Conservatives have warned that town halls could face a ""massive financial shock"" and be forced into council tax hikes or cuts in local services. ""They are not going to find it easy in the short term,"" shadow communities secretary Eric Pickles said. He added: ""We need to look at the number of authorities that will be facing a cash-flow problem - some have their payroll on this, for others it's in terms of long-term investment."" The Lib Dems said the money at stake was ""essential"" for delivering local services and urged ministers to ""make clear"" how such funding would be protected. But councils say they have followed Treasury advice by investing surplus money to deliver the highest return for taxpayers. The LGA insisted all those involved had enough money to ensure frontline services should not be affected. But it wants the same protection for councils as has been given to personal customers of IceSave and other failed Icelandic banks.     "
131,"By Susannah Price in Karachi Pakistan's welfare system is in a state of collapse. People no longer look to the government for help, but to one extraordinary individual, Abdul Sattar Edhi. Mr Edhi, who is 72, is known as Pakistan's answer to Mother Teresa of Pakistan in recognition of his work for the poor and needy.    We have one basic principle ... to be there as soon as we are needed    He runs the largest social welfare network in Pakistan, funded entirely by voluntary donations. It includes a fleet of 500 ambulances as well as homes for children, the mentally ill and drug addicts. Mr Edhi says: ""We have one basic principle and that is to be there as soon as we are needed to help people and humanity."" The wail of ambulance sirens on Karachi's dangerous roads is a familiar sound and each day sees countless traffic accidents, violent murders and sudden illnesses. There is no emergency transport at the public hospitals for the city's 12 million residents. The only ambulances, along with two planes and a helicopter, are run by the Edhi Foundation. Edhi ambulances are known for being first on the scene of an accident, despite Karachi's appalling traffic. After an emergency call to the call tower we were taken to a terrible sight - the body of a newborn baby who was left next to a cattle shed to die. His parents abandoned him and the state would do nothing. The neighbours called the Edhi workers, knowing the boy would receive a proper burial. The man behind the whole extraordinary operation has a small office in the centre of Pakistan's largest city, Karachi. Mr Edhi says his mother inspired him to start his social work by encouraging him to spend only half his pocket money on himself. He says the plight of Pakistan's unwanted children has always been one of his main concerns. Amina, another newborn bab, was left in one of the cradles Edhi has placed outside all his centres. He wants mothers to leave their children there instead of killing them or leaving them to die. He explains there are many reasons mothers become so desperate. ""One is poverty, illegitimacy is another and the third is that some families do not like girls."" Hundreds of boys who were abandoned by their parents live in a sprawling compound outside Karachi called Edhi village, where they eat, sleep and have their lessons. Mr Edhi enjoys his visits here to quiz the children on their classes. and they all know him as ""Abu"", or father. The centre is run with strict discipline and the boys can only go out on arranged trips. Mr Edhi and his wife arrange marriages between the young men and women from other centres. He has been accused of encouraging families to break up, but without the village many of these boys would be on the streets, struggling to survive. The centre does not cater only for children. Drug addicts, the mentally ill and even unwanted animals all find sanctuary here. The recovering drug addicts live in a large, bare, tiled room with bars on the doors. They complain about the conditions, but this is almost the only treatment available in Pakistan. Some are brought here by their families, others come of their own accord. Tariq Aziz says the centre has made him face up to his heroin addiction. ""In other rehabilitation centres there are facilities such as beds, but seeing the people here and hearing how they lived has shocked me into realising that I have to stop."" Mr Edhi himself lives a simple life, always wearing the same grey clothes and never taking a holiday. It is his personal commitment - and the public's trust in him - that make the centres such as success. His wife, son and daughter are his closest workers and advisers, but there are fears about what will become of the organisation when Edhi is no longer around. He hopes his family will carry on where he has left off and calls the children he has helped his ""missionaries"", saying they will carry on his work after he has gone."
132,"It started with a very public spat between Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and Spurs counterpart Martin Jol, had the filling of Liverpool and West Ham reaching Cardiff, and was rounded off by the emergence of Luiz Felipe Scolari as favourite to succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson.  Let's start at Highbury and the controversy over Robbie Keane's goal in the 1-1 draw at Arsenal that saw Spurs edge closer to sealing fourth place.  Arsenal clearly felt Spurs should have put the ball out with two of Wenger's players down injured.  I have to beg to differ, and I feel Wenger should apologise to Jol for labelling him a liar over his insistence he never saw the incident.  The pictures are conclusive. Jol did not see it. He was looking at Edgar Davids all the time and Wenger has got it wrong.  I now feel an apology is in order from Wenger. People will understand the stakes were high, and things are said in the heat of the moment that are sometimes over the top.  I speak from experience. When my Liverpool team-mate Jim Beglin broke his leg in a challenge with Gary Stevens in a League Cup tie at Everton, I was asked what I thought of the tackle.  My response was: ""Apart from being a mile high and an hour late it was fine.""  I was speaking right after a game when I'd seen a mate badly injured by what I thought was a bad tackle. It was heat of the moment stuff on my part and it was later sorted out.  The issue of putting the ball out of play when someone is down injured is a thorny one - I believe Spurs were completely within their rights to play on at Highbury.  The injuries were not bad, referee Steve Bennett had checked, and was happy for play to continue.  I must stress I am not talking about Saturday's situation, which was a genuine collision between two players, but there is a growing fear that this recent piece of sportsmanship is open to abuse.  If there is a clash of heads or a very obvious injury, play should not go on, but there may be cases where if a player goes down and the opposition are attacking, they are not going to get up in a hurry and may hope play is stopped.  You can bracket it with diving. They are seeking to gain an unfair advantage.  Arsenal were not doing this on Saturday - but Jol still deserves an apology from Wenger.  Next up was the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Chelsea.  And while I am not the one to argue with a manager who has won the Champions League and will soon win back-to-back titles with Chelsea, Jose Mourinho got his tactics badly wrong in their 2-1 defeat.  I was astounded by the team he played and their formation. And this is not said with hindsight, I said it before the game.  Once Liverpool saw a team-sheet devoid of Joe Cole, Damien Duff and Arjen Robben, they would have been given a lift.  And the sight of Michael Essien at the point of a diamond, where he clearly is not suited to playing, would have cheered them further.  Essien didn't seem to have a clue where he was going, while Duff, Cole and Robben - who have all troubled Liverpool in the past - were left kicking their heels until it was too late.  The pairing of Geremi and Paolo Ferreira on the right-hand side of the diamond was also a disaster and Chelsea paid for it.  Liverpool survived a late siege, but won deservedly. Rafael Benitez got his tactics spot-on and they will now be favourites for the final against West Ham.  Benitez has closed the gap on Chelsea this season, which will have been his aim, but he will also be aware that Liverpool will not be back where they want to be until a title is secured.  Liverpool received the added boost of captain Steven Gerrard being named PFA player of the year, and deservedly so.  Some may make a case for Thierry Henry, but Gerrard has been unbelievable for Liverpool this season.  It is also a reward for consistency, because for around two years he carried Liverpool. It was as close as I have seen to a one-man team.  Liverpool will face West Ham in the final, and the Hammers may feel destiny is on their side.  What a story this is for Alan Pardew. The West Ham fans gave him some fierce criticism early in his reign and he handled himself with great dignity.  Said to be one game away from the sack last season. Said to be facing the sack if he didn't get in the play-offs. Said to be facing the sack if he didn't win the play-offs.  He's come through it all and has now taken them to Cardiff - I wonder will his critics say he should be sacked if West Ham don't beat Liverpool?  Pardew has done a great job and is a credit to his club.  The last piece of drama is the suggestion that Brazil World Cup winner Scolari will be England's next coach.  Where did he come from in all of this?  I must question the method of appointing Eriksson's successor.  FA chief executive Brian Barwick should have been given the brief, with perhaps Sir Trevor Brooking as an advisor.  It should have been their job, and their job alone, to sort this out.  Instead we have people reporting back to committees - you cannot appoint a man for a job like this by committee.  It has never worked and never will do.  You end up with compromise candidates, which is what Steve McClaren was portrayed as in the media and what Scolari is now.  I believe Barwick - with the help of someone like Brooking - should have been allowed to go out and get out who he thought was the best man.  For my money, that was always Martin O'Neill, but who knows if there will yet be a final twist in this tale."
133,"Venezuela's populist leader has urged Latin Americans to boycott celebrations for the anniversary of the ""discovery"" of the Americas by Christopher Columbus.  The 1492 arrival of the Italian explorer, employed by Spain, triggered a 150-year ""invasion"" of native Indians by foreign conquerors, who behaved ""worse than Hitler"", he said.  Columbus Day falls on 12 October and is celebrated with a public holiday on Monday in the United States and several Latin American nations.  But at a meeting in Caracas - attended by representatives of the indigenous population in South America, President Chavez said: ""Christopher Columbus was the spearhead of the biggest invasion and genocide ever seen in the history of humanity.""  Columbus Day should be remembered as the ""Day of Indian Resistance"", he said.  Spanish, Portuguese and other foreign conquerors had massacred South America's Indian inhabitants at an average rate of roughly ""one every 10 minutes"", he said.  He described Spanish conquistadors like Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro, as ""worse than Hitler"".  And he said even the continent's geographical names - such as America and Venezuela - were created and imposed by foreigners.  Opponents of Chavez - seeking a referendum to try to vote him out of office - say his real aim is to instal an anti-US communist system.  In his speech Chavez praised Indian chiefs who had fought against the invaders, such as Guaicaipuro who resisted the Spanish founders of Caracas, and American Indian chief Sitting Bull, who defeated US General George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.  ""Long live Sitting Bull!"" Chavez declared, drawing applause from his audience, many of whom wore traditional native clothes and head-dresses.  The second Monday in October was declared a national public holiday by president Richard Nixon in 1971."
134,"Rams skipper Ian Taylor had netted in the 90th minute to seemingly secure victory for the Rams.  But Poom, who had joined Sunderland for £3m at the start of the year, produced Peter Schmeichel-style heroics to convert Sean Thornton's injury-time corner with a towering backpost header.  It had been the visitors who made the early running, with Kevin Kyle posing the first threat of the game in only the second minute, his diving header just clearing the crossbar.  But central defender Gary Caldwell, on loan from Newcastle, went close with an aerial effort at the other end after 10 minutes.  Soon the Rams were on the offensive again, a sweeping move almost paying dividends on the quarter-hour mark when Tom Huddlestone saw his powerful low drive deflected wide by Williams.  Sunderland should have reached the break in front but Thomas Butler ballooned his effort high over the bar when the goal was at his mercy.  Hostilities were resumed in earnest when, in the 52nd minute Ian Taylor wrapping his left foot around a low drive which scuttled marginally wide of Poom's woodwork.  John Oster's direct dribble cut through the heart of the Derby defence only for the ball to be run out of play before Stewart tested Oakes with an overhead effort in the 55th minute.  But in an amazing finish, Poom's thunderous header found the back of the net with seconds remaining."
135,"The 33-year-old has been on loan at Highbury since August 2005 as part of the deal taking young full-back Justin Hoyte to Sunderland.  Now he has made his move permanent, signing an undisclosed contract despite having failed to represent the Gunners' first team so far this season.  ""I am really pleased that Arsene Wenger and the coaches have shown faith in me,"" Poom told Arsenal's website.  ""I'm really enjoying it here at Arsenal and will continue to work hard in training, so that I am ready to hopefully feature in the first team in the near future.""  The Estonia goalkeeper was signed by Arsene Wenger as back-up for Jens Lehmann and Manuel Almunia."
136,"The mediator trying to form a government in Belgium has announced a breakthrough after tense negotiations.  Politician Elio Di Rupo said the eight parties in the talks had agreed on moves to resolve key sticking points.  They included the division of power between French- and Dutch-speaking communities, he said.  The country has been without an elected government for 15 months. Disagreement centres on electoral boundaries in the linguistically divided Brussels region.  ""The eight parties have together succeeded in overcoming the obstacles which have created difficulties these last few days,"" Mr Di Rupo said in a statement.  Belgium's political crisis worsened on Tuesday when caretaker Prime Minister Yves Leterme announced he was leaving to take up a new job in Paris.  King Albert II cut short a holiday in France to fly back to Brussels following the news.  The king had appointed Mr Di Rupo, leader of Belgium's second-biggest party the French-speaking Socialist Party, to negotiate a coalition deal.  On Wednesday Mr Di Rupo said that negotiations faced imminent collapse and warned: ""The future of the country is at stake.""  But after further intense talks on Wednesday he was finally able to announce a breakthrough.  He said the parties had agreed on solutions to sticking points including a dispute over Bruxelles-Hal-Vilvorde (BHV), a district covering the capital and the suburbs.  BHV is the only district officially bilingual rather than French- or Dutch-speaking.  ""Even if the work is far from being finished and numerous debates have to be have to be worked out, the steps taken today... constitute an important step,"" the statement added.  Financial markets and rating agencies are pressing the country to create an effective government capable of carrying out structural reforms and reducing debt.  Mr Leterme announced he would leave by the end of this year to take up a post at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development."
137,"Hundreds of people had been taking part in a May Day protest over alleged corruption and illegal labour.  Police fired shots into the air and used dogs to try to disperse the marchers, as they veered off the route.  Protesters were complaining about the lack of local jobs due to an influx of cheap foreign labour caused by a recent boom in Macau's lucrative casino trade.  They accuse the government of turning a blind eye to the situation.  Some protesters carried signs saying, ""Severely punish employers of black market workers"", while others called for Macau's political leaders to stand down.  ""We are displeased with the labour crisis and the government's lack of action in dealing with it,"" said Ho Hen Kuok, president of the Macau Labour Union.  ""We don't want to see illegal labour being given jobs.""  ""The government is rich, the casinos are rich, but nobody is looking out for the Macau people,"" one marcher told the AFP news agency.  The protest turned violent as demonstrators tried to break through the police cordons lining their route.  Protesters surrounded one police vehicle and threw water bottles and placards at officers, who had boosted their lines with water cannons, the AFP reports.  Police also fired shots into the air, but it was not immediately clear if they had used blank or live rounds to disperse the crowds.  There were no reports of injuries, but several protesters were seen being led away by police.  Unlike nearby Hong Kong - another former European colony which was returned to China in the 1990s - such protests in Macau are uncommon.  Macau's population of 500,000 has a history of co-operation with the Beijing government.  The tiny territory has seen a surge in investment in recent years, with foreign gambling firms - mainly from the US - moving in to build new casino resorts.  Macau workers say that a resulting labour shortage in the territory has led many employers to hire cheap illegal labourers from mainland China."
138,"The new Band Aid single has been put together in record time - from a trip by Band Aid supremo Bob Geldof and Prime Minister Tony Blair to Ethiopia in early October to release on Monday. The momentum built up as October went on.  Shane Murray, who co-ordinated the release for Mercury Records, joined the project at the end of the month. He takes up the story of how it happened.  We had a set-up meeting and that was the first time we knew something was going to happen. It was people getting round a table for the first time. Usually with a record, the set-up time can be indefinite.  There had been no date set in stone and some of the key artists had come on board.  The Band Aid Trust had approached Nigel Godrich as a producer. He was able to get in a couple of key people who would serve as a catalyst for others to come on board - one being Chris Martin and the other being Fran Healy from Travis. Their involvement gave a lot of credibility towards what we were trying to do.  Robbie Williams did his bit in Los Angeles. He did it really early and Fran had done the guide vocal to a backing track that Midge and Nigel had come up with.  We had our first meeting with production company Initial, which is behind the forthcoming BBC One documentary, and the promo video.  The same day, we had the first meeting with our new media department, looking at things like ringtones and downloads.  You could tell it was building up to be a special day because so many people were saying ""yes, we'll do anything we can to help"".  The Trust had Damien Hirst's cover artwork for a couple of days before deciding they didn't want to use it, for their own reasons.  I had to react to that knowing that we had deadlines and we wanted someone who could turn around something fast but would do a fantastic job.  I asked one company, Big Active. ""How long have we got?"", they asked.  We had to have all our artwork and tracklisting and label copy all finished before the actual recording of the song took place because we had to start manufacturing the physical packaging in advance of making the CDs.  Instead of making 50,000 paper parts to put into CD cases, you're making 1.5 million. Two factories in Blackburn and Hanover began work.  We managed to have the backing track done by the time everyone came in on the Sunday. Quite a few people had done their vocal lines on the Saturday - Sugababes, Tom Chaplin from Keane, Justin and Dan from The Darkness had come in to do their guitar lines and Justin's vocal.  It certainly seemed that anyone who was there over the course of the weekend knew why they were there and were very privileged to be there.  They were just so amazing, so proactive, so eager to help. So many people beyond the recording day have said ""what can we do to help?""  Bob spelled out in very clear terms - the difference they were making today will save people's lives because people are going to go out and buy this record.  The record was actually mastered at Abbey Road studio at 2pm and we had various members of our radio promotions team on standby at Abbey Road.  They were handed about 30 or 40 master reference copies that afternoon and one of the promotions team flew up direct to Scotland. Another one went over to a CD duplication place.  Meanwhile, our production facilities had been sent by satellite the master of the new recording. They were able to physically turn around finished copies from about 4pm on Monday.  We had various people at radio stations across London and in Scotland and they hand-delivered the CDs at about 7:58 so nobody would jump the gun.  You have to have a week which is called call-off a week before the release date.  All your orders have to be in and you have to be in a position to send it to retailers over the course of the week so they can get them to their various stores. So from mastering the record on the Monday, we had to have all the stock at our Milton Keynes distribution warehouse by Friday.  Jo Whiley did the voiceover for free when she happened to be doing another job. We've been trying to keep the profile out there as much as profile. We're just going to send those out to everyone and say ""if you've got any space for an ad, give us some"".  I just want as many people as possible to buy it because it's been a privilege working with the people who have been a part of this.  Hopefully, we can make as many people as possible realise 20 years beyond the first Band Aid, there is a need to profile this again. It wasn't done to raise any artist's profile - it was done because the problems in Africa still exist."
139,"Sandra Burt was told she needed a licence to sing in the store    A shop assistant who was told she could not sing while she stacked shelves without a performance licence has been given an apology. Sandra Burt, 56, who works at A&T Food store in Clackmannanshire, was warned she could be fined for her singing by the Performing Right Society (PRS). However the organisation that collects royalties on behalf of the music industry has now reversed its stance. They have sent Mrs Burt a bouquet of flowers and letter of apology. Mrs Burt, who describes herself as a Rolling Stones fan, said that despite the initial warning from the PRS, she had been unable to stop herself singing at work. They would need to put a plaster over my mouth to get me to stop, I can't help it    The village store where Mrs Burt works was contacted by the PRS earlier this year to warn them that a licence was needed to play a radio within earshot of customers. When the shop owner decided to get rid of the radio as a result, Mrs Burt said she began singing as she worked. She told the BBC news website: ""I would start to sing to myself when I was stacking the shelves just to keep me happy because it was very quiet without the radio. ""When I heard that the PRS said I would be prosecuted for not having a performance licence, I thought it was a joke and started laughing. ""I was then told I could be fined thousands of pounds. But I couldn't stop myself singing. ""They would need to put a plaster over my mouth to get me to stop, I can't help it."" In response to the furore created by their initial hardline, the PRS contacted Mrs Burt to apologise. In a note attached to a large bouquet of flowers they said: ""We're very sorry we made a big mistake. ""We hear you have a lovely singing voice and we wish you good luck.""     "
140,"A group of Welsh musicians are forming their own agency to negotiate UK broadcasting rights following a five-year dispute over royalty payments.  The Welsh Music Publishers and Composers Alliance (WMPCA) claims the Performing Rights Society (PRS) changes cost the Welsh music industry £1.2m.  The campaigners said incomes from airplay had fallen by 85% since BBC Radio Cymru was classed as local radio.  A BBC spokesperson said it was ""watching developments"".  The prospect of a new royalty collection group representing Welsh musicians was first raised in 2010.  It followed changes in PRS payments which the WMPCA said led to a fall in royalties paid to Welsh artists from £1.6m in 2007 to £260,000 in 2009.  In December a group of musicians withdrew permission for BBC Radio Cymru to play their music for one day in protest at the lack of progress in resolving the dispute.  The WMPCA said it was concerned at the changes which it said treated BBC Radio Cymru as a local radio station paying 55p per minute of airtime, claiming it once paid the equivalent of £7.50 per minute.  Campaigners said composers and publishers in Wales would remain full members of PRS and would still receive royalties from the society for other rights, such as international use and live performances.  But UK broadcasting rights for around 50,000 musical works across a range of genres and periods would be assigned to an independent agency to be created in November, seeking higher rates of payment than under PRS.  Gwilym Morus, who is responsible for transferring the broadcasting rights from PRS to the new agency, said it would safeguard an important source of income for the Welsh music industry.  ""It's incredible to realise the amount of music that's out there, and it's testimony to how productive composers and authors in Wales have always been,"" he said.  ""It's clear that the new agency is the best way of ensuring that the industry can continue to be just as productive in the future, safeguarding incomes for individuals and companies, large and small alike.  ""It means that we can be paid a fair price for our work, while continuing to receive the other PRS royalties.""  Sain, Fflach and Ankst are among the major Welsh music publishers said to be joining the agency, along with artists such as Bryn Fon, Caryl Parry Jones, Gai Toms, Gwyneth Glyn and Meic Stevens, and bands including Cowbois Rhos Botwnnog, Yr Ods and Yr Angen.  The alliance plans to hold a meeting at the National Eisteddfod at Llandow, Vale of Glamorgan, on Friday at 16:00 BST to promote the initiative.  It was urging musicians to register with the new agency by mid-September to beat the annual deadline for renegotiating royalty payments.  A BBC spokesperson said: ""We are aware that discussions are on-going between the PRS and the Musicians Alliance and, in the best interests of our audiences, we will be keeping an eye on any developments."""
141,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Forty years ago on Saturday, one of the pop world's most famous and imitated album covers was shot in an ordinary-looking street in north London. The idea for the cover of the Beatles' Abbey Road album was initially to call it Everest, after the favourite brand of cigarettes smoked by their engineer Geoff Emerik. Then the thought of doing a Himalayan cover helped kill the idea, and instead they considered doing the shoot closer to home. ""There's a sketch Paul McCartney did with four little stick men crossing the zebra,"" says Brian Southall, author of the history of Abbey Road Studios. ""It gave a pretty good idea of what they wanted."" On 8 August 1969 the Fab Four walked out of No 3 Abbey Road, having finished basic work on what would be their penultimate album. A policeman held up the traffic, the band walked back and forth a few times and that was that    The photographer who took the famous cover shot was the late Iain Macmillan, a close friend of Brian Southall's, who knew the Beatles through working with Yoko Ono. ""He was given about 15 minutes,"" says Mr Southall. ""He stood up a stepladder while a policeman held up the traffic, the band walked back and forth a few times and that was that."" He took only seven or eight pictures, now in the Apple archive, but they're fascinating for their difference from the end product we all know. Most striking is the one of the band walking in the opposite direction (right to left), caught mid-stride in different poses. It looks all wrong of course, and draws attention to the accidental symmetry - despite Paul being out of step - of the final cover shot with its pattern of four firm inverted V shapes. In one of the alternative takes Paul McCartney is wearing sandals he kicked off during the shoot. This matters if you remember how the album cover was taken as evidence for the conspiracy theories that ""Paul is Dead."" Conspiracy theories abounded following Paul's barefoot appearance on the cover Barefooted, out of step, the car number plate behind him referring to his age - 28 if he'd lived - the Beatles forming a funeral procession for him. George was cast as the gravedigger, Ringo the undertaker, and John the priest. Years later in 1993, the very much alive Paul McCartney would spoof the cover and the rumours for his ""Paul is Live"" concert album. A lesser noted curiosity is that the album cover has no writing on it and is just the picture. That is thanks to John Kosh, who at the time, was creative director at Apple. ""I insisted we didn't need to write the band's name on the cover,"" he says. ""They were the most famous band in the world after all - EMI said they'd never sell any albums if we didn't say who the band was, but I got my way, and got away with it."" And it is hard to think of an album cover that has been so thoroughly repeated. Dozens of bands have put stripes on their cover, like the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, but of course the biggest tribute comes from the thousands of fans and tourists who go to leafy north London every year. I come here all the time and its always been the same... all they're doing is posing on the crossing    If you want to check the crossing now, there's a webcam. Watch it for a while and you will see scampering fans snatching at a gap in the traffic to recreate the shoot - much to the annoyance of local drivers. One black taxi cabbie, Ron, who also used to drive a bus down Abbey Road, told the BBC World Service: ""I come here all the time and it's always been the same - it really does annoy you. ""All they're doing is posing on the crossing. Someone's going to get mown down one of these days, there's no doubt about it."" Here's hoping Ron avoids the crossing on Saturday morning when Beatles fans will stage a mass crossing in honour of the photo shoot. It is not known how many of those fans are injured on the crossing every year. But the council have to repaint the wall next to the crossing every three months to cover over fans' graffiti. And the Abbey Road street sign has now been mounted out of reach up a wall, so often has it been defaced or stolen. If there was a way to steal the stripes off the zebra you can bet Beatles fans would have taken them too. Or maybe they haven't thanks to the rumour that the famous crossing you now see isn't actually the original and has been moved for safety reasons. And who would want to steal the wrong zebra crossing?     "
142,"The first known examples of writing may have been unearthed at an archaeological dig in Pakistan.  So-called 'plant-like' and 'trident-shaped' markings have been found on fragments of pottery dating back 5500 years.  Harappa was originally a small settlement in 3500 BC but by 2600 BC it had developed into a major urban centre.  According to Dr Richard Meadow of Harvard University, the director of the Harappa Archaeological Research Project, these primitive inscriptions found on pottery may pre-date all other known writing.  Last year it was suggested that the oldest writing might have come from Egypt.  Clay tablets containing primitive words were uncovered in southern Egypt at the tomb of a king named Scorpion.  They were carbon-dated to 3300-3200 BC. This is about the same time, or slightly earlier, to the primitive writing developed by the Sumerians of the Mesopotamian civilisation around 3100 BC.  ""It's a big question as to if we can call what we have found true writing,"" he told BBC News Online, ""but we have found symbols that have similarities to what became Indus script.  One major problem in determining what the symbols mean is that no one understands the Indus language. It was unique and is now dead.  Dr Meadow points out that nothing similar to the 'Rosetta Stone' exists for the Harappan text.  The Rosetta Stone, housed in the British museum since 1802, is a large slab of black basalt uniquely inscribed with the same text in both Egyptian hieroglyphs and Greek.  Its discovery allowed researchers to decipher the ancient Egyptian script for the first time.  The Harappan language died out and did not form the basis of other languages.  What historians know of the Harappan civilisation makes them unique. Their society did not like great differences between social classes or the display of wealth by rulers. They did not leave behind large monuments or rich graves.  They appear to be a peaceful people who displayed their art in smaller works of stone.  Their society seems to have petered out. Around 1900 BC Harappa and other urban centres started to decline as people left them to move east to what is now India and the Ganges.  This discovery will add to the debate about the origins of the written word.  It probably suggests that writing developed independently in at least three places - Egypt, Mesopotamia and Harappa between 3500 BC and 3100 BC."
143,"Israel has been evacuating its citizens from Kenya after two attacks on Israeli targets in the city of Mombasa which killed at least 15 people.  In an overnight operation that went on into the early hours, four military Hercules planes with teams of doctors and psychologists flew into Mombasa and evacuated injured Israeli tourists and all those who wanted to leave.  Earlier, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to hunt down the perpetrators of the attacks.  ""Our long arm will get those who carried out the terror attacks. No one will be forgiven,"" Mr Sharon said shortly after being re-elected to lead his Likud party into January's general elections.  American and Israeli investigators have arrived in Kenya to help with the investigation.  Twelve civilians - including one Israeli adult and two children - were killed alongside the three suicide attackers at an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombasa.  In a separate attack, two missiles narrowly missed an Israeli holiday jet that had taken off from the city's airport.  Mr Sharon has put the Mossad intelligence agency, which has a reputation for ruthlessness, in charge of investigating the attacks. American investigators are reported to have joined the hunt.  Mossad is best known for hunting down and killing several Palestinians suspected of the kidnap and murder of 11 Israelis at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Kenya has pledged to spare no efforts in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the attacks.  Police said they were questioning two men who were detained in Mombasa after the attacks, but gave no further details.  Security has been stepped up throughout the country since the attacks, especially in coastal areas and national parks frequented by tourists.  US security officials have been sent to protect American citizens on a cruise ship currently docked in Mombasa harbour.  The bombing, at 0800 local time (0500 GMT) on Thursday, reduced a large part of the Paradise Hotel to rubble and the rest to a smouldering shell.  Kenyan police said that as well as the three Israelis, nine Kenyans died, most of whom were said to be traditional dancers who came to welcome the tourists.  Three suicide bombers were also killed, they added.  The blast occurred just after some 60 visitors had checked into the hotel, all of them from Israel, hotel officials said.  In Lebanon, a previously unknown group called the Army of Palestine has said it carried out the attacks.  The group said it wanted the world to hear the ""voice of the refugees"" on the 55th anniversary of the partition of Palestine.  But Kenyan and Israeli officials speculated that Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network might have been responsible.  Washington condemned the attacks, but said it was too early to blame al-Qaeda.  ""Today's attacks underscore the continuing willingness of those opposed to peace to commit horrible crimes,"" President George W Bush said in Crawford, Texas, where he was spending the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  ""The United States remains firmly committed, with its partners around the world, to the fight against terror and those who commit these heinous acts.""  Mr Bush urged all ""those who seek peace... to dismantle the infrastructure of terror"".  If confirmed as the work of al-Qaeda, it would be their first direct attack on Israelis - despite Bin Laden's hostility towards Israel.  Mombasa, on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, is a popular destination for foreign visitors and the hotel was frequented mainly by Israeli tourists.  In 1998, the US embassies in Kenya and neighbouring Tanzania were attacked in nearly simultaneous car bombings that killed 219 people and 12 people respectively. The US blamed al-Qaeda.  Coordinated, synchronised attacks are a hallmark of al-Qaeda, and the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says months of careful surveillance clearly went into the latest Kenya attacks.  In the second attack, missiles were fired at an Arkia airline plane - a Boeing 757 carrying 261 passengers.  The airliner landed safely at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv about five hours later. It was escorted in by Israeli F-15 fighter jets.  Kenyan police said a missile launcher and two missile casings were found in the Changamwe area of Mombasa, about two kilometres from the airport.  The Arkia charter company has a regular weekly service flying tourists between Tel Aviv and Mombasa."
144,"Marks and Spencer has reported a big fall in profits, despite rising sales across the group.  Pre-tax profits fell to £564.3m, down from £658m last year, despite group sales rising 1.3% to £10bn for the year to 30 March.  While underlying sales of food rose 1.7%, sales of general merchandise - which includes clothing - fell 4.1% in the year.  Chief executive Marc Bolland described the market as ""challenging"".  M&S's clothing division, which has an 11% market share in the UK, has been struggling in recent years as sales have fallen.  In April, director of lingerie and beauty Janie Schaffer, who joined M&S from lingerie chain Victoria's Secret, left after just three months in the job.  In an effort to address its problems, M&S last year changed its retail team, bringing in Belinda Earl, a former chief executive of both Debenhams and Jaeger, as head of style. Last week it launched a new autumn/winter clothing collection, which it hopes will win back disaffected customers.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Bolland said: ""We won't duck the fact that we feel we have underperformed in general merchandise.  ""We have to improve on quality"", he added.  Mr Bolland also defended the company's tax affairs in the wake of controversy over tax avoidance schemes.  There was ""nothing fiscal"" in the company's use of Ireland as a trading hub for its international e-commerce business, he said, as the country now handles more than 50% of online trade.  ""M&S pays UK corporation tax on all the profits generated by UK sales"", he said. ""We contributed £800m to the UK tax authorities in 2011-12 - the 25th highest tax contributor in the UK.""  He maintained that M&S paid more corporation tax than many other FTSE 100 companies of bigger size.  The company also said it had appointed Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne - currently M&S's corporate director of strategy implementation and business development - as its new marketing director. He will succeed Steven Sharp in July.  M&S said Mr Sharp had ""played a significant role in shaping the M&S brand from the introduction of the 'Your M&S' branding in 2004 to numerous iconic advertising campaigns reinforcing M&S's quality, style and ethical credentials"".  M&S said that its international sales had risen by 4.5% over the past year.  Multi-channel sales, which include internet shopping, rose by 16.6% and now account for 13% of general merchandise sales.  About 3.6 million people visit the website each week, the company said, while in-store pick-up of online orders was proving increasingly popular.  Retail analysts Conlumino said that although international and online sales were growing, M&S needed to ""focus firmly"" on its UK business.  ""On this 'home front' advancement is a little less encouraging and, in clothing at least, has seemed more like a gentle evolution than a radical reinvention,"" Conlumino said.  ""We still believe M&S is nowhere near ambitious enough on the general merchandise front; in our view the company is too risk averse and is unwilling to break the mould of its traditional ways of doing business."""
145,"Some Marks and Spencer customers have told the BBC of cases where the chain's contactless payment terminals have taken money from cards other than the ones intended for payment.  Card are supposed to be within about 4cm of the front of the contactless terminal to work.  But some customers say payments have been taken from cards while in purses and wallets at much greater distances.  M&S said its systems had been extensively tested and were robust.  Marks and Spencer recently rolled out the contactless payments system to 644 UK stores.  The system uses something called Near Field Communication to identify a card and take payment.  Rosemary, from Sussex, got a shock when she tried to pay by chip-and-pin at her local store.  She believes her contactless Smile card was much more than 4cm away from the terminal when she visited Marks and Spencer in Chichester in April and tried to pay with her regular Lloyds debit card.  She told BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme: "" I put my card into the reader and the assistant was asking whether or not I wanted cash back.  ""Before I could answer, the transaction came up as complete and the till issued a receipt so I hadn't put in a Pin at all at that stage. I queried it with an assistant and she looked rather puzzled and looked at the receipt and compared it to my card and realised that the numbers didn't tally.""  Rosemary recognised that the four digits on the till receipt belonged to a Smile card she had in her purse, which she was holding in her other hand.  She had not realised until then that this card was able to make contactless payments.  Even when she realised it could, she thought her purse was about a foot away from the terminal when the payment was taken.  Rosemary explained what had happened to a Marks and Spencer manager, who asked her to try to repeat the transaction so he could see it himself.  Again, the Smile contactless card was debited instead of the Lloyds card she had intended to make the payment from.  M&S refunded the two transactions and a third attempt to use the Lloyds card to pay was successful.  Paula, from London, ended up paying for the same items twice.  Like Rosemary, she put her NatWest card into the chip-and-pin terminal but had her HSBC contactless card she was holding in her purse in her other hand debited instead, before she could enter her PIN.  She did not realise that she had a contactless card, and so then paid for the same items by entering the PIN for her regular debit card.  It was only a month later when she looked at her bank statement that she realised that her HSBC card was contactless, and that she had paid twice.  She returned to Marks and Spencer with her statement and it refunded her the payment on her NatWest card.  It's not just Marks and Spencer customers who have experienced this sort of problem.  A Pret a Manger customer also contacted Money Box to report a payment was taken from her contactless-enabled MBNA visa credit card in the outlet when she intended to pay with a different card.  She says the MBNA card was in her purse around 30-40 cm from the contactless card reader.  And again, she had not realised that card had a contactless facility.  Martin Emms is a researcher into new payment formats at Newcastle University's Centre for Cybercrime and Computer Security.  He also found his contactless card was debited when he placed it a few centimetres to the side of the reader from inside his wallet when he intended to pay with a normal debit card.  ""If you're placing your card to the side of the reader your intention isn't to pay,"" he said. ""The terminal is working within the specification of Near Field Communication but not within the intent.""  Money Box first raised this as an issue with Marks and Spencer back in February. It told the programme the maximum distance its terminal can read a contactless card is 4cm directly above the terminal and the field does not extend beyond the edge of the terminal area. And it said its contactless payment cannot be made if there is another card placed in the reader.  Marks and Spencer said it would like to hear from any customer who had experienced an involuntary payment.  ""We are surprised to hear the comments from your listeners, we've had almost entirely positive feedback and take-up has been very strong. We have tested our systems extensively both in labs and in stores and are confident they are robust and fit for purpose.  ""A contactless card can be read through material, e.g. a wallet, but the wallet would have to be presented to the terminal. ""  The technology used by M&S is provided by Visa Europe.  It said that the customer reports were ""extremely unusual"", and it was working with M&S and the acquiring bank to investigate the concerns.  Pret a Manger said it had not heard before of customers experiencing this, but it was investigating and it would like to hear from any other customers who have had this happen to them.  Money Box spoke to the banks whose contactless cards had been debited in error.  They said they explained what contactless cards were in accompanying literature when they sent them out.  And they said the effective range of the card was 5cm.  Richard Koch, head of policy at banking industry body UK Cards, admitted that the banks and retailers may have to look at ways of improving the contactless system.  ""We're very much in the initial stages of the roll out of contactless. We're monitoring very closely the issues that are presented,"" he said.  Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.  You can listen again via the BBC iPlayer or by downloading Money Box podcast."

The extent of the injury from the attack in Portugal was kept quiet, a film based on an aide's memoirs says. The ultra-conservative Spanish priest, Juan Maria Fernandez y Krohn, was convicted and jailed in Portugal. His attack came a year after the Pope was wounded by Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca in St Peter's Square in Rome. The Pope died in 2005, aged 84. I can now reveal that the Holy Father was wounded. When we got back to the room [in the Fatima sanctuary complex] there was blood    The latest revelation was made in a new documentary film based on the memoirs of the Pope's personal secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz. He said that during the Pope's visit to a shrine in Fatima in Portugal, the priest came at the pontiff with a bayonet. According to Cardinal Dziwisz, the priest managed to draw blood with the weapon but was overcome by the Pope's security guards. ""I can now reveal that the Holy Father was wounded. When we got back to the room [in the Fatima sanctuary complex] there was blood,"" he says in the documentary. Krohn was sentenced to six and a half years for the attack The Pope did not reveal the injury at the time and continued with the trip. There has been no comment from the Vatican on the cardinal's revelations. The documentary film, Testimony, pulls together material from the Pope's private life as related by Cardinal Dziwisz. He is now the cardinal of Krakow in Poland and served as John Paul's private secretary for nearly 40 years, including all his 27 years as Pope. The 90-minute film marks the first time the Vatican has opened its doors to foreign cameras. Pope Benedict XVI will watch a preview later on Thursday.     "
147,"The body of a top Italian banker has been found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London.  Known as God's banker for his links with the Vatican, 62-year-old Roberto Calvi was the chairman of Banco Ambrosiano in Milan and a central figure in a complex web of international fraud and intrigue.  He had been missing for the last nine days before his body was discovered by a passer-by hanging from scaffolding on a riverside walk under the bridge.  Police are treating the death as suicide.  Mr Calvi became chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, now Italy's largest private bank, in 1975 and built up a vast financial empire.  In 1978, a report by the Bank of Italy on Ambrosiano concluded that several billion lire had been illegally exported.  In May 1981, Mr Calvi was arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to four years' imprisonment, but released pending an appeal. During his short spell in jail he attempted suicide.  Mr Calvi was due to appear in an Italian court next week to appeal against this conviction.  Later this month he was to be tried for alleged fraud involving property deals with Sicilian banker Michele Sindona, who is himself serving 25 years in America over the collapse of the Franklin National Bank in New York in 1974.  The Vatican is directly linked to Mr Calvi by Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, the Pope's bodyguard, a governor of the Vatican and head of the Vatican bank which has a shareholding in Ambrosiano.  Now Ambrosiano is on the verge of collapse amid press reports that investigators found a £400m ""hole"" in its accounts. Last week the bank's executive board decided to strip Mr Calvi of his authority.  The Italian Treasury dissolved the bank's administration and the Bank of Italy is now a temporary commissioner.  Mr Calvi fled to Venice nine days ago after shaving his moustache to avoid being recognised.  From there it seems he hired a private plane to take him to London.  The day before he was found dead, his secretary committed suicide in Milan by jumping off the fourth floor of the bank's headquarters.  Teresa Corrocher, aged 55, left an angry suicide note condemning her boss for the damage she said he had done to Ambrosiano and its employees."
148,"Premium bond holders are being offered a 50% increase in their prizes Competition for savers' money is being stepped up with a 50% rise in the prize money on offer to Premium Bond holders. National Savings & Investments (NS&I) will increase the prize fund payout rate from 1% to 1.5% in October, taking the total payout from £33.8m to £52.5m. The prize rate is normally adjusted along with Bank of England's interest rate. In March NS&I cut its prize rate from 1.8% to 1%. There are 23 million people with Premium Bonds, with £40bn invested. ""NS&I reviews the interest rates on all of its savings products each month to ensure it continues to balance the interests of its savers, the taxpayer and the stability of the wider financial services market,"" said Peter Cornish of National Savings. NS&I exists to borrow money from the public to help fund government spending. In the wake of the collapse of Northern Rock bank in the autumn of 2007, and the banking crisis a year ago, public money flooded into NS&I policies - including Premium Bonds and other accounts - as people looked for an absolutely safe home for their savings. But after NS&I exceeded its fund raising target in the last financial year, 2008/09, the savings trend has reversed. In the first three months of the 2009/10 year, NS&I saw a net outflow of money as people responded to higher rates available from banks and building societies, or preferred to use their money to spend or to pay off debts. During that quarter there was a £4.5bn gross outflow of cash, which outstripped new inflows of £3.2bn. The average rate on a bank or building society notice account has almost doubled in the past month to 0.43%, according to figures from the Bank of England. And bank and building society fixed rate accounts, usually known as bonds, offer an average of 3.03%. According to the financial information service Moneyfacts, the top bond rates on offer to savers range from 3.85% for one year with the Post Office, to 4.65% for three years from the Yorkshire Building Society, and 5.4% for five years from Aldermore. In May, NS&I raised the interest rate on its own instant access savings account, known as an income bond, by 1%.     "
149,"Investors in Premium Bonds can now add an extra £10,000 to their investment, although the chances of winning the £1m jackpots remain slim.  The maximum permitted investment has risen to £50,000 from the previous limit of £40,000.  Premium Bonds are issued by government-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&I).  Instead of paying interest, Premium Bonds are entered into monthly draws for prizes.  The investment limit rise was announced in the 2014 Budget, with the change coming into force on Monday.  Every one of the 54.2 billion bonds has an equal chance of winning one of the two top prizes of £1m, but the chances are the equivalent of flipping a coin and getting 34 consecutive heads. The odds of winning any prize of between £25 and £1m with a single £1 bond are 26,000 to one.  People need to be aged 16 years old or over to buy Premium Bonds, although parents, guardians and grandparents can invest on behalf of their child or grandchild."
150,"Francis Aungier Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford - universally known as Frank - was a member of that exclusive band of people, the mere mention of whose name provokes visceral debate.  To the popular press he was ""Lord Porn"" or ""Lord Wrongford"". He was caricatured as both a reactionary, who sought to undermine freedom of speech by banning pornography, or as a misguided and dangerous liberal, set upon flooding the UK with newly freed mass murderers and rapists.  Others - like Peter Stanford who wrote Longford's biography, The Outcast's Outcast - take a different view.  The urge for transformation was seemingly hard-wired into Lord Longford's being. Originally a Conservative, he became a socialist.  A member of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, whose family title went back to the 17th Century, he later proved to be a committed Irish nationalist and was considered a class traitor by many of his fellow aristocrats.  And the man who was by birth a Protestant spent most of his life as a devout and practically minded Roman Catholic.  Born in 1905, Lord Longford took a double First at Oxford before becoming an Oxford don.  After having a nervous breakdown while in the Army during World War II, he served as the lead assistant to Sir William Beveridge, the creator of the framework for the modern welfare state.  Even then he courted controversy. As Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Longford had responsibility for post-war Germany.  His decision to ""forgive"" the German people, went down badly with his ministerial colleagues.  Even so, Longford enjoyed a close relationship with the West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who called him ""the founder of modern Germany"". He went on to serve in a number of ministerial posts up to 1968.  Though he was chairman of the National Bank - a large Irish financial institution - and was effective in loosening the Republic's dependence on the City of London, there were times when Lord Longford's idealism could be seen as other-worldly.  For instance, his commission into pornography - inspired by Mary Whitehouse's campaign to ""clean up"" the British media. Lord Longford formed his own committee of the great and good, which visited sex clubs in Denmark in a quest for greater understanding.  One member of the commission was broadcaster Gyles Brandreth. ""At the time the proceedings of the committee - and the media circus that surrounded its activities - were indeed ludicrous,"" he says.  ""But, 30 years on, it's intriguing to find that most people would agree with the thrust of what Lord Longford was saying. His line was that pornography was degrading - to its users and to those who worked in the trade, especially women.""  ""We would pass enormous lurid breasts hanging out of doorways and he wouldn't even notice,"" he says.  ""I felt we could probably have run into a naked woman in the street and he wouldn't have noticed.""  But it was his campaign to free Hindley which still most divides opinion on Lord Longford.  He first met her in May 1969, four years after she and Ian Brady were jailed for life for murdering three children. She would later admit two more killings.  The man whose 1963 report had paved the way for the parole system fervently believed that Hindley - just one among numerous prisoners befriended by Longford over the years - would be a prime candidate for early release.  ""He knew what he was talking about,"" says Mr Stanford. ""He set the system up.""  For more than 30 years he consistently put his reputation on the line in an attempt to convince successive governments and the public, that Hindley was a reformed and remorseful character. He described Brady as ""bonkers"".  The two became close and, until recently, it was believed that Hindley saw Lord Longford as her best chance of freedom.  In the end Hindley, who died in prison in November 2002, distanced herself from the peer, relying increasingly on others to speak out on her behalf.  Seen in this light, Lord Longford - who died 15 months before Hindley - might appear to be the dupe of a calculating and highly intelligent woman. But this would to be to under-estimate both the complexity and certainty of his beliefs.  Jim Broadbent, who portrays him in the Channel 4 film, says: ""His moral certainty was attractive and frustrating.""  To Gyles Brandreth, he was ""a man with enormous heart - human, human. I was grateful to know the man"".  For Peter Stanford, it is Lord Longford's belief in forgiveness and redemption which lies at the heart of his hugely relevant message.  ""Redemption is something we, as a society, are very bad at,"" he says. ""Eight-out-of-10 juvenile prisoners currently re-offend, and seven-out-of-10 over-21s do the same.  ""Lord Longford's argument for a different, more compassionate, approach, to prison is more important than ever."""
151,"Big Bill liked his drink. So much so it is alleged he sank 10 pints before a snooker match to steady his nerves.  In an era when sport stars wore tight outfits as a result of fashion dictating, Werbeniuk had no choice but to wear tight outfits because his weight fluctuated around 20 stone.  So the combination of being a heavy drinker, vastly overweight and a smoker - yes, he smoked as well - made him a cult figure on the circuit.  But like other vice-ridden players of his time, he was also very good at snooker.  Werbeniuk occupied the world's top 16 for seven out of eight seasons.  The highlight of his career came in 1984 when he reached the final of the Lada Classic - he lost 9-5.  He also reached the quarter-final stage of the World Snooker Championship on four occasions.  The Canadian was a big favourite at The Crucible and always played to the crowd. On one occasion he broke wind at the venue then turned around to ask the audience, ""Who did that?""  But by the late 1980s things took a turn for the worse for the loveable Canadian.  Werbeniuk began to take the drug Inderal on the advice of his doctors to help his alcohol intake.  Unfortunately, the contents of the drug were on the snooker governing body's (WPBSA) banned substances list.  Werbeniuk, though, continued to take the drug and after receiving a number of fines he quit the sport.  In his last professional match in 1990 he said: ""I've had 24 pints of extra strong lager and eight double vodkas and I'm still not drunk.""  Werbeniuk returned to Canada and played a bit of pool before falling on bad times.  A year before his death in January 2003 he was out of work and living on disability benefits.  The big Canadian's passing was mourned by many fans around the world, who had not only lost a popular figure but a great player from snooker's golden age.  Part Four: The infamous Francisco pair get the Bad Boys treatment."
152,"Wayne Rooney hit a hat-trick and Javier Hernandez scored twice as a rampant Manchester United outclassed Bolton to go top of the Premier League.  The champions took an early lead when Hernandez pounced at the near post.  Rooney converted Phil Jones' cross to make it two, then the England striker profited from another of the defender's runs to add a third.  Hernandez swept in a fourth before Rooney drilled in his third - but Tom Cleverley may have broken his foot.  Crumpling under a heavy challenge from Kevin Davies, the midfielder was replaced midway through the first half.  But it was the only blemish for Sir Alex Ferguson's side after another impeccable performance brought up their 200th away win in the Premier League - the first club to achieve the milestone.  United's last trip to the Reebok Stadium ended in a 2-2 draw almost a year ago, when they had to rely on a late Michael Owen header to salvage a point.  But this encounter was very different as Hernandez, making his first start of the season, gave United the perfect opening.  Showing the superb movement he is renowned for, the Mexico striker lost Gary Cahill with a darting run to the near post to steer in Nani's tantalising low cross from the right.  The goal came while United were temporarily down to 10 men following the injury to Cleverley.  Bolton looked to hit back immediately, but former United midfielder Chris Eagles saw his shot cleared off the line by Rooney.  Despite the high-profile errors United's new goalkeeper David De Gea has made this season, he went some way to silencing his doubters with an impressive flying save from Ivan Klasnic's long-range effort. And the stop ignited United, who made it 2-0 just 74 seconds later.  United's verve and invention overwhelmed Bolton and Rooney doubled United's lead in the 20th minute.  Catching the home side napping, Jones whipped in a devilish cross from the right to Rooney, who found himself between Cahill and Dedryck Boyata before prodding in from close range.  Rooney poured further misery on the home side, making it 3-0 in the 24th minute with a goal engineered by Jones, whose stature is growing with every game.  Exploiting a gaping hole in the home side's defence, Jones' twinkle-toed run took him into the penalty area, before he squared the ball to Rooney to find the back of the net with the easiest of finishes.  With manager Owen Coyle barking instructions from the touchline, Bolton limited United to three in the first half but, while Klasnic and Martin Petrov linked well at times, the home side were painfully short of creativity.  It was only a matter of time before United added to their lead and, two minutes before the hour mark, Hernandez made it 4-0.  Substitute Michael Carrick found the Mexican lurking at the far post and, with the Bolton defence at sea, his low effort had Jussi Jaaskelainen well beaten.  Nigel Reo-Coker struck the crossbar as Bolton desperately looked for a route back into the game but, minutes later, Rooney put the gloss on the win with United's fifth - and his third.  Collecting Nani's cut-back from the right the England striker nonchalantly struck his hat-trick goal from the edge of the box to give him his seventh career treble.  Rooney also becomes the fourth player to score back-to-back Premier League hat-tricks after Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright and Didier Drogba.  Sequels rarely match the original and United's short trip to the Reebok was always likely to pale in comparison to their famous 8-2 mauling of Arsenal a fortnight ago - but United remain the team to beat after another scintillating display."
153,"England striker Wayne Rooney's ban for the Euro 2012 Championship has been reduced to two matches from three after an appeal to Uefa in Switzerland.  He was punished after being sent off for kicking Miodrag Dzudovic during a 2-2 draw with Montenegro in October.  Rooney, 26, will now be available for England's third Group D game, against joint hosts Ukraine, but will miss the fixtures against France and Sweden.  The third match of his ban has been suspended for four years.  A Uefa spokesman told BBC Sport the third game ban would kick in only if he is sent off for violent conduct in another European Championship match.  ""The ban applies only to national team competition governed by Uefa,"" said the spokesman.  Rooney has also agreed to do one day of community service with a Uefa project.  England manager Fabio Capello joined Rooney for the 90-minute hearing before a three-man appeals panel on Thursday morning.  The Manchester United forward travelled to Nyon for the appeal after his club's shock Champions League exit at FC Basel on Wednesday.  Adrian Bevington, the Football Association director of communications and Club England managing director, said: ""We've had a very fair hearing.  ""Wayne and Fabio are both very pleased. Wayne will head back to Manchester as a matter of priority.  ""Wayne has always made clear that he accepted it was a red card offence.  ""We arrived with the possibility of him missing the entire group phase - it would have been a huge challenge for Fabio and the team, so to have him available for the final group march against Ukraine is clearly very positive.""  It is believed the FA argued a three-match ban that affects games in the finals of a major tournament is a harsher sanction than a suspension of a similar length which would just affect qualifying games.  The appeal included a written letter by Dzudovic asking that the ban be reduced and the FA sent a team including Adam Lewis QC, who has previous experience of chairing Rugby Football Union appeal hearings, a Swiss sports lawyer, its own solicitor James Bonnington and a representative from external lawyers Charles Russell.  Rooney had previously admitted the kick was ""stupid"" but maintained that the ban was ""a bit harsh"".  The striker, who has scored 28 goals in 73 appearances for England, was not included in the 1-0 friendly wins over Spain and Sweden in November.  But Capello has said his most prolific forward will appear in subsequent friendlies in the new year, with one organised against the Netherlands at Wembley on 29 February.  BBC pundit Mark Lawrenson said he expected Capello to select Rooney for Euro 2012.  ""England will now obviously take Wayne Rooney but I always thought they would - that question was like asking Argentina would they take Lionel Messi to the World Cup in similar circumstances. Of course they would,"" he said.  ""Rooney's presence will be a lift to Fabio Capello and the other players. If they go into that game against Ukraine needing a win or a draw to go through they can call on him - and the fact that he is there might just inspire some big performances in the first two games from players who don't want to get left out of the third one.  ""It's really good news for England and Capello and I think the right level of punishment has been reached in the end.  ""I always wonder when Uefa give a three-game ban whether they are actually leaving leeway for an appeal and then room for them to reduce it.""  Manchester United will play in the Europa League after being knocked out of the Champions League, but a Uefa spokesman said the suspended third game of his ban could not be invoked by a dismissal for his club.  If Rooney was sent off for violent conduct at Euro 2012, he would miss the following two matches - one automatic game for a dismissal, plus another invoked under the current suspension.  So for example, he would be out of the semi-final and final should he be dismissed for violent conduct in any quarter-final game."
154,"Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell has insisted the removal of manager Lee Bradbury was ""best for the club"".  The Cherries announced they had parted company with Bradbury on Sunday, the day after defeat at Oldham saw them slip to 13th in League One.  Mitchell told BBC Radio Solent: ""Lee and I spent a considerable time on Sunday morning talking and we couldn't conclude together.  ""I wish Lee a great future and I'm sure our paths will cross again.""  Mitchell refused to confirm whether youth team manager Paul Groves and head of youth Shaun Brooks, whom the club had announced would take charge until the end of the season, would remain in control beyond tomorrow's match against Stevenage.  However in a separate press conference held on Monday afternoon, Groves said he had been told he would be in charge until the end of the season.  He also said Bradbury had rejected Mitchell's proposal that Groves and Brooks assist his work with the first team.  Mitchell also declined to comment on the future of Bradbury's assistant Russ Wilcox and coach Ryan Garry.  The club later published a statement on their website saying Wilcox had been placed on gardening leave for a fortnight, following which he would ""return to the Seward Stadium to discuss his future"".  Groves said Garry would continue to work as first team coach.  Mitchell added: ""As you know, Lee has had 100% support from me from day one and that's never changed. I don't want to comment on other people.""  Asked whether he had taken the decision together with Russian co-owner Maxim Demin, Mitchell responded: ""That's too much detail. It's just the case that there is a change and really that's as much as I'd like to say.  ""I just don't really feel it's my place to comment on where we are in the league. As far as I'm concerned the situation is as it is.""  The loss at Oldham on Saturday was Bournemouth's sixth defeat in eight games.  Bradbury, 36, took over as manager when Eddie Howe left for Burnley in January 2011, and guided the club to the League One play-off semi-finals last term, where they lost to Huddersfield on penalties.  Only last week Mitchell claimed he was happy with the club's current position in League One and believed they were making progress.  Bournemouth made a slow start this season, but rose up the table around the festive period before Bradbury signed a contract extension until 2015 in January."
155,"A US judge has dismissed a legal action accusing Harry Potter author JK Rowling of copying the work of another author.  The estate of late author Adrian Jacobs claimed that the plot of fourth Harry Potter outing Goblet of Fire plagiarised parts of his book The Adventures of Willy the Wizard.  Judge Shira Sheindlin wrote in her ruling that there were major differences between the two works.  She added they were ""distinctly different in both substance and style"".  ""The contrast between the total concept and feel of the works is so stark that any serious comparison of the two strains credulity,"" Judge Sheindlin said in the 49-page ruling.  Scholastic, the US publisher for the Harry Potter books, said it was satisfied with the decision.  ""The court's swift dismissal supports our position that the case was completely without merit and that comparing Willy the Wizard to the Harry Potter series was absurd,"" spokesman Kyle Good said.  ""Scholastic will continue to vigorously defend any such frivolous claims challenging the originality of Harry Potter.""  The estate of British author Jacobs, who died in 1997, had claimed Rowling copied the plots of his 1987 book including a wizard contest, and the idea of wizards travelling on trains.  When the estate filed a similar legal action against British publisher Bloomsbury last February, Rowling said that she had never heard of Mr Jacobs's book before the original copyright claim was made in 2004.  In October, the judge overseeing that case at London's High Court said that the claims were ""improbable,"" but he turned down an application by lawyers for Rowling and Bloomsbury for an immediate dismissal of the case.  The first Harry Potter Book was published in 1997 and the series has sold more than 400 million copies worldwide."

It was delayed while some IOC members expressed concern about the process by which the sports had been selected for inclusion by the IOC's executive board. But when the vote was finally taken both passed with flying colours, although the majority in favour of golf was somewhat smaller than that in favour of its fellow returnee to the Olympic family. Both sports were part of the Games programme in the early part of the twentieth century before being dropped, and golf returns to the Games for the first time since the St Louis Olympics of 1904. One of the main issues had been whether top players would compete in the Olympics but the game's brightest star, Tiger Woods, had indicated on Tuesday he would play. We want to play our part in strengthening and growing the Olympic movement - rugby is reaching out    Golf's presentation video included stars of past and present including Jack Nicklaus, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Woods. ""It's win-win for both sides - golf is such a global sport. I couldn't think of a better sport to be part of the Olympic Games,"" said Woods. The presentation party on the day included 16-year-old Italian Matteo Manassero, the 2009 British amateur champion, and American Michelle Wie, who said it would be a ""dream"" to play in the Olympics. Wie said: ""I can dream about being an Olympian, and I can dream of doing something not even Tiger or Ernie has ever done, that is to make the putt to win the gold medal."" Nicklaus, an 18-time major winner, said: ""All of us who have spent our lives playing and enjoying the game of golf fully understand why it deserved a spot on the Olympic programme. ""Now the sport I have always called the greatest game of all can be shared with the rest of the world on the greatest stage in sports."" Rugby union was last part of the Olympics in 1924 in the full 15-man version of the code, and will return to the Games in the truncated seven-a-side version. Rugby sevens was represented on the day by stars including All Black legend Jonah Lomu, former Argentina captain Agustin Pichot, Kenya captain Humphrey Kayange and Australia women's captain Cheryl Soon. A number of delegates preferred to praise the sport rather than question the panel, but among the queries posed was whether the game's top stars would play in Rio. Lomu, a former Commonwealth Games gold medallist, said: ""To see my sport in the best arena would be fantastic for rugby, men's and women's. We are very passionate about it - you just have to say where we have to play and the best players will come. ""I can speak for all of them - they will turn up."" Soon said it would be ""a privilege"" to play in the Olympics, while Pichot added: ""We want to play our part in strengthening and growing the Olympic movement - rugby is reaching out.""     "
157,"Spice Girls publicists have denied rumours that the group is splitting up following claims by Mel C that she ""does not intend to do any more work"" with the band.  It ain't over until it's over and it ain't over  Rumours of a split began circulating when the 27-year-old star told Reuters news agency: ""I don't intend to do any more work with the Spice Girls.  ""Really, I've not been comfortable being in the Spice Girls for probably the last two years.  ""It doesn't really feel that natural to me any more.  ""I've grown up and I just feel that I want to do things my own way and not compromise.""  Mel C is widely considered to be the strongest vocalist in the group and from an early stage was said to be unhappy about her ""Sporty Spice"" image.  But the Spice Girls publicity machine has brushed aside her comments, insisting the band has a strong future.  Spice Girls spokesman Alan Edwards said: ""Melanie C hasn't left the Spice Girls.  ""Everyone wants to say it's over but it isn't, the group have still got strong ties.  ""What she said is that we've got no plans at the moment and it's been exaggerated into the final split and it isn't the final split.  ""As everyone knows, the Spice Girls are pursuing their own solo projects but the Spice Girls still exists.  ""It ain't over until it's over and it ain't over."""
158,"Richard Haigh, principal of Coombeshead College, Newton Abbot, Devon, has criticised ""hysterical"" stereotyping of 'hoodie' wearers as thugs.  ""Most young people are fine, upstanding citizens, and some of them wear hoodies. Why should they be tarred with this rather hysterical brush?"" he said.  This was part of a new code of conduct for visitors aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour at the complex.  ""It's the behaviour that's the problem, not the clothing,"" Mr Haigh said on Thursday.  He added: ""If you know how young people's minds work, the best way of encouraging them to do something is to ban it.  Hooded tops have been part of the uniform at Coombeshead College, a 1,600-strong media and arts college, for two years.  Between 10 and 15% of students wear them, the headmaster estimated.  They are only allowed to put up the hoods when it is raining.  In a letter that he described as ""tongue in cheek"" to the Times on Wednesday, Mr Haigh wrote: ""I am disappointed by the lack of subtlety in dealing with the hoodie problem.  ""Follow our example and make them part of school uniform. How uncool does that make them?"""

Or you can personally contact our Bollywood film specialist, Manish Gajjar, who maintains our Bollywood section at BBC Shropshire: manish.gajjar@bbc.co.uk  After being enthralled by super heroes like Superman, Batman, Spiderman and Harry Potter, it was high time that Indian films entered into the arena of science fiction and technical wizardry - and Krrish does just that! Taking off from where Koi Mil Gaya left off, Krrish opens with the late Rohit's son Krishna being taken care off by his grandmother, Rekha. Rekha soon realises that Krishna too has the super powers that an alien had passed onto her son Rohit. Fearing exploitation at the hands of the evil and selfish ones, she takes a super intelligent and powerful Krishna away from human civilization - somewhere unknown. Krishna grows up amongst the plants, trees animals, fishes and mountains but soon realises that his super powers also make him stand out among his friends, often alienating him. He yearns for a normal life, not one where he can fly and run faster than any bird or animal. At this point in time, enters Priya (Priyanka Chopra), an adventure tourist from Singapore. Krishna saves her life and falls in love with her. Priya leaves for Singapore, but using her false charms, lures Krishna for exploitation on a television show. But Krishna, who goes to Singapore, refuses to swallow the bait. Slowly, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Krishna, uses his powers to save people during a circus performance. He hides his true identity by using a a mask - the masked man becomes known as Krrish to the Singapore population. But thats not where this action packed film ends. Krrish discovers that his father has been destroyed by the evil, megalomaniac Dr. Arya (Naseerudin Shah), a scientist who wants to control human destiny. So the final forty minutes or so of the film revolve around the clash between evil and good. The film has excellent special effects, on par with the best from Hollywood. Of the cast, Hritik lives and breathes his role, displaying helplessness, anger, determination and romance with equal versatility.Here indeed, is an actor par excellence. Priyanka supports well while Rekha and Naseerudin are ever dependable. The music, except for the Dil Na Diya song, is mundane. The film, which is already proving to be one of the biggest money-spinners, not only in the UK cinemas but also around the world, is too good to miss."
160,"Celtic were always chasing the game after Brandao pounced on a John Kennedy mistake to fire the Ukrainian side ahead after just four minutes.  The Scots lost Lee Naylor and Kennedy to injury, but Jiri Jarosik blasted in an equaliser just before half time.  And Donati turned the ball home via a deflection in stoppage time.  It puts Celtic second in the Group D table ahead of Shakhtar, who must hope that they beat Benfica while Celtic lose away to AC Milan in the final games.  Artur Boruc and Paul Hartley had both survived late fitness tests to return to the Celtic side after missing Saturday's win over Aberdeen.  Mark Brown and Donati dropped out, but the Italian midfielder was forced into the action after just 14 minutes following an injury to left-back Lee Naylor.  By then, Celtic were a goal behind following a nightmare start similar to when Shakhtar won the previous group game in Ukraine 2-0.  Kennedy mistimed his attempt at heading clear a long ball out of the Shakhtar defence, it struck Brandao and fell kindly for the striker to fire into the far corner of the net off the exposed Boruc's despairing hand.  That early success appeared to justify Shakhtar coach Mircea Lucescu's decision to go with two up front, matching Celtic manager Gordon Strachan's desire to go all out for a vital three points.  Shaktar were without Nery Castillo after a fall-out with Lucescu after the Mexican midfield playmaker defied orders not to take a penalty.  And, although the early goal visibly rocked Celtic's confidence, the home side began to take control of midfield and Scott McDonald fired just over from 20 yards, while a head flick from Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink drifted just wide.  But Shakhtar remained dangerous and Darijo Srna's 22-yard drive flew just a foot wide and Boruc relied on his instincts to turn a Brandao header from just six yards over the bar.  Celtic's chances appeared to take a further blow after 40 minutes, when Kennedy - not long back from serious injury - was stretchered off, with Steven Pressley making his first appearance of the season following back surgery.  However, a long ball out of defence from Gary Caldwell caused havoc in the Shakhtar defence and, when Razvan Rat and Dmytro Chygrynsky collided, Jarosik pounced to blast the ball into far corner.  The Czech midfielder ought to have grabbed himself a second goal in the closing seconds of the half but sent his diving header wide from five yards following a fine Aiden McGeady cross.  Celtic continued to press after the break, but chances were hard to come by and Jarosik was first to threaten with a glancing header just over the bar.  Just when it looked like it would end advantage to Shakhtar, Donati fired into the far corner from a McGeady cross to set Celtic Park alight.  Celtic: Boruc, Caldwell, Kennedy (Pressley 41), McManus, Naylor (Donati 16), McGeady, Scott Brown, Hartley, Jarosik, McDonald, Vennegoor of Hesselink (Killen 79).   Subs Not Used: Mark Brown, Zurawski, Sno, Caddis."
161,"Changing priorities has seen BP move its focus away from its green branding    Environmental groups have accused BP of dropping its pledge to be green and replacing it with a commitment to be ""responsible"". The oil giant was widely recognised as the first oil company to both acknowledge and tackle climate change. Also, its in-house carbon trading scheme - built with a little help from an unlikely ally, the US-based Environmental Defense Fund - was among the first of its kind. However, a change of chief executive has led to an apparent change of policy. In April, CEO Tony Hayward announced that safety was the company's ""number one priority"". Some environmental groups saw this as an attempt to move away from ""green"" as a brand value, which was introduced by Mr Hayward's predecessor, Lord Browne. Greenpeace said the oil giant had a lot to gain by dropping its promise to be green. Charlie Kronick, Greenpeace's senior climate change adviser, suggested that the pledge was the only thing holding it back from making further cuts to its green credentials. ""Now that BP is blissfully released from its pledge to invest in clean energy, it has a carte blanche to sell off its unprofitable green energy arm,"" he told the BBC. ""It can get back to doing what it does best: being a 100% fossil fuels train wreck,"" Mr Kronick added. ""This is classic smoke and mirrors."" BP denies that it is back-tracking on its commitments to climate change. ""The change represents an evolution and expansion of green as a brand value rather than a replacement,"" said spokesman David Nicholas. ""The new brand value, 'Responsible', encompasses BP's original aspirations towards the environment, in addition to other key areas such as safety and social welfare,"" he explained. ""Our aspirations remain absolutely unchanged: no accidents, no harm to people and no damage to the environment."" Tom Woollard, a director at environmental consultancy ERM, which counts BP as one of its clients, is inclined to agree. Lord Browne re-positioned BP as an energy, not petroleum, company ""I don't think BP has taken a step backwards on being green,"" he told the BBC. ""The people I know who work at BP are still as committed as ever to upholding green values, despite the change."" However, BP's low-key roll-out of the new brand values does mark the end of an era. Lord Browne's re-branding in 2000 promised that the company would move ""Beyond Petroleum"" by finding cleaner ways to generate energy, and listed ""performance-driven, innovative, progressive and green"" as its brand attributes. Britain's green energy sector flourished, as Lord Browne's shining for solar power went head-to-head with rival oil giant Shell's investment in wind projects. Both oil titans lavished huge quantities of money on slick green advertising campaigns. But Rita Clifton, chief executive of brand specialists Interbrand, said high-profile promotions could be a double-edged sword. ""You can't promise in an advert what you aren't delivering on a day-to-day basis and not expect a backlash,"" she told the BBC. The company focused its attention on solar energy And the backlash was fierce: campaigners demanded to know what exactly was green about being responsible for a massive oil spill on Alaska's North Slope""; investing in the extraction of oil from tar sands (described by campaigners as ""global warming's greatest crime""), and spending less than 1.5% of its budget on solar power. BP's environmental credentials suffered a further setback in 2008 when the company announced its intention of withdrawing financial support for a scheme that monitored mangroves next to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant it was constructing in Papua, South-East Asia. ""Withdrawal of BP's support for the monitoring process goes against all the green rhetoric that is so prominent in BP's public relations and marketing exercises,"" campaigners at TAPOL, Down to Earth and a number of other human rights organisations wrote in a letter to BP CEO Tony Hayward. Paul Barber, a TAPOL spokesperson, says that BP has also broken its promise to reinject the carbon dioxide which will escape into the atmosphere from the gas field. ""About 12% of the gas field is carbon dioxide, which will now be vented directly into the atmosphere because BP has backtracked on its promise to institute carbon capture and storage at the Tangguh gas field,"" Mr Barber told BBC News. BP's tone changed in 2008 when Tony Hayward, who replaced Lord Browne in 2007, intimated that he was looking to ""monetise BP's Alternative Energy Business"". The company was unlikely to appease its fiercest critics And BP recently pulled clean out of Britain's green energy sector, cutting investment in renewable energy by 30%, and cutting its solar power workforce by a quarter. Time for a new look then? And if so, what? BP has rebranded itself as ""responsible"" in order to regain the trust it lost following the 2005 Texas City explosion, which killed 15 people and injured more than 170 others. The incident was described as ""one of the worst industrial accidents in the history of the US"" by ERM's Tom Woollard. It led to a record fine of more than $21m by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It also resulted to BP picking up the nickname ""Big Problems"", and the episode ""seriously shook BP's bond of trust with investors"", says Rita Clifton. Tony Hayward has worked hard to regain the public's trust by improving the safety of BP's operations. In April, he announced that safety was the firm's ""number one priority"". ""A new brand value is BP's way of saying that safety is now a top priority,"" Mr Woollard explained. ""It's a promise to potential partners that another Texas City is not on the cards,"" he added. It would be easy to jeer at BP for casting off what many have always considered to be a half-heartedly green mantle. But is it any wonder that BP is reverting to its old habits, given the scepticism with which campaigners greet the green shoots of green thinking in the senior management of oil companies? When confronted with the prospect of sneering green groups, it could well be that any oil company toying with the idea of experimenting with green initiatives - beyond the near term interests of their shareholders - will think twice. And anyway, as Lord Browne outlined in a recent speech at Cardiff University, perhaps saving the world should not be left to the oil companies. If the world could not incentivise green behaviours using good ol' capitalism, Lord Browne noted, it had to be accomplished via legislation, if it can be done at all.     "
162,"Manchester United have become the first English club to win the European Cup beating Portuguese side Benfica by four goals to one.  Ten years after the Munich air crash, which killed eight of Matt Busby's young team, Manchester United have reached the pinnacle of European football.  Celtic became the first Scottish and British club to win the cup the previous year.  United's star player, George Best, was named European Footballer of the Year - just a fortnight after being named the football writers' Footballer of the Year.  Tonight's match at Wembley was watched by a crowd of 100,000 and an estimated 250 million TV viewers. It was the biggest television audience since the World Cup final two years before.  As both teams wear red kit, United opted to play in their blue away strip for the game.  The first half passed in a flurry of fouls before Bobby Charlton headed the opening goal in the second half to make it 1-0.  With only 10 minutes left to go, Benfica scored the equaliser - and very nearly won the match when their feared striker Eusebio broke away from Nobby Stiles, the player tasked with marking him, and blasted the ball towards the net.  But it was saved by keeper Alex Stepney and the game went into extra time.  Two minutes into extra time Best put United ahead again, slipping round the keeper and gently tapping it over the line.  It was followed by two more United goals, from 19-year-old Brian Kidd and captain Bobby Charlton, taking the final score to 4-1.  Manager Matt Busby said: ""They've done us proud. They came back with all their hearts to show everyone what Manchester United are made of. This is the most wonderful thing that has happened in my life and I am the proudest man in England tonight.""  Busby was seriously injured in the crash which claimed the lives of his so-called Busby Babes and there was speculation at the time that the club had been so badly damaged it would have to fold.  But they struggled on to complete the 1958/59 season and when Busby returned to the manager's role the following season he began the task of rebuilding the side.  The club won the league in 1965 and 1967, but today's win marks the pinnacle of the club's achievements.  Charlton and Bill Foulkes were the only survivors of the crash who played in today's final."
163,"Seven Manchester United footballers are among 21 dead after an air crash in Munich.  The British European Airways (BEA) plane caught fire shortly after take off this afternoon with 38 passengers and six crew on board.  The footballing world is reeling from the loss of some of its most talented young players - known as the Busby Babes.  Their average age was 24 and they included Roger Byrne - the captain - Mark Jones, Eddie Colman, Tommy Taylor, Liam Whelan, David Pegg and Geoff Bent.  Eight British sports journalists and several club officials have also been killed.  The Queen has said she is ""deeply shocked"" and has sent a message of condolence to the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.  The chartered aircraft was bringing the Manchester United entourage back from a European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia and had stopped at Munich's Riem Airport to refuel.  On the third attempt to take off the plane over-shot the runway, hit a house with its port wing, veered to the right, hit another building and burst into flames.  The fuselage did not catch fire and several crew and passengers went back into the wreckage to rescue the injured.  Team manager Matt Busby was described as being the most seriously hurt and is being given blood transfusions in hospital.  Star striker Bobby Charlton has been treated for slight head injuries.  According to the Chief Executive of BEA, A. H. Milward, there was a heavy snowstorm in Munich and the pilot delayed departure because he was dissatisfied with one of the plane's engines.  This was the first fatal accident for this type of BEA aeroplane, which has carried 2,340,000 passengers on 86,000 flights since it began service in 1952.  The same plane - called Lord Burghley - took the Manchester United entourage out to Belgrade on Monday."
164,"The UK maker of the Nurofen ""specific pain"" range of products has defended their packaging, after an Australian court ordered the products off shelves.  The court said the UK-based Reckitt Benckiser had misled consumers.  It said products marketed to treat specific pains, such as migraine, were identical to one another.  Nurofen said the products had been ""designed to help the consumer easily navigate our range"", particularly in groceries where there was no pharmacy.  ""Consumer research indicates that 9 in 10 people (88%) look for pain relief for a specific type of pain (eg headache, migraine, back pain) and 7 in 10 (71%) say pain-specific packs help them decide which product is best for their needs,"" said Dr Aomesh Bhatt, regulatory and medical affairs director for Nurofen.  ""How to pick the best painkiller""  The products affected by the Australian court order include Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) watchdog had brought the matter to court earlier this year.  The ACCC said the court had found that the firm had ""engaged in misleading conduct in contravention of the Australian consumer law by representing that its Nurofen Specific Pain products were each formulated to treat a specific type of pain, when the products are identical"".  Each product contained the same active ingredient, ibuprofen lysine 342mg.  The ACCC said the products were found to be ""no more effective at treating the type of pain described on its packaging than any of the other Nurofen specific pain products"".  The comission's research also found that in Australia the products were sold for almost double the price of Nurofen's standard product.  The retail price for each of the pain-specific products was also found to be ""significantly higher"" than other comparable products, the ACCC added.  Manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser said the case related only to Australia, and that it was continuing to work with regulators there ""to ensure Nurofen packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements"".  It said the ruling would not be applicable in other countries, including the UK, where it sells Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache in caplets, as well as Nurofen Express Period Pain in soft capsules.  ""As such all Nurofen products remain available and there will be no changes to packaging,"" the company added.  The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for ensuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines including over-the-counter painkillers in the UK.  It said: ""For over-the-counter medicines informative names are permitted to help patients select an appropriate product without input from a healthcare professional.""  It added, that, with regard to '""informative names"" - they are allowed as ""an aid for patients to select the appropriate product without input from a doctor or pharmacist but they can't make misleading medical claims"".  Richard Headland, editor of Which?, said: ""Our research shows many painkilling medicines have exactly the same active ingredients, despite vastly different marketing, packaging and pricing. Our advice to people is to buy cheaper generic medicines wherever possible and, if in doubt, ask a pharmacist.""  The Federal Court of Australia said the products must be taken off Australian shelves within three months.  Reckitt Benckiser said that it would comply with the Australian court order and that it ""did not set out to mislead consumers"".  Reckitt Benckiser makes a vast range of household products, including Nurofen, Dettol and Harpic, among others.  It has been ordered to publish correction notices in newspapers and on its website and to pay the ACCC's court costs.  This story has been amended to clarify that the products in question were different from the standard Nurofen product."
165,"by BBC News Online's Chris Summers An MP, Piara Khabra, has urged the police to redouble their efforts to find the killer of a Sikh newspaper editor assassinated in London five years ago, a crime which could be linked to the Air India bombing in 1985. The murder of Tarsem Singh Purewal, editor of Britain's biggest-selling Punjabi weekly Des Pardes, in Southall, west London may also be linked to the assassination of another Punjabi-language newspaper in Canada in 1998. Tara Singh Hayer, editor of the Indo-Canadian Times, was gunned down at his home in Surrey, British Columbia 10 years after being paralysed by another gunman.       Mr Hayer's son, Dave, told BBC News Online: ""I'm sure the same organisation was behind both deaths, if not the same individual. ""My father and Mr Purewal were good friends and both were investigating the same elements in the Sikh community. He said: ""They are small in number but they are involved in criminal activities, terrorism. They were trying to expose them."" Mr Hayer, whose father was installed in the Canadian Press Hall of Fame last month, said: ""Despite being shot in 1988, he decided to stand up for his community and said 'If they are going to kill me, so be it'."" He said he believed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) might be close to cracking the case and said: ""Hopefully when it is solved, the Purewal case will be looked at again. ""There are so many good, honest British Sikhs who will bring this information to the police. They will be helping the Sikh cause, as well as bringing the criminals to justice.""       Gurbux Singh Virk, editor of Des Pardes, told BBC News Online it appeared the police had closed the file on his predecessor's murder and he said he was ""disappointed"" with their attitude. The roots to both killings seem to lie in Punjabi politics. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent the army in to crush pro-independence Sikhs in the Punjab. But she signed her own death warrant by ordering troops to flush militants out of the sacred Golden Temple in Amritsar. Her assassination, by her Sikh bodyguards, sparked a wave of attacks on Sikhs all over India. In the Punjab supporters of an independent Sikh state - known as Khalistan - massacred many political opponents and non-Sikhs.      The Sikh religion was founded by a Hindu, Guru Nanak, in the 16th century but retains close cultural links with Hinduism. There are 20 million Sikhs worldwide, of whom 9.5 million live in the Punjab, a fertile area of northern India which provides 60% of India's grain. Orthodox adherents are distinguished by long, flowing hair known as kesh - worn in a turban by men; a metal bangle or kkara which they wear; a ceremonial dagger or kirpan carried on the waist; a kangha or comb which they also use; and an under-garment called a kaccha. When Britain quit the sub-continent in 1947 the Punjab was split in half and most Sikhs fled Pakistan to live on the Indian side of the border. But by 1990 India had regained the upper hand in the Punjab and violence fell markedly. Stability was achieved at a price - there were accusations of widespread police brutality and many supporters of Khalistan have only recently been released from detention. Sikhs all over the world have been affected by the trouble back home. There are pro- and anti-Khalistan cliques wherever the Sikh diaspora has taken roots. Britain's most sizeable Sikh community is in the west London suburb of Southall. There are also significant Sikh communities in the United States, South Africa, Malaysia and Canada - 250,000 Sikhs live in British Columbia alone. Mr Purewal, 60, founded Des Pardes (Home and Abroad) in 1965 and the paper tended to take a pro-Khalistan viewpoint during the 1980s and early 1990s but shortly before his death he appeared to have fallen out with certain radical Sikh groups. Kim Bolan, a reporter on the Vancouver Sun newspaper who has covered Sikh politics since 1984, told BBC News Online Mr Purewal had been preparing a series of articles uncovering fraud and other shady practices within the separatist movement. She said Mr Purewal, who had been to several Sikh terror training camps in Pakistan, also knew details of the Air India bombing in 1985, which killed 329 people. Around 8.15pm on Tuesday, 24 January 1995, Mr Purewal was pulling down the shutters outside his office in Southall.       A gunman appeared from nowhere and killed him with a single shot through the chest. Although it took place in a busy street in the middle of the evening, no witnesses came forward and the killer left few clues. Police arrested several people in Birmingham, including Ragbir Singh, editor of another Sikh newspaper, Awaze Quam. He was eliminated from their inquiries, as were the other suspects. The incident room closed down and the killing appeared forgotten. Piara Khabra, Labour MP for Ealing Southall and himself a Sikh, told BBC News Online: ""The police have not been able to get any new information or any evidence whatsoever."" He said he intended to write to the Metropolitan Police to discover the reasons for the failure.       Mr Khabra said: ""I read about cases from 40 years ago being detected, and yet this case seems to be beyond them. I sometimes feel that not much attention is given to these cases if they are members of the ethnic minority community, certainly not as much as for white murders."" Mr Khabra said: ""It does not matter what the motive is, the police should be investigating properly and should find the murderer. ""With Mr Purewal's case, I don't know whether they have given up. There should be no reason to give up."" Jump forward to Wednesday 18 November 1998. Mr Hayer was manouvering himself from his car into his wheelchair when the killer struck. No-one saw the gunman, who chose to strike in the garage, knowing he would be shielded from the close circuit television cameras which police had installed around the house after the 1988 shooting. Corporal Dan Russell, of the RCMP, told BBC News Online: ""It is still an active investigation. We have not charged anybody but we still have leads to follow."" He said Mr Hayer had received several death threats, some of which emanated from political opponents, shortly before his death but it was not clear if they were from his eventual killers. Fingers have been pointed in the direction of two radical Sikh groups. Ms Bolan, who has received death threats herself and had to move out of her Vancouver home after shots were fired at it, said pro-Khalistan groups had been on the retreat on both sides of the Atlantic since the early 1990s. She said Mr Hayer had agreed to be a witness against suspects in the Air India case and much of his evidence was based on information he had received from Mr Purewal. Ms Bolan said: ""Mr Purewal was on the verge of doing a series of articles which were going to embarrass the ISYF and Babbar Khalsa.""       A few days after Mr Purewal was killed a caller claiming to represent a group implicated in the assassination of Mrs Gandhi claimed responsibility for the killing. But there was no way to corroborate the claim. After all, Mr Purewal's death could have had a more banal explanation. Detectives investigating his death unearthed evidence he had been routinely breaking UK law by publishing the name of rape victims in court reports. Court officials were unaware, because they could not read Punjabi. But one theory circulating in Southall was that Mr Purewal was murdered by a hitman hired by a family whose name had been disgraced by the naming of their daughter as a rape victim. Mr Khabra said: ""I'm not concerned about what was the motive, murder is murder and it's the police's duty to find the culprit and the police have to explain why they appear to have given up.""

166,"Michael Portillo is to chair a £55m scheme to help arts organisations develop long-term funding plans.  About 50 organisations are expected to benefit from the grants, which will start at £500,000.  Groups will be able to bid for grants of up to £5m, but will be expected to raise double that amount through the private sector.  The Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will fund the scheme.  The money will be available to arts organisations across the UK, and it is hoped applications can begin to be submitted in early September.  The £55 million is part of a £100 million pledge to support philanthropy.  The funds will be given as an endowment, with the interest used to pay the groups' running costs.  Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who announced the plans during a speech at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, said: ""World class cultural organisations should have world class financial resilience.  ""Michael Portillo is passionate about culture and will bring real wisdom to a process that will start a much-needed change in our approach to cultural fundraising.""  Alan Davey, Chief Executive of Arts Council England, said: ""Arts and heritage endowments will provide a range of opportunities for arts and cultural organisations to build their skills and capacity to fundraise, to match-fund using new ideas and to invest for their long-term health and creativity.""  In December 2010, Mr Hunt announced an £80 million fund to help increase philanthropy. This was made up of £50 million from Arts Council England and £30 million from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).  Mr Hunt announced on Monday that this would be boosted by an additional £20 million Heritage Lottery Fund contribution.  Shadow Culture Secretary Ivan Lewis, said: ""The test of its success will be whether public funding triggers new private giving, which would not otherwise have been raised, and supports arts organisations which currently receive little or no philanthropic support to develop this source of funding.  ""By Mr Hunt's own admission, this fund will do nothing to help organisations currently scaling down activities and struggling to survive as a result of the Conservative-led government's disproportionate cuts to the arts."""
167,"Allan Menzies, 22, claimed that he was ordered to kill Thomas McKendrick by a character in the movie Queen Of The Damned.  He said at the High Court in Edinburgh that he was told he would be rewarded with immortality and become a vampire ""in the next life"".  Mr Menzies said he was visited in his West Lothian home by the female vampire Akasha, who was played in the film by the late US singer Aaliyah.  He was giving evidence on the sixth day of his trial.  Mr Menzies denies killing Mr McKendrick, who he had known since he was four years old, on 11 December last year and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.  The jury has been told that his offer to plead guilty to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility was rejected by the Crown.  Mr Menzies, from Fauldhouse, said Akasha visited him in his bedroom.  ""In general terms, she started off having conversations with me and it ended up that I had basically agreed with her that if I murdered people I would be rewarded in the next life,"" he said.  He said that he believed Mr McKendrick and another friend, Stuart Unwin, wanted to kill him.  ""I heard it in my mind, basically, that the two of them were plotting to kill me,"" he said.  Mr Menzies told the court he had killed Mr McKendrick using a bowie knife, a kitchen knife and a hammer.  But he said his father Thomas and Mr Unwin had been responsible for disposing of the body.  He said he had not told the police about this to protect his father.  Mr Menzies told the court that Akasha had continued to visit him after the killing, but he rejected demands that he kill more people.  He also said the film character had visited him at Carstairs, where he has been a patient for five months.  Mr Menzies said he was ""disappointed"" that there were no other vampires in the state hospital.  Earlier, two psychiatrists said that Menzies was not suffering from a severe mental illness at the time of the attack.  However, that was rejected by consultant forensic psychiatrists Derek Chiswick and Colin Gray.  Dr Chiswick, 58, said he believed Mr Menzies suffered from an ""anti-social personality disorder"".  But he said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he was a paranoid schizophrenic."
168,"He played 345 times for the club and scored 222 goals including three in the 1953 FA Cup ""Matthews"" Final victory over Bolton Wanderers.  The England star remains the only player to score a hat-trick in an FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.  The statue will be unveiled by his widow Jean and former England captain and BBC summariser Jimmy Armfield.  Morty - as he was known - also managed to score 23 goals in 25 England appearances.  The South Shields born centre forward became a a firm favourite with fans.  The statue cost £25,000 to make and was funded by the club, the town council and Blackpool FC fans.  ""Stan was a truly great man in football and also humanitarian terms,"" said statue organiser Chris Hull.  ""His legacy in Blackpool transcends just football as he became an inspirational figure in the local community.  ""The life-size statue was made by local artist Peter Hodgkinson and shows 'Morty' in typical pose - firing another spectacular goal.  ""The statue will be positioned outside Blackpool Football Club's North Stand - which, appropriately, is also known as the Mortensen Stand.""  Jean Mortensen commented: ""I am delighted that the moment has arrived.  ""People have been talking for years about something like this and now the town has delivered and I feel quite emotional.""  The statue was being unveiled at 1800 BST ahead of the Seasiders' Carling Cup game against Hull City."
169,"The council has bought three mini remote-controlled airships which are soon to be launched to look down on the city monitoring criminal activity.  Each has a camera mounted on it, which beams back pictures to a control room.  The Venezuelan capital is regarded as one of the most dangerous cities in Latin America, with gun crime a particular problem.  There were a few strange looks skywards in Caracas as the new mini Zeppelin took to the skies.  Steered by remote control from the ground, the balloon ducked and dived above the buildings, its pilot showing how manoeuvrable the machine can be.  The 15 metre (49 foot) long air ships are emblazoned with government slogans. Written in bright red are the words: ""We watch over you for your security.""  Some might worry that this will be intrusive - a big brother in the skies, spying on people the government wants to watch.  But the man in charge of security in Caracas, Ramon Morales Rossi, played down that idea.  ""It's part of a plan - working with the people, better education, better police officers and better equipment for the police.""  Security, or the lack of it, is a big concern for many here. Caracas is one of the most dangerous cities in Latin America.  The government has stopped publishing crime figures, but last year the UN said that per capita there were more deaths from guns than anywhere else in the world.  Working under the gaze of the balloon, the people I spoke to backed this up.  ""It's good that there's a greater police presence. It's indispensable. Where's there no police presence, there's no security,"" said one. ""Obviously I think this is the right thing to do. But we need as much security on the ground as in the air.""  The eyes in the sky will be controlled from a new base that is being kitted out in the city centre.  Most Caracas residents agree something needs to be done to make the city safer. As they are watched, they will be watching too to see if these hi-tech machines make any difference to their lives."
170,"A thick layer of fog which has covered London for the last three days is spreading all over the country.  Leeds has recorded its highest ever level of sulphur dioxide in the air and pneumonia cases in Glasgow have trebled.  A spokesman for London's Emergency Bed Service said 235 people had been admitted to hospital in the last 24 hours and issued a ""red warning"" to prepare for more patients as thick fog continues to affect public health.  So far 90 people have died since the crisis began and the fog is not expected to lift for another 24 hours.  The Ministry of Health is warning those at most risk, such as sufferers of chest and heart complaints should ""stay indoors and rest as much as possible"".  The ministry's medical advisors said doctors should prescribe masks for vulnerable patients or ""do-it-yourself masks"" such as thick cotton gauze or a scarf around the mouth and nose.  General advice to the public was also issued:  The fog has now spread to 22 counties of England making driving conditions extremely hazardous with visibility varying from zero to 50 yards (45 metres).  Black ice was another danger affecting London, most of the south, East Anglia, the Midlands and Yorkshire, according to the Automobile Association.  One AA spokesman described the icy stretch of road on the A12 near Chelmsford as ""a battlefield"" after a series of minor accidents.  A scene of traffic jams, queues, breakdowns and abandoned cars recalls a picture not seen in this country for ten years when Britain was smother by the so-called Great Smog of 1952 that claimed some 4,000 lives.  Since then the Clean Air Act has been enforced but only dealt with the smoke emissions and not the discharge of sulphur dioxide.  The level of smoke in London's atmosphere today was two and a half times higher than for an average winter day - and the level of sulphur dioxide was seven times higher, according to figures produced by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research."
171,"Sunshine has returned to the capital following four days of dense fog in which London transport was brought to a standstill.  The atrocious conditions led to widespread disruption of rail, road and air services and affected shipping on the River Thames.  As freshening winds and milder temperatures dissipated the fog today London buses and coaches ran normally but still with some delays on the Southern Region railway.  The fog, which began on 5 December, also affected other areas of the south-east, with icy roads causing several road accidents. Ambulancemen and firemen had to walk ahead of their vehicles to reach those in need.  It also spread as far as northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  A cross-channel ferry carrying 300 passengers from Folkestone to Calais was 15 hours late. The ship had to anchor off the French coast, unable to get into port due to poor visibility.  Fog descended on London once again yesterday evening at the end of a relatively clear day.  By 1830 London Transport reported a virtual shutdown of its north-east London service and nearly all buses were out of action.  Only the London Underground was still running, but as buses stopped running once visibility was reduced to a few hundred yards this too became congested.  At Stratford, on the Central Line, 3,000 people queued for tickets.  London Airport was also severely affected - BOAC reported just two departures and four arrivals yesterday. All other flights were diverted to Hurn, near Bournemouth and passengers were taken by train to Waterloo.  The severe weather conditions led to a rise in crime as robbers used the cover of fog to break into houses and shops and attack and steal from Londoners making their way home in the darkness.  The weather even affected cattle brought into Earls Court in preparation for the Smithfield Show.  Farmers spent hours trying to reach the capital and when they finally arrived found many livestock had breathing difficulties. At least one animal died.  There was no escape from the fog inside either, as it seeped into buildings as well as filling the streets.  Last night, the Sadler's Wells threatre had to end a performance of La Traviata after the first act because the auditorium had filled with fog.  The fog also took its toll on several sporting events. A University Association Football due to take place at Wembley was postponed. It is the first time any fixture has been cancelled at the stadium since it opened in 1923.  Most rugby matches were cancelled and no Association Football League matches took place in London."
172,"Dr John Sentamu will take up the post when the University of Cumbria comes into being on 1 August.  Dr Sentamu has been Archbishop of York since 2005 and prior to that he was the Archbishop of Birmingham from 2002.  He has also served for more than 17 years as a parish priest and as chaplain to both a young offenders institute and a Cambridge College.  He said: ""I am deeply honoured to have been appointed to the University of Cumbria.  ""To be part of a university which will reflect the Christian values and the creative traditions on which it was founded is an exciting prospect.  ""I am looking forward to witnessing the flourishing of an academic environment where generosity and inventiveness combine with aspiration to produce a community of hope and learning.""  Dr Sentamu was born and brought up in Uganda and studied theology at Cambridge University before becoming ordained."
173,"Archbishop John Sentamu baptised the new worshippers using a large pool outside the Church of St Michael-le-Belfrey in York.  Hundreds of people watched as Dr Sentamu stood in the water to immerse each of the adults involved.  The outdoor baptism ceremony first took place in 2006 and involves a network of churches across the city.  Church officials said the total immersion during the service represents a person's death of their old life.  By emerging from the water, the service is meant to be symbolic of being reunited with Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday, the day his resurrection is celebrated.  Graham Hutchinson, joint chairman of One Voice York, which organises the religious service, said: ""New life in Jesus Christ is open to everyone, always, but Easter is a great time for people to make that public commitment.  ""The open-air baptisms in the centre of York are a sign that Jesus is alive and with us.""  Before the service there had been concerns from church officials that the severe weather would mean the service would have to be conducted indoors.  A spokesman for the York Diocese said: ""We had the service as planned in the open air.  ""It was well attended."""
174,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, has jumped 13,000ft out of a plane to raise money for families of soldiers injured in Afghanistan. It was Dr Sentamu's second attempt at the parachute jump with the Red Devils display team. His first was cancelled last month because of bad weather. He said: ""I was praying like anybody's business up there. It was an amazing, amazing experience."" The tandem skydive took place at RAF Langar, near Nottingham. The archbishop was joined by businessman Guy Brudenell, who also braved the jump to raise money for the Afghanistan Trust. Both of the men were strapped to a member of the Red Devils parachute team while free falling for 45 seconds before their parachutes opened at 5,000ft. Dr Sentamu's second attempt to jump was a success Dr Sentamu, 58, said: ""When I was standing at the door (to the plane) I said 'This is it, it's the point of no return.' ""It was fantastic. We were at 13,000ft and then we free-falled for 35 seconds. It happened very quickly and then the man I was with started spinning around. It was absolutely exhilarating."" During the fall, two members of the Red Devils joined them mid-air for a mini-display routine and had orange smoke streaming from canisters strapped to their legs. Moments after landing in a sitting-down position, the Archbishop held his hands in the air to signal he was OK. He then took his helmet off and was given a hand up by a member of the Red Devils to have his photograph taken and a final take for the mid-air video that was filmed during his jump. L/Cpl Lee Read, who jumped in tandem with the Archbishop, said: ""Dr Sentamu was a very good student. ""He was very calm on board the flight, although he didn't say a great deal. The jump went very well."" Asked why he did the jump, Dr Sentamu said: ""It's important for citizens of this country to value those who risk their lives for the sake of this country so I'm doing my part."""
175,"Dr John Sentamu made the symbolic protest gesture live on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show.  He said Mr Mugabe had ""taken people's identity"" and ""cut it to pieces"", prompting him to do the same.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown has boycotted an EU-Africa summit because of Mr Mugabe's presence.  Although Mr Mugabe is banned from the EU, African leaders demanded the Zimbabwean leader be invited to attend the event in Portugal.  Ahead of the summit, the African Union chairman, Ghanaian President John Kufuor, said it was right to invite Mr Mugabe.  ""Africa is made up of 54 nations, sovereign states, and I don't think any of us has the right to exclude another,"" Mr Kufuor told the BBC.  He added: ""All the presidents of Africa were invited to this summit because we see it as a meeting of two continents, Europe and Africa.  ""If we allow anyone - I wouldn't say even a nation, but an individual, whatever we think of him - to be a stumbling block then I say it's unfortunate.""  The summit is being used to agree joint policy aims in areas such as security, development and good governance.  Dr Sentamu - who has been a consistent critic of Mr Mugabe's regime - said the international community, especially South Africa, had to act to help Zimbabwe because people were starving.  Speaking as he used a pair of scissors to cut up his collar, he said: ""As an Anglican this is what I wear to identify myself, that I'm a clergyman.  ""Do you know what Mugabe has done? He's taken people's identity and literally, if you don't mind, cut it to pieces. This is what he's actually done to a lot of - and in the end there's nothing.  ""So, as far as I'm concerned, from now on I'm not going to wear a dog collar until Mugabe is gone.""  The archbishop said power had gone to the Zimbabwean president's head and the leader did not seem to ""realise the suffering of people"".  Ahead of the Lisbon summit, key former Portuguese colonies in Africa, including the large and oil-rich nation of Angola, made it clear to Portugal, that they wanted Mr Mugabe to attend.  Some African leaders see Mr Mugabe as an historically important colleague and object to the idea former colonial powers, such as the UK, intervening in African politics.  But Dr Sentamu hit out at African leaders for not taking a stand against him.  ""It is African leaders who seem to say 'we are backing a revolutionary'. I'm sorry, that is a lot of nonsense. They ought to realise what he has actually done.  ""It has become a scourge on the conscience of the whole of world.""  ""Why aren't we, as a world community, uniting against Mugabe?"" he asked.  Only one in five of Zimbabwe's adult population has a job and basic items such as bread, sugar, petrol are often not available in local shops."
176,"Jim Morris, head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said he expected food aid to reach almost all survivors within the next seven days.  More than 150,000 people have been killed across Asia. The UN has warned that the toll could rise further as a result of hunger and disease.  But no major outbreaks have been reported so far.  The BBC's Matt Frei says officials in a number of refugee camps in Sri Lanka have told him that disease is being contained and people are recovering.  The WFP head told the BBC that aid had reached ""nearly everyone who has been harmed by the disaster"".  ""Through our partners, a good many NGOs, we've found ways to get food to everyone who's in need,"" he said.  He said the agency was feeding 750,000 people in Sri Lanka, and up to 150,000 in Indonesia - primarily in Aceh province, the worst-hit by the earthquake and the tsunami on 26 December.  ""Our job is to get food to people to save lives, to address the special nutritional issues relating to women who are pregnant, nursing, and to young children.""  Mr Morris said he was optimistic the agency would have everything it needed - an estimated $280m ""for food for the next six months, to feed two million people, and for the logistics transport component"".  Food distribution to Indonesia, the worst-hit country, is expected to speed up following the opening of a humanitarian air hub at Subang near the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Friday.  It takes almost twice as long to reach the hard-hit province of Aceh from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, as it does from Subang."
177,"Traditional knowledge handed down from generation to generation helped to save ancient tribes on India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands from the worst of the tsunami, anthropologists say.  But other isolated communities who moved to the islands from South East Asia centuries ago fared far worse than the indigenous peoples, evidence suggests.  The aboriginal tribes - some of the oldest and most isolated in the world - have oral traditions apparently developed from previous earthquakes that may have allowed them to escape to higher ground before the massive tsunami struck the island chain off Indonesia.  The Onge tribe, for example, have lived on Little Andaman for between 30,000 and 50,000 years and, though they are on the verge of extinction, almost all of the 100 or so people left seem to have survived the 26 December quake and the devastating waves which followed.  Their folklore talks of ""huge shaking of ground followed by high wall of water"", according to Manish Chandi, an environmental protection worker who has studied the tribes and spoke to some Onges after the disaster.  ""When the earthquakes struck, the Onges moved to higher ground deep inside their forest and escaped the fury of the waves that entered the settlements,"" he told the BBC News website after talking to some of the inhabitants who knew some Hindi as well as their own ancient languages.  He said another aboriginal people - the Jarawa on South and Middle Andaman - also fled to higher ground before the waves.  ""There's clear evidence that the aboriginals know about tsunamis and they know how to deal with them,"" he said.  Samir Acharya, convenor of the Society for Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (Sane), said the aboriginals have a collective memory of earthquakes and tsunamis so they knew to move to higher ground.  Madhusree Mukherjee, author of The Land of the Naked People, supported the theory, saying: ""The aboriginals have an island survival strategy that they have developed through the knowledge of the generations.""  Anthropologists and government officials compared notes on the tribes' behaviour after the huge undersea earthquake that triggered the Indian Ocean tsunami that is now known to have killed more than 200,000 people in the region.  KC Ghoshal, executive secretary of the Andaman-Nicobar tribal welfare department, spoke to some of the Great Andamanese people taken to a rest house near the islands' capital, Port Blair.  He said the survivors spoke of feeling the earth shake and bringing their thatched huts crashing down, prompting an exodus to higher ground.  ""We can now say we have contacted or carefully assessed the plight of the aboriginals and we can say almost of them are safe,"" he said, adding that officials hoped to return those taken to temporary shelters in the immediate aftermath.  ""They have been much harassed by the media and we plan to send them back to their areas without much delay,"" Mr Ghoshal said.  Mr Chandi, who travelled to the affected areas as part of a team assessing the tsunami's environmental impact, said his research showed the Onges living at Dugong Creek and South Bay on Little Andaman Island were also almost wholly safe.  He added that the Jarawa tribe along the west coast of South and Middle Andaman Islands was also largely safe.  Most of the Jarawas appeared to be deep in the jungles, hunting wild boar, and staying away from the beaches where they would usually catch turtles - another favoured food.  Further afield, the Sentinelese people appear not to have been affected, Mr Ghoshal said.  ""They continued to remain isolated and even shot arrows at a naval helicopter on patrol which had descended on the North Sentinel island to check,"" he said.  There are some concerns for the Shompens, the last of the islands' five groups that are considered native, though some say they may have originated in Africa.  The Shompens live inland and deep in the forest, and the government's tribal welfare department is not sure how many, if any, casualties they suffered.  ""A helicopter that hovered over their habitat seems to have scared them and they have fled into very dense jungles. So it will be a while before a clear assessment will emerge,"" Mr Ghoshal said.  But research on the more southern Nicobar part of the archipelago suggests that tribes who were not indigenous to the islands fared far less well.  Thousands of Nicobarese, who some say migrated from South East Asia 500 or 600 years ago, are dead or missing. Many of their islands suffered more in the huge waves - in some cases being washed off the horizon entirely.  And even those who survived face more dangers along with their aboriginal fellow island dwellers - partly because of the renewed interest in them from outside.  Andaman health expert Tilak Bera, an Indian navy doctor with close knowledge of the aboriginals, said: ""They can cope with tsunamis but they will find it difficult to cope with disease that the settlers have brought to the islands.  ""I am sure they have tided themselves over the tsunami with their collective knowledge but I am apprehensive about diseases that may afflict them because of the exposure to outsider society and unfamiliar food they had to eat after displacement.""  It may yet be a sad repetition of history for the tribespeople.  In the 19th Century - when the last massive earthquake struck the Indian Ocean - many thousands died in measles, pneumonia and cholera epidemics when they came into contact with outsiders."
178,"The arrival of spring across Europe heralded the annual series of tough and lengthy one-day 'Classics' - races which pit riders against uneven roads and unpredictable weather.  From a near-300km race across northern Italy, to the mud and cobbles of northern France and the oldest of all in Belgium, the Spring Classics are among the hardest races a professional cyclist face.  In a nutshell: Britain's Geraint Thomas goes for a solo victory on the Poggio but is caught as he reaches the summit and the sprinters take over in the final kilometre. Defending champion Alexander Kristoff leads out the sprint but Degenkolb edges it on the line.  In a nutshell: The 28-year-old makes an audacious attack with 40km to go and only Zdenek Stybar of the Czech Republic keeps pace. Peter Sagan catches up but Thomas drops them both with just over 4km left to prevail by 25 seconds.  In a nutshell: The 38-year-old wins the 239km event in wet and windy conditions, attacking with just under 6km to go and distancing himself from the chasing group of five riders to take victory. Dutch rider Niki Terpstra is second with Geraint Thomas recovering to finish third after being blown into a ditch by a gust of wind.  In a nutshell: The 27-year-old follows Etixx-Quick Step's Niki Terpstra on an attack 25km from the finish and holds off the Dutchman in a sprint finish. Belgian Greg van Avermaet is third, with Britain's Geraint Thomas 14th. Trek's Jesse Sergent and FDJ's Sebastien Chavanel are both knocked off their bikes by team cars.  In a nutshell: In his last race for Team Sky, Sir Bradley Wiggins attacks hard in the final 40km, but can not stay clear of the peloton. Instead John Degenkolb rides a shrewd race, timing his sprint to perfection in the velodrome, to secure Germany's first victory in the race since 1896. Luke Rowe is the best placed Briton in eighth as Welshman Geraint Thomas fails to finish.  In a nutshell: As always, the race of 34 climbs comes down to the final ascent of the Cauberg. Three-time winner Philippe Gilbert attacks on the 1,200m climb and races clear with Michael Matthews. But the pair are caught in the final kilometre and Kwiatkowski wins the small bunch sprint.  In a nutshell: Belgian Tim Wellens makes a break for the finish but is caught by the peloton and defending champion Valverde is the strongest on the third and final ascent of the formidable Mur de Huy. Britain's Chris Froome is involved in a crash 11km from the finish, although he gets back on his bike and finishes.  In a nutshell: Valverde wins for the third time in his career with a well-timed attack, clinching the Ardennes double after his midweek victory in the Wallonne Arrow."
179,"Contrary to popular belief, the Cuban missile crisis did not end with the agreement between the US and Soviet Union in October, 1962. Unknown to the US at the time, there were 100 other nuclear weapons also in the hands of Cuba, sparking a frantic - and ingenious - Russian mission to recover them.  In November 2011, aware that the 50th anniversary of the most dangerous few weeks in history was less than a year away, my Russian colleague Pasha Shilov and I came across several new accounts that changed our perspective on the Cuban missile crisis and how much we thought we knew about it.  Growing up in Berkshire, England, through the nuclear paranoia of the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan's Cruise and Pershing missiles stationed only 30 miles away from my family home, I was inculcated with a keen awareness of Cold War brinkmanship.  Pasha grew up in Moscow and described how it was from the Soviet point of view - equally frightening by his account.  But what we've now learned about the chilling events of October and November 1962 has put our own experiences into perspective - and maybe given rise to a few more grey hairs along the way.  Our investigations took us to St Petersburg and the Soviet Submariners Veterans' Society via the National Security Archive in Washington DC, where Svetlana Savranskaya, the director of the Russian archives, told us an incredible story.  There had been a second secret missile crisis that continued the danger of a catastrophic nuclear war until the end of November 1962.  This extended the known missile crisis well beyond the weekend of 27-28 October, the time that had always been thought of as the moment the danger finally lifted with the deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev to withdraw the Soviet missiles in exchange for a US promise not to invade Cuba.  The secret missile crisis came about through an unnerving mix of Soviet duplicity, American intelligence failures and the mercurial temperament of Fidel Castro.  The Cuban leader, cut out of the main negotiations between the superpowers over the fate of the long range Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba, began to cease cooperation with Moscow.  Fearing that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions Khrushchev had made to Kennedy, might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the superpowers, the Soviet leader concocted a plan to give Castro a consolation prize.  The prize was an offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles, but which crucially had passed completely under the radar of US intelligence.  Khrushchev concluded that because the Americans hadn't listed the missiles on their list of demands, the Soviet Union's interests would be well served by keeping them in Cuba.  Kremlin number two, Anastas Mikoyan, was charged with making the trip to Havana, principally to calm Castro down and make him what seemed like an offer he couldn't refuse.  Mikoyan, whose wife was seriously ill, took the assignment knowing that the future of relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union were on the line. Shortly after arriving in Cuba, Mikoyan received word that his wife had died, but despite this, he pledged to stay in Cuba and complete negotiations with Castro.  In the weeks that followed, Mikoyan kept the detail of the missile transfer to himself while he witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of the Cuban leader convinced that Moscow had sold Cuba's defence down the river.  Castro particularly objected to the constant flights over Cuba by American surveillance aircraft and, as Mikoyan learned to his horror, ordered Cuban anti-aircraft gunners to fire on them.  Knowing how delicate the state of relations were between the US and Russia after the worst crisis since World War II, US forces around the world remained on Defcon 2, one short of global nuclear war until 20 November.  Mikoyan came to a personal decision that under no circumstances should Castro and his military be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs.  He then extricated Moscow from a seemingly intractable situation which risked blowing the entire crisis back up in the faces of Kennedy and Khrushchev.  On 22 November 1962, during a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan was forced to use the dark arts of diplomacy to convince Castro that despite Moscow's best intentions, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law (which didn't actually exist) to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent.  Finally after Mikoyan's trump card, Castro was forced to give way and - much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government - the tactical nuclear weapons were finally crated and returned by sea back to the Soviet Union during December 1962.  This story has illuminated a chapter in history that has been partially closed for the past 50 years.  But it leaves us with a great respect for Mikoyan and his ability to judge and eventually contain an extremely dangerous situation which could have affected many millions of people.

Unknown to the US at the time, there were 100 other nuclear weapons also in the hands of Cuba, sparking a frantic - and ingenious - Russian mission to recover them.  In November 2011, aware that the 50th anniversary of the most dangerous few weeks in history was less than a year away, my Russian colleague Pasha Shilov and I came across several new accounts that changed our perspective on the Cuban missile crisis and how much we thought we knew about it.  Growing up in Berkshire, England, through the nuclear paranoia of the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan's Cruise and Pershing missiles stationed only 30 miles away from my family home, I was inculcated with a keen awareness of Cold War brinkmanship.  Pasha grew up in Moscow and described how it was from the Soviet point of view - equally frightening by his account.  But what we've now learned about the chilling events of October and November 1962 has put our own experiences into perspective - and maybe given rise to a few more grey hairs along the way.  Our investigations took us to St Petersburg and the Soviet Submariners Veterans' Society via the National Security Archive in Washington DC, where Svetlana Savranskaya, the director of the Russian archives, told us an incredible story.  There had been a second secret missile crisis that continued the danger of a catastrophic nuclear war until the end of November 1962.  This extended the known missile crisis well beyond the weekend of 27-28 October, the time that had always been thought of as the moment the danger finally lifted with the deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev to withdraw the Soviet missiles in exchange for a US promise not to invade Cuba.  The secret missile crisis came about through an unnerving mix of Soviet duplicity, American intelligence failures and the mercurial temperament of Fidel Castro.  The Cuban leader, cut out of the main negotiations between the superpowers over the fate of the long range Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba, began to cease cooperation with Moscow.  Fearing that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions Khrushchev had made to Kennedy, might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the superpowers, the Soviet leader concocted a plan to give Castro a consolation prize.  The prize was an offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles, but which crucially had passed completely under the radar of US intelligence.  Khrushchev concluded that because the Americans hadn't listed the missiles on their list of demands, the Soviet Union's interests would be well served by keeping them in Cuba.  Kremlin number two, Anastas Mikoyan, was charged with making the trip to Havana, principally to calm Castro down and make him what seemed like an offer he couldn't refuse.  Mikoyan, whose wife was seriously ill, took the assignment knowing that the future of relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union were on the line. Shortly after arriving in Cuba, Mikoyan received word that his wife had died, but despite this, he pledged to stay in Cuba and complete negotiations with Castro.  In the weeks that followed, Mikoyan kept the detail of the missile transfer to himself while he witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of the Cuban leader convinced that Moscow had sold Cuba's defence down the river.  Castro particularly objected to the constant flights over Cuba by American surveillance aircraft and, as Mikoyan learned to his horror, ordered Cuban anti-aircraft gunners to fire on them.  Knowing how delicate the state of relations were between the US and Russia after the worst crisis since World War II, US forces around the world remained on Defcon 2, one short of global nuclear war until 20 November.  Mikoyan came to a personal decision that under no circumstances should Castro and his military be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs.  He then extricated Moscow from a seemingly intractable situation which risked blowing the entire crisis back up in the faces of Kennedy and Khrushchev.  On 22 November 1962, during a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan was forced to use the dark arts of diplomacy to convince Castro that despite Moscow's best intentions, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law (which didn't actually exist) to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent.  Finally after Mikoyan's trump card, Castro was forced to give way and - much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government - the tactical nuclear weapons were finally crated and returned by sea back to the Soviet Union during December 1962.  This story has illuminated a chapter in history that has been partially closed for the past 50 years.  But it leaves us with a great respect for Mikoyan and his ability to judge and eventually contain an extremely dangerous situation which could have affected many millions of people.

181,"Up to 700 people were evacuated from London Marylebone station after a fire onboard a train that pulled into a platform.  An air conditioning unit is believed to have caught fire, police said. No injuries were reported.  Light smoke could be seen on the concourse and appeared to be coming from platform one, BBC World Service presenter Danny Cox said.  The station was evacuated shortly after 21:00 GMT and five fire crews were called to the station.  ""There's been nothing but calm from the start"", Mr Cox said.  Chiltern Railways services to the Home Counties and West Midlands have been affected."
182,"Music producer Gus Dudgeon, who produced some of Elton John's biggest hits of the 70s, has died in a car crash aged 59.  Dudgeon was killed on Sunday when his vehicle veered off the M4 between Reading and Maidenhead, and plunged down an embankment.  John was said to be ""devastated"" by the news. ""He was an incredibly talented producer and a dear friend for several years. I will miss him terribly,"" he said on his website.  Dudgeon produced many of the singer's classics tracks, including Your Song, Rocket Man and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.  In an interview in The New York Times, he said, ""We lose everything. We lost the World Cup. We lost Wimbledon. But we do it with grace and style because we're used to it.""  The 69-year-old also suggested that he was hated in the UK because of his overseas success. ""But that's OK,"" he added. ""I'd rather have people hate me than fail.""  Caine stars in the new Austin Powers film Goldmember, which is released in the UK and US on Friday.  Pop Idol runner-up Gareth Gates is celebrating a second week at number one with his latest single.

183,"The M4 bus lane was created by John Prescott The M4 bus lane is hardly being enforced - with only a handful of penalty notices issued to drivers who wrongly use the lane each year. BBC London has learned that just 14 £60 fixed penalty notices were issued in 2008 with just six so far this year. Minicab company Addison Lee - which is not allowed to drive in the lane - has now told its drivers to use it. The 3.5 mile lane on the motorway into west London was launched by then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in 1999. But there are no dedicated cameras watching the bus lane - and the Metropolitan Police have said policing it is not a priority. A spokeswoman said: ""The Met is constantly balancing our aim to improve safety on London's roads with making the most effective use of road policing resources. We've got a bus lane that no-one enforces - what is the point in having it?    ""While officers will enforce non-criminal road traffic offences wherever possible, we will always prioritise resources for activity that can reduce casualties."" Steve McNamara, of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said: ""It's absolutely farcical. We've got a bus lane that no-one enforces - what is the point in having it? ""The world and his mother is using it. It's supposed to be a bus lane - it's anything but, and soon it will be too congested for buses to use."" He added: ""It's actually very dangerous. You can be going down the bus lane at 50mph and someone pulls out from stationary on the inside. ""I've seen untold near misses and it's only a matter of time before someone gets killed - all a matter of lack of enforcement."" Only buses, coaches, motorbikes, emergency vehicles and licensed taxis can use the lane, which runs between Heathrow airport and central London. Journey times improved for all types of traffic in the first three months of the £1.9m lane, according to Transport Research Laboratory figures. But Edmund King, AA president, said: ""At times the M4 bus lane seem like an M4 ghost lane - it is under-used and under-policed. ""Currently it is a white elephant. ""If we can't find ways to make it more efficient perhaps it should be opened to all."" A Highways Agency spokesman said: ""Apart from emergency service vehicles, the only other vehicles allowed to use the lane are buses, licensed taxis and motorcycles. Private hire vehicles are not allowed.""     "
184,"Average speed cameras are being installed on a section of the M4 where a fixed camera was removed eight years ago because it was causing tailbacks.  The new cameras will be installed later this summer within the 50mph zone on the westbound side of the motorway around Port Talbot.  In a separate move, the on-slip road at junction 41 will be closed at peak periods for a six-month trial.  The previous fixed camera was blamed for causing delays of up to five miles.  A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The fixed speed camera near between junctions 41 and 42 of the M4 westbound was removed in 2006 as it was considered to be causing unstable traffic flow which could have contributed to minor collisions.  ""The installation of new average speed cameras in the area are part of a wider package of measures to improve traffic flow.  ""This includes the trial junction closures but the two measures are not directly linked.""  Plans to fully close junction 41 to ease congestion were amended after complaints by traders and now only the on-slip will shut and just at peak periods.  Some local businesses had described the closure plan as detrimental."
185,"Democrat Bill Clinton has won the presidential election to become the 42nd United States president and the first in US history born after World War II. Democrat Bill Clinton has won the presidential election to become the 42nd United States president and the first in US history born after World War II. Aged 46, the Governor of Arkansas will be the third youngest president in US history after John Kennedy and Theodore Roosevelt. There was an unusually high turnout - always good news for Democrats - with an estimated 100 million Americans voting. The president-elect got 43% of the vote to Mr Bush's 38% with Independent Ross Perot trailing behind with 19%. If you will be my voice today, I will speak for you for four years   The Democrats conducted a highly effective campaign pushing aside allegations of Clinton's extra-marital affair with singer Gennifer Flowers and accusations of draft dodging during the Vietnam war. Instead they promised to lift America out of an economic quagmire, a message that has obviously won favour. Early results showed the Republicans were on their way out when their usual strongholds of Vermont and New Hampshire fell to their rivals. Democrats then began slicing into southern states like Georgia. Mr Perot has not won a single state despite spending an estimated $60m of his own money on his campaign. Clinton and his running mate Al Gore spent the last few weeks of the campaign on a whistle-stop bus tour of America. At dawn today they were at a rally in Denver, Mr Clinton's voice hoarse from speech-making. ""I have just about lost my voice,"" he said. ""If you will be my voice today, I will speak for you for four years."" He began the campaign more than a year ago with little hope of winning against President Bush whose popularity was high on the back of the Gulf War victory. But since then the economy has taken a serious turn for the worse and with it President Bush's standing in the eyes of US citizens. In his victory speech at Little Rock, Arkansas, Mr Clinton thanked his wife, Hillary, who stood by him during the Flowers sex scandal. He said the American people had voted for a ""new beginning"" and promised to tackle issues such as Aids, the environment and ""the conversion of our economy from a defence to a domestic economic giant"". He also paid tribute to President Bush for helping to bring an end to the Cold War and a victory in the Gulf War. It was an historic day for Congress too - the first black woman, Democrat Carol Moseley Braun, was elected to the Senate.     Among his successes as president were the Oslo accord between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993, the Dayton peace accord signed in former Yugoslavia in 1995, and the Northern Ireland ceasefire. At home he carried through major welfare reforms. But his first term was tainted by the Whitewater real estate scandal that questioned the Clintons' involvement in an Arkansas land deal dating back to 1978. They were only cleared of wrongdoing in 2000. Thanks to a booming economy, President Clinton comfortably won a second term against his Republican challenger, Bob Dole in 1996. His second term was dogged by the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal which he first vehemently denied and then admitted in a televised speech to the Grand Jury . After Kenneth Starr's report into Bill Clinton was published in September 1998, the House Judiciary Committee decided to impeach him and he became only the second president in American history to face such an indictment, but he refused to resign. His trial ended on 12 February 1999 when senators voted to acquit him of the impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.   "

188,"Well-organised Australia were relentless in their tackling of Barbarians Australia's superb defence was the springboard for a hard-fought win over a star-studded Barbarians side in the Olympic Centenary match at Wembley. The Wallabies withstood strong early pressure for Ryan Cross to create a 12th-minute try for Lote Tuqiri. Teenage debutant James O'Connor kicked available points but a mistake let Shane Williams set up Jerry Collins for a second-half Barbarians score. But Australia sealed victory with a brilliant Lachie Turner try late on. The result means Australia go home having won four of their six tour matches, beating Italy, England and France but losing to New Zealand and Wales. The match was organised as part of the British Olympic Association's celebrations of the centenary of the first Olympics in London, where the Games will return in four years' time. Australia took the rugby union gold medal in 1908 with a 32-3 victory over Great Britain, represented by the English county of Cornwall. In honour of that match, the Barbarians all wore yellow Cornwall socks as they departed from their usual tradition of players wearing their club socks. Modern professional rugby has made the Baa-Baas a bit of a sideshow but it's still an honour to play for them as judging by the selection of the high quality team    In the ninth minute, Springbok wing Bryan Habana, one of seven members of South Africa's World Cup-winning side in the Barbarians' starting XV, broke clear and chipped ahead. Illustrating Australia's alertness and strength in defence, his kick was fielded near Australia's line by Lote Tuqiri who, despite pressure from New Zealand captain Richie McCaw, grounded the ball for a five-metre scrum. Minutes later Tuqiri, making his first start since knee surgery after this year's Tri-Nations, opened the scoring after wing Cross burst down the right touchline from deep in his own half and his clever cross-kick inside was gathered up by Tuqiri, who strolled in under the posts. Full-back O'Connor added the conversion on what was his first start for the Wallabies and the 18-year-old soon stretched Australia's lead to 13-0 with a couple of penalties. The Barbarians, with South Africa lock Bakkies Botha a powerful presence, did start to gain ground and were rewarded with two penalties from Percy Montgomery - the Springboks' record points scorer. Habana and All Black wing Joe Rokocoko caught the Wallabies cold with a neat exchange of passes which took the Barbarians to within sight of the try-line, while Samoa prop Census Johnston and Botha both went close with referee Chris White calling on the video referee. But, with the television pictures proving inconclusive, no try was awarded. Tuqiri's early try gave Australia crucial momentum on which to build On the hour, former Australia captain George Gregan came off the Baa-Baas' bench to face his compatriots and, soon after, Australia outside-half Quade Cooper's poor kick out of defence gave possession back to the Barbarians. Francois Steyn, playing at outside-half, threw a long cut-out pass to Wales wing Williams, on as a half-time replacement for Montgomery, who sprinted clear down the touchline to take several Australians out of the game. He then put a well-timed pass inside to All Black flanker Collins, who went over for the try, but Steyn missed the conversion and then pushed a penalty wide of the posts with eight minutes left. Victory was sealed two minutes from time by replacement Turner's breakaway try after Steyn, who missed two goalkicks, was turned over. Worryingly for Australia, props Matt Dunning, who exited on a stretcher, and Sekope Kepu both went off early in the second-half after the Barbarians demolished a Wallaby scrum."
189,"Because of the Michelin tyre safety row the only cars on the starting grid were those of Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi.  Rubens Barrichello took second, despite being shunted onto the grass by Schumacher after his 51st lap pit-stop, to give Ferrari 18 championship points.  Tiago Monteiro and Narain Karthikeyan, Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher took up the other places.  Schumacher's first victory of the season saw him earn a valuable 10 points in the world championship standings, to move to third place in the table on 34 points, behind leader Fernando Alonso and second placed Kimi Raikkonen.  Barrichello's eight points saw him rise to fourth in the standings.  But many fans did not stay to see the outcome of the race, choosing instead to leave early.  Missiles were thrown onto the circuit during the race, and the cars crossed the finishing line to shouts of derision from spectators.  While the Jordan team celebrated Monteiro's podium place enthusiastically, after the race Schumacher was somewhat restrained in his reaction.  ""It was a bit of a strange Grand Prix, it's not the right way to win my first race of the year, but to have one win out of 84 being like this isn't too bad,"" he said.  ""Obviously I would have wished to fight the race under normal circumstances.  ""I think we had a good car so I think we had a very fair chance to fight for the victory.""  But it was a hollow victory and left many questioning F1's future in America."
190,"A Colombian passenger plane crashed and broke up as it came into land on an island in the Caribbean, injuring at least 119 people, officials have said.  One person died, apparently from a heart attack - officials said others were ""scattered"" over the runway.  The Boeing 737 was carrying 131 passengers and crew when it tried to land on the island of San Andres.  The passenger jet, operated by local airline Aires, was reportedly hit by lightning before it crashed.  It had flown from the Colombian capital, Bogota.  Col David Barrero from the Colombian Air Force said reports suggested the plane had crashed at 0149 (0649 GMT) on Monday and that ""the skill of the pilot kept the plane from colliding with the airport"".  At least 16 non-Colombian nationals were reported to have been on the plane, from countries including the US, Brazil, Costa Rica and France.  A police statement said the plane's fuselage had broken up into three pieces and that passengers were ""literally scattered over the end of the runway"".  The island's police chief, Col Hector Paez, said an 11-year-old girl who had been trapped beneath seats on the aircraft was among those severely injured.  The pilot reported that the plane was struck by lightning, Donald Tascon, deputy director of Colombia's aeronautics authority, said.  ""We are inspecting the remains of the plane to try to establish what the damages were and what caused the accident,"" he told Reuters news agency.  Of 99 passengers taken to the Amor de Patria Hospital on San Andres, only four suffered major injuries according to the hospital director, Dr Robert Sanchez.  The woman who died is thought to have died from a heart attack, Dr Sanchez told Reuters.  Passengers said the plane had appeared to be landing normally before suddenly losing control.  ""I felt an impact. My seat was knocked loose but I was able to unbuckle myself and get two of my daughters out,"" Heriberto Rua was quoted by Reuters as saying.  ""We all felt the plane was arriving very, very quickly on the tarmac,"" 28-year-old French passenger Virginie Giroux told the AFP news agency.  ""We did not feel the contact with the ground. We just saw everything flying, everything bursting in the plane.""  Another passenger, Ricardo Ramirez, said the accident had ""appeared out of nowhere"".  ""We tried to get out of the plane because it was starting to shoot flames. In a few minutes, a police patrol arrived and helped us,"" he told the Associated Press.  San Andres Governor Pedro Gallardo described it as a ""miracle"" that so many survived.  ""We have to give thanks to God,"" he said, and praised rescue workers for their ""fantastic"" response.  San Andres Island, about 190km (120 miles) east of the Nicaraguan coast, is a popular tourist destination."
191,"Chance, a Brahman bull, died earlier this year, but scientists at Texas A&M University, US, have created a clone using skin cells taken shortly before he died. The floppy-eared calf is called Second Chance.  ""What is the limit?"" asked researcher Mark Westhusin. ""Do the cells reach a certain age where you can't clone them anymore or does that ever happen?""  Professor Westhusin said Chance was chronologically equivalent to an 88-year-old human when he died of old age. He was owned by Ralph and Sandra Fisher of La Grange, Texas who used him in their photography and television business, allowing people to be pictured riding bulls.  On seeing Second Chance, Mr Fisher said: ""The hair stood up on the back of my neck - he has the same markings as Chance.""  Another team member, Jonathan Hill said: ""The Fishers wanted to have their prized bull cloned because of his unusually gentle nature, and they considered the cloning effort a good opportunity to see if an identical copy of Chance might also have such an easy going disposition.""  Chance was unable to reproduce naturally because of the removal of both diseased testicles two years ago.  Second Chance, born three weeks ago, will stay at Texas A&M until he is weaned in another six months and then go join the Fishers' photography business. However, scientists will continue to keep a close watch for any signs of premature ageing.  ""The chromosomes, which package the animal's DNA, have some special DNA at their tips called telomeres,"" Dr Hill explained. ""These small pieces of DNA help to protect chromosomes from damage.  ""Very young animals have long telomeres, but as the animal ages, the telomeres are worn away. We should know in a month or so if the telomeres of Second Chance are like those of the 21-year-old bull used as the source of the cells for the cloning process, or if they are more like those of a normal new-born calf.""  Second Chance, like previously cloned calves, displayed some early symptoms similar to those seen in premature human babies. However, Second Chance is now in good health, Dr Hill said.  Professor Westhusin also leads the Missyplicity Project which is attempting to produce the first cloned dog. The anonymous sponsors of the project have invested $2.3 million to produce a clone of their pet dog, Missy, a mixed-breed border collie.  The cloning of Second Chance was funded by the Texas Co-ordinating Board of Higher Education's Advanced Research Program and by Ultimate Genetics in Franklin, Texas."
192,"Five genetically identical fruit flies were produced at the lab of Dr Vett Lloyd at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.  They join an expanding menagerie of creature copies that now includes sheep, mice, rats, cows, and even cats.  Fruit flies have long been a ""model"" to study reproductive biology and the team thinks its insects may help science understand why cloning is often flawed.  ""That's pretty much the only reason why you would want to do this,"" Dr Lloyd told BBC News. ""There are more than enough fruit flies in the world.""  The Dalhousie fly clones were produced in a slightly different way to the method made famous with Dolly the sheep.  In that process, the genetic material of the adult animal to be copied was taken from one of its cells and injected into an emptied egg, and then coaxed into becoming a developing embryo.  For the Dalhousie flies, the donor genetic material came not from an adult cell but from an embryo cell.  It is generally thought to be easier to clone this way. Even so, it still took about 800 transfers to produce the five fly copies.  And the abnormalities that blighted many of the copying attempts echoed the problems seen in mammal cloning. Currently, many of the large animal clones that are born experience ill-health and die prematurely.  This acts as a bar to the application of cloning technology in areas that might improve the quality of agricultural livestock or produce useful drug products in animals.  Researchers believe the very low efficiency is due to the injected genetic material failing to properly ""reprogramme"" back to a true embryonic state.  Normal reproduction relies on a key process known as imprinting. This allows only specific copies of genes to be active, depending on whether they come from the male sperm or the female egg.  The Lloyd team intends to investigate this issue with their fly clones.  Flies are relatively easy to experiment with and scientists have a good grasp of their genetics (the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was decoded in 2000).  ""If we can see in flies where the process goes wrong and these genes are conserved in mammals then maybe you could correct it in mammal cloning - but that is a long, long way down the road,"" Dr Lloyd said.  The group's work has now progressed to produce a dozen clones."
193,"Gaza City is the Strip's main administrative and commercial hub    The Gaza Strip is a narrow piece of land along the Mediterranean coast between Israel and Egypt. Just 40km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it is home to more than 1.5 million Palestinians. The shape of the territory was defined by the Armistice Line following the creation of Israel in 1948 and the subsequent war between the Israeli and Arab armies. Egypt administered the Strip for the next 19 years, but Israel captured it during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and Gaza has been under Israeli control since then. Click here to for an enlarged map of the Gaza Strip In 2005, Israel pulled out the troops occupying Gaza, along with thousands of Jews who had settled in the territory. As far as Israel was concerned that was the end of the occupation. However, that has not been accepted internationally as Israel still exercises control over most of Gaza's land borders, as well as its territorial waters and airspace. Egypt controls Gaza's southern border. In June 2007, the Islamist militant group Hamas took over the strip, ousting the forces of Fatah, the faction led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and effectively splitting Gaza from the West Bank in terms of its administration. Hamas had won legislative elections in January 2006. Gaza City is the Strip's biggest population centre and has about 400,000 inhabitants. As in other towns in Gaza, there are high levels of poverty, deprivation and unemployment in Gaza City. It was the scene of frequent deadly clashes between gunmen from the rival Hamas and Fatah factions. Under Hamas rule, law and order in the strip improved, though Hamas security forces have been accused of abuses. Over the years, Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. Gaza's other two main population centres are Khan Younis (population 200,000) in central Gaza and Rafah (population 150,000) in the south. The majority of Gaza's residents are from refugee families which fled or were expelled from the land that became Israel in 1948. Most Gazans live in eight refugee camps to which the United Nations delivers health, education and other humanitarian services. Some of the camps have merged with nearby towns, while others such as Nuseirat and Bureij are self-contained. The influx of refugees into the narrow strip of land means it now has one of the highest population densities on earth. About 20% of refugee dwellings are not connected to the sewage system and waste water flows in open channels along roads. The camp population in Gaza, according to the UN, are: Jabaliya (106,691), Rafah (95,187), Shati (78,768), Nuseirat (57,120), Khan Younis (63,219), Bureij (28,770), Maghazi (22,266), Deir al-Balah (19,534). Israel has for many years restricted entry to and exit from Gaza, but it intensified its blockade of Gaza in June 2007, when Hamas took over. The aim has been to isolate Hamas and to pressure it to stop militant rocket fire. Since, the strip's population have been relying on less than a quarter of the volume of imported supplies they received in December 2005. At times, significantly less than that has gone into the strip, causing severe shortages. Only basic humanitarian items have been allowed in, and virtually no exports permitted, paralysing the economy. In the wake of the Hamas takeover, Israel said it would allow only basic humanitarian supplies into the strip. No specific list of what is and is not classed as humanitarian exists, although aid agencies say permitted items generally fall into four categories - human food, animal food, groceries (cleaning products, nappies etc) and medicines. In September 2007, the Israeli government declared the Strip a ""hostile entity"" in response to continued rocket attacks on southern Israel, and said it would start cutting fuel imports. Fuel shortages and a lack of spare parts have had a heavy knock-on impact on sewage treatment, waste collection, water supply and medical facilities. Israel maintains the blockade has at no point caused a humanitarian crisis - but in early 2008, a group of aid agencies described the situation as exactly that, and the worst situation in the strip since Israel occupied it in 1967. The blockade has been criticised as collective punishment by, among other, the United Nations. An Israeli-built metal fence separates Israel and the Gaza Strip. Along the border are several heavily fortified border crossings for people and goods. They are heavily guarded by Israeli forces and have been targets of Palestinian militant attacks. After the 2005 pullout, Israel wanted to keep control of Gaza's border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Route, to control traffic and prevent smuggling. However, it was obliged by international pressure to abandon the plan and it handed over responsibility for the border to Egypt. Since Hamas took over the strip by force in June 2007, Egypt has kept largely its border with Gaza closed. It is opened occasionally for humanitarian reasons and to allow pilgrims to pass through. Tunnels have been built under the border which are used to bring in all kinds of goods, and weapons. Officially goods can enter from Egypt by the Kerem Shalom crossing and from Israel via the Sufa and Karni crossings, both of which are controlled by the Israeli army. These crossings have been closed much of the time since Hamas took over Gaza. The main passenger crossing point into Israel, Erez in the north, has been closed to Palestinians for long periods, preventing labourers from working in Israel, though internationals and emergency medical cases are allowed to cross. In the late 1990s, the Palestinians were allowed to open their own airport in the Gaza Strip, but this has been put out of use by Israeli attacks since the 2000 intifada. Israel agreed in principle to the opening of a seaport for Gaza and to allow bus connections with the West Bank in a US-brokered deal in November 2005. But both moves are yet to be implemented. Gaza is the stronghold of the Palestinian militant organisation Hamas, which won parliamentary elections in January 2006. Hamas effectively governs the territory. Hamas routed the Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip in June 2007 Other groups such as Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committee have a strong presence in the Strip. In June 2007, Fatah was routed in Gaza along with the Fatah affiliated al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. Despite Gaza's isolation, militants have continued to attack Israeli interests from the Strip since the 2005 pull-out. The main vehicle of resistance, as the militants describe it, is the firing of short-range homemade rockets which can reach nearby Israeli population centres, such as Sderot, less than a kilometre from Gaza's north-east corner. Palestinian militant groups have started firing more sophisticated rockets, some reaching 40km (25 miles) in to Israel. These have caused a handful of deaths, injuries and severe disruption for Israelis living within range. Israeli shelling and missile attacks, meanwhile, which Israel says are meant to stop the rocket fire, have killed large numbers of Gazans, including many civilians.        "
194,"Despite getting more votes than in his 1945 landslide victory, Prime Minister Clement Attlee now had a Commons majority of just five seats.  Five years of post-war austerity had dented Labour's appeal to the middle class as Conservative fortunes revived.  Although both the major parties were able to take heart from the results, 1950 was an unmitigated disaster for the Liberals.  They took just nine seats and suffered a massive financial blow as over 300 of their candidates lost their deposits.  Both Labour and the Tories entered the election campaign in good heart and public interest was high.  During the previous five years the government had not lost a single by-election and although the Tories spurned the radical step of changing their name after the humiliation of 1945, they had thoroughly revamped their polices and their grassroots organisation.  Dual votes for owners of business were scrapped as were the separate seats representing the older universities - benefiting Labour.  On the plus side for the Conservatives, the boundary commission had attempted to reduce the electoral representation of some urban seats now no longer heavily populated.  The introduction of postal votes proved another great plus for the party.  Despite the occasional harsh outburst during the 1945-1950 parliament from Labour cabinet members such as Nye Bevan that the Tories were ""lower than vermin"", the election campaign saw something of a change of temper and did not turn into a bitter slanging match.  Indeed Churchill called it a ""demure"" campaign. And when his party made its peace and accepted Labour's introduction of the health service and a mixed economy, the battle lines were drawn firmly, if narrowly, around the issue of further nationalisation.  The Cold War forced its way into the campaign briefly when Churchill called for a high level summit with Russia.  But despite his intervention Labour looked the likeliest victor.  This was the second consecutive election contest between Attlee and Churchill, so the voters knew the goods on offer very well by now.  Attlee was a respected if not inspirational figure while Churchill remained personally popular. But some eyebrows were raised - not least by some of Churchill's ambitious younger colleagues - at the idea of a man approaching his eighties being returned to Downing Street.  For Labour, Ernest Bevin commanded respect as foreign secretary while Nye Bevan at health did much to inspire working-class commitment to the party when he introduced the National Health Service in 1948.  For the Conservatives, Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden waited in the wings as Churchill's heir apparent.  And R A Butler and Lord Woolton had worked behind the scenes since the Tories' 1945 drubbing by Labour to modernise and reform the party's organisation, as well as renew its pitch to voters. It proved time well spent.  With nationalisation the key issue, voters divided on class lines much more clearly than in 1945. Taking a view from the side of the campaign, the Liberals said the election was a ""class struggle"".  In Labour's manifesto - Let Us Win Through Together - Attlee promised to nationalise steel, cement and sugar despite the poor state of the economy and the poor returns from the nationalisations already carried out.  Sterling had been devalued in the previous year, highlighting the country's fragile state, while many key Labour figures were against taking their case to the public in the first winter election for decades.  But the party stuck to its task, making the case for taking cement and sugar into the public fold, saying they were private monopolies. Sugar company Tate & Lyle launched a fierce fight-back - with cartoon character Mr Cube taking on the government from the cover of sugar packets across the nation.  Setting out their stall in their manifesto, This is the Road, the Conservatives entered into a consensus with Labour over health and welfare. But they were staunch in their opposition to further nationalisation."
195,"Child benefit is to be axed for higher-rate taxpayers, the chancellor has announced. Why did this payment go to rich and poor alike in the first place?  Announcing that child benefit will be axed for higher-rate taxpayers from 2013, Chancellor George Osborne said it was ""very hard to justify taxing people on much lower incomes in order to pay the child benefit to some of the better-off in our society"".  It is a powerful argument in an era when rich and poor alike are braced for painful spending cuts. But when the British welfare state was established in the aftermath of World War II, the principle of making it accessible to all was regarded as crucial.  According to Professor Stein Ringen of the University of Oxford, post-war policymakers were scarred by the indignities of the means test during the 1930s depression and believed making services and payments available to all would reinforce support for the system among rich and poor alike.  ""The advantage of universal benefits is their simplicity - means testing was regarded as very complicated and inefficient,"" he adds.  ""With universal benefits, you can be sure that those who need them most will get them.""  The civil servant William Beveridge's 1942 blueprint for the welfare state envisaged a ""cradle to the grave"" system of shared citizenship.  On the basis of these principles, Clement Attlee's Labour government introduced the family allowance in 1946, paid to households for all but their first child.  This were superseded in 1975 by child benefit, which was set at a higher level than the family allowance, included all children and was paid directly to mothers and to lone fathers.  Pat Thane, professor of contemporary British history at the University of London's Institute of Historical Research, argues that the 1970s reforms reflected changes in assumptions about the status of women.  She says child benefit also replaced tax allowances, introduced in 1911, which ""were granted to all income-tax payers in respect of each child"". These ""benefited mainly the better-off and mainly men"".  ""Women had campaigned to have them paid to women and not to men through the pay packet or the tax system because they didn't trust all men to hand the money to their families."" she adds.  Over time, however, the assumptions which underpinned the policy were eroded, according to Bernard Harris, professor of the history of social policy at the University of Southampton.  In the immediate post-war era, he says, Labour politicians tended to favour universality, while the Conservatives leaned towards targeting.  He traces the move away from universalism to the Labour Party's abandonment during the 1990s of high rates of taxation for those on the highest incomes.  ""Because they accepted that, the flipside was that you targeted benefits away from high earners,"" he says - hence Child Tax credits, introduced in 2003 to address need within the tax system, rather than straightforward handouts.  ""Because this thinking hit the better-off, the parties' positions switched - so you had a situation where the Conservatives were calling for the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings and Gordon Brown was resisting it.""  As such, Mr Osborne will be aware that - even if ending universal child benefits hurts many of his own party's supporters - the trend towards his move has been evident on both sides of the political aisle."
196,"China is on course to overtake the US in scientific output possibly as soon as 2013 - far earlier than expected.  That is the conclusion of a major new study by the Royal Society, the UK's national science academy.  The country that invented the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing is set for a globally important comeback.  An analysis of published research - one of the key measures of scientific effort - reveals an ""especially striking"" rise by Chinese science.  The study, Knowledge, Networks and Nations, charts the challenge to the traditional dominance of the United States, Europe and Japan.  The figures are based on the papers published in recognised international journals listed by the Scopus service of the publishers Elsevier.  In 1996, the first year of the analysis, the US published 292,513 papers - more than 10 times China's 25,474.  By 2008, the US total had increased very slightly to 316,317 while China's had surged more than seven-fold to 184,080.  Previous estimates for the rate of expansion of Chinese science had suggested that China might overtake the US sometime after 2020.  But this study shows that China, after displacing the UK as the world's second leading producer of research, could go on to overtake America in as little as two years' time.  ""Projections vary, but a simple linear interpretation of Elsevier's publishing data suggests that this could take place as early as 2013,"" it says.  Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, chair of the report, said he was ""not surprised"" by this increase because of China's massive boost to investment in R&D.  Chinese spending has grown by 20% per year since 1999, now reaching over $100bn, and as many as 1.5 million science and engineering students graduated from Chinese universities in 2006.  ""I think this is positive, of great benefit, though some might see it as a threat and it does serve as a wake-up call for us not to become complacent.""  The report stresses that American research output will not decline in absolute terms and raises the possibility of countries like Japan and France rising to meet the Chinese challenge.  ""But the potential for China to match American output in terms of sheer numbers in the near to medium term is clear.""  The authors describe ""dramatic"" changes in the global scientific landscape and warn that this has implications for a nation's competitiveness.  According to the report, ""The scientific league tables are not just about prestige - they are a barometer of a country's ability to compete on the world stage"".  Along with the growth of the Chinese economy, this is yet another indicator of China's extraordinarily rapid rise as a global force.  However the report points out that a growing volume of research publications does not necessarily mean in increase in quality.  One key indicator of the value of any research is the number of times it is quoted by other scientists in their work.  Although China has risen in the ""citation"" rankings, its performance on this measure lags behind its investment and publication rate.  ""It will take some time for the absolute output of emerging nations to challenge the rate at which this research is referenced by the international scientific community.""  The UK's scientific papers are still the second most-cited in the world, after the US.  Dr Cong Cao, associate professor at Nottingham University's School of Contemporary Chinese Studies, agrees with the assessment that the quantity of China's science is yet not matched by its quality.  A sociologist originally from Shanghai, Dr Cao told the BBC: ""There are many millions of graduates but they are mandated to publish so the numbers are high.  ""It will take many years for some of the research to catch up to Western standards.""  As to China's motivation, Dr Cao believes that there is a determination not to be dependent on foreign know-how - and to reclaim the country's historic role as a global leader in technology."
197,"There is another British man hoping to derail Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open this week before Andy Murray gets the chance.  When Djokovic takes on Gilles Muller on Monday, the world number one will have Boris Becker in his box and the Luxembourg number one will have Jamie Delgado.  It might sound like a mismatch, but 31-year-old Muller's presence in the fourth round highlights Delgado's considerable impact in his first year of coaching.  ""It's awesome to play against the best player in the world in a night match at a Grand Slam,"" Delgado told BBC Sport.  ""That's what Gilles has worked so hard for. Twelve months ago he started off at the lower tournaments and had to go to some places he didn't want to go to, so to get to this sort of stage is amazing.  ""But we're also looking for him to go out there and play his game and push Djokovic, and if he plays well maybe even beat him.""  Delgado, a former British Davis Cup player and world number 121, saw his role evolve over the last year from Muller's doubles partner to coach.  ""I wanted to help him get to his career ranking, to do something he hadn't achieved before, and he matched his best of 42 last week,"" said Delgado.  ""After the matches he's won here, he'll go up, and that was a goal for us.""  Muller was languishing around the mid-300s in the rankings last January after missing the previous six months with an elbow injury, and the route back to the top was arduous.  He took in Germany, France, Kazakhstan, Mexico, China, Taiwan and South Korea in the search for ranking points on the second-tier Challenger Tour, before breaking back into the top 100 after coming through qualifying at Wimbledon.  That tournament also saw Delgado set a record for a male player with his 23rd consecutive Wimbledon appearance as he played doubles with Muller, something he does not expect to repeat this year.  ""If someone would give me a spot in the draw, I'd love it,"" said the 37-year-old from Birmingham. ""But I'm not banking on it.""  Delgado has plenty to keep him occupied, having just opened the Living Tennis academy at Bisham Abbey with former British number three Martin Lee, along with media work.  He has a 24-week contract with Muller and designs on pushing well beyond 42 in the world, after the 6ft 4in big-server responded so well to his initial plan.  ""From what I saw last year with him physically, I made it clear that what was going on was not good enough,"" said Delgado.  ""He's now got a physical trainer back in Luxembourg who did a good pre-season with him and has given him a programme that he does on the road, and I manage it.  ""He's bought into it and he's had some good results early in the year, which is great because it confirms to him that it works.""  Even in a tournament of surprises, a victory against Djokovic would top the lot, but Delgado has expectations of his man's first meeting with the world's best.  ""It will be a tough match obviously but Gilles has worked really hard, improved in his professionalism, and tactically he's better,"" said the Briton.  ""It will be interesting if he can play his game. There's no better test of where you're at.""  Just do not expect histrionics when the cameras cut to the player's box on Monday - Delgado plans to take a leaf out of Ivan Lendl's book.  ""Gilles is always looking for eye contact,"" he said.  ""I try and be as relaxed as I can, not too over-excited or with my head in my hands. I try to keep on an even keel, even if inside I'm not feeling that way!  ""I'll be excited, nervous for him and for us, and obviously egging him on and hoping he does himself proud, because he's good enough to give Djokovic trouble.  ""If he were to do that, even if he was to come up short it would help a lot for the rest of the year."""
198,"Linda Adams, from California, escaped by faking an asthma attack as she was marched into the jungle.  Mrs Adams told how around 100 heavily-armed rebels attacked her campsite in Bwindi National Park at 0645 (0345 GMT) on Monday after sweeping down from the surrounding hills.  She said they quickly separated Americans and Britons from the group and released most of the others.  Mrs Adams told the Evening Standard newspaper in London that the rebels had tortured the British.  ""The group holding the British people treated them quite badly,"" she said. ""A British guy was sitting next to me. I could see he had purple toenails from being beaten.""  After seizing their hostages the rebels marched them up a mountain path.  ""I told them I had asthma and they let me go. Did they think I might hinder them climbing? They could have shot me but they didn't shoot me. I didn't have my shoes and they gave me my shoes to walk.''  Mrs Adams, a businesswoman, was shocked when told some of her fellow hostages had been killed.  ""The sound in the valley, the vibration, was quite a shock,"" she said. ""I heard the gunshots and some noises. I got out of my tent and I walked around the corner to the front and I got caught.  ""I saw gentlemen running with guns and four of them came over and grabbed me, all the money that I had, and told me to sit down,"" she said.  ""After a while they brought some of the other captives ... from the other camps, marched them up and asked them what nationality they were. If they were British or American, they were sent to my group.''  The tourists had travelled to the game park in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest to track rare mountain gorillas.  Mrs Adams said her father had warned her not to go on the trip but she ignored him. ""It wasn't going to happen to me,"" she added."
199,"She had performed the unusual feat of winning re-election, despite the mass unemployment her battle against inflation had seen.  But Thatcher took fewer votes than in 1979. Her landslide was caused by the almost equal split in support between Labour and the SDP-Liberal Alliance.  For Labour the 1983 election had been an unmitigated disaster. The only consolation for leader Michael Foot was that Labour had not lost second place to the strong challenge posed by the Alliance.  But although the Alliance could talk up the seven million votes it received it had actually won very few seats - leaving its dream of a breakthrough just that, a dream.  Margaret Thatcher's first administration got off to a fairly shaky start. Her attempt to take the economy by the scruff of the neck and wage a crusade against inflation saw massive unemployment.  If such voter anger was to continue the Conservatives looked like they would be continuing the by now familiar merry go round of Tory governments followed by Labour.  But luckily for the Conservatives Labour had troubles of its own - in spades. The adoption of the principled and high-minded Michael Foot as leader saw the party shift dramatically to the left in opposition.  Leading members of Labour's pro-European wing felt the party no longer had any place for them and in 1981 more than 20 MPs left Labour as Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers set up the Social Democratic Party.  The SDP quickly got into bed with the Liberals, forming the Alliance. The extent to which the new party captured the public imagination was shown when some polls placed them ahead of not just the Tories but Labour as well.  But their support was to wane with the onset of the Falklands War in 1982.  Thatcher's success in re-taking the Falkland Islands after an invasion by Argentina was a very risky venture, but for the loss of 255 servicemen the islands were re-taken.  This bold, decisive move seemed to have been in step with the times, and the Tories now had a grip on power that would remain unshakeable for years.  When the election date was set for 9 June 1983, the pollsters at least were certain that a Thatcher victory was inevitable.  Perhaps a more interesting fight would be the battle between Labour and the Alliance for second place.  Since going down to Thatcher's first election victory in 1979 Labour had changed leaders and marched firmly to the left.  Leading the party into his first and last election battle Michael Foot fought a poor campaign, lacking in organisation as well as the necessary money, not to mention a series of policies that the voters could not support.  The Alliance, although more measured in its pitch to the voters, also suffered from a lack of funds, and Roy Jenkins, its ""prime minister designate"" fared badly in his role as figurehead.  By contrast the Conservatives under Cecil Parkinson ran a highly professional operation.  Money was not a problem, new computer systems were invested in and new techniques such as direct mail were employed to good effect.  And stiff measures were taken against complacent Tory voters when around 1,000 copies of the Labour manifesto were bought and distributed to supporters to help remind them what a Labour government might entail.  The commanding figure of Margaret Thatcher, fresh from victory in the Falklands War, cast a dominant presence over the 1983 election.  The conflict, from April to June 1982, had succeeded in turning Thatcher's strong personality and resolve into a formidable electoral asset for the Tories.  Although in possession of a sharp mind, Labour leader Michael Foot was seen by few as the best possible choice for prime minister in what was presented as an electoral contest between Foot and Thatcher as much as it was between Tory and Labour.  Foot, a former journalist, was the choice of the party's left and his policies drew little support, even from the former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.  His leadership saw the Labour split that lead to the Alliance's birth.  Roy Jenkins, the former Labour chancellor and home secretary, was initially the key figure of their campaign but as he failed to create an impression with the voters his presence was scaled down, and the Alliance's ratings grew in response.  The Conservative manifesto, Forward - the Challenge of Our Times, showed a party hoping to become more radical during a second term.  Reform of the trade unions' political levy was floated, as was a programme of privatisation that was to include British Telecom, British Airways and British Steel.  And the metropolitan councils, all Labour strongholds, as well as the Greater London Council were to be scrapped.  Labour's left wing programme, rambling and radical in equal measure, was referred to by a member of the shadow cabinet as the ""longest suicide note in history"".  It contained pledges towards unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Community as well as the abolition of the House of Lords.  While the Alliance in its offering - Working Together for Britain - promised to reduce unemployment by up to a million.  It also pledged proportional representation and devolution for Scotland and Wales, and called for compulsory balloting before unions could undertake strike action."
200,"Tesco is hoping to set up a 'limited number' of trial convenience stores on Esso's petrol forecourts.  If the joint venture proves a success, Tesco could look to roll out the stores nationwide over the next few years.  Esso already has around 1,000 convenience stores at its petrol stations.  Tesco said: ""We believe that the combination of Tesco expertise in grocery retailing and Esso's expertise in petrol retailing makes this a great deal for customers who will get top quality products at low prices in convenient locations.""  ""When a final decision has been made by the two companies to proceed, further details will be given,"" the company added.  Supermarkets such as Tesco fired the first shot by slashing petrol prices, but Esso fired back with its 1996 ""Price Watch"" campaign, where the group pledged to match the lowest petrol price within the local area of its petrol stations.  The ensuing price war massacred petrol retailers profits, until a truce was finally called.  Now petrol retailers and supermarket chains are vying to team up with each other to improve earnings.  Safeway and BP recently announced their own joint venture, Somerfield has joined forced with Elf, Budgen's with Q8 chain, owned by Kuwait Petroleum and Alldays operates around 150 Total shops.  Esso is part of the US oil giant Exxon and accounts for almost a fifth of the UK petrol retailing market.  The deal will have to be sanctioned by the Office of Fair Trading, which has the task of assessing whether the tie up will create competition concerns.  It is unclear whether Esso will run Tesco's 288 petrol stations."
201,"Tesco is a retail phenomenon. With profits topping £2bn a year, it has nearly a third of the UK's grocery market.  But having crushed its supermarket rivals, the red, white, and blue battalion is not stopping there.  Tesco already sells more chart CDs than Woolworths, more kids' clothes than M&S, and looks set to overtake Dixons as the UK's number one non-food retailer.  Not bad for a business which started as an East End market stall and made its name ""piling them high and selling them cheap"" to a generation of cash-strapped housewives.  In those days Tesco played second fiddle to an altogether classier outfit: Sainsbury's.  ""Tesco would appeal to the sort of Barbara Windsor type of working class woman, whereas Sainsbury's was more Julie Andrews,"" says business biographer Judi Bevan.  So how did this struggling store chain transform itself into a supermarket giant?  Tesco has rewritten the retail bible, with three simple commandments which led it out of the wilderness and to the top.  The first; if you want to be a supermarket superpower, you have to be everywhere.  And that's just what Tesco has set out to do. Tesco has an insatiable appetite for space, and is relentless in its pursuit of the best new sites.  Just ask the residents of Gerrard's Cross, who are watching a 20,000 sq ft Tesco superstore materialising on top of the town's railway.  When it comes to gobbling space, Tesco leaves its rivals standing. In 2002, it stunned experts and the competition by buying T&S, a chain of 850 convenience stores across the country. The deal doubled the group's store count in the UK at a stroke.  ""This was a really smart move by Tesco,"" observes Professor Paul Dobson of Loughborough University business school.  ""The scale of it allowed them to capture quite an increase in market share, and they really caught the rest of the industry out.""  But not everyone was impressed. The residents of Bicester in Oxfordshire had been happy enough with two Tesco stores in their small market town, but after Tesco bought T&S, they found themselves with six.  Local resident Jo Scott now feels trapped in what some are beginning to call Tescotown.  ""I probably do 95% of my shopping at Tesco and that's only because I have no choice... even if I am popping out for a pint of milk or loaf of bread it will be to Tesco,"" she says.  For Tesco the determination to be everywhere has paid off. It now has an empire of nearly 1,800 stores, more than Asda and Sainsbury's put together.  All things to all shoppers  But being everywhere isn't enough. The second commandment in the Tesco bible says; to be a supermarket superpower you have to sell to everyone.  ""They've pulled off a trick that I'm not aware of any other retailer achieving,"" says Citigroup's retail analyst David McCarthy.  ""That is to appeal to all segments of the market.""  And that is because Tesco offers three distinct ranges of own-brand products, from Value to Finest, priced to attract all types of shoppers to its stores.  According to McCarthy, Tesco now has more upmarket customers than M&S and Waitrose put together, but has also hung on to its ""pile it high and sell it cheap"" roots.  ""Whether you're are a prince or a pauper you can go into Tesco and find something you want,"" says writer Judi Bevan.  It's a formula which has helped lure 15 million customers a week to Tesco stores.  But there is one final ingredient in the Tesco recipe for success: to be a supermarket superpower, Thou Shalt Sell Everything.  And Tesco is well on the way to doing that. In its largest stores shoppers can choose from 40,000 product lines - anything from baked beans to bikinis.  ""The non-food business, in the way we define it, is bigger than the food market,"" explains Tesco marketing director Tim Mason.  For Tesco, that immediately doubles its opportunities over and above what it would have were it to stay simply as a food retailer.  Tesco has just announced plans to open its first non-food-only store, to be named Tesco Homeplus.  It's a move which could spell bad news for some of the UK's best known High Street names, already reeling from the Tesco challenge.  ""Specialist retailers like Dixons and Boots: these retailers are going to have a tough time as Tesco gathers momentum,"" predicts Bill Grimsey, former CEO of The Big Food Group, which runs Iceland stores.  ""And the net result of this will be that some of these specialist stores will find it hard eventually to compete.""  Mr Grimsey believes the competition authorities have failed in their duty to the public by allowing Tesco to become so big.  And he is fearful for the future. ""The consumer will be left with a choice of Tesco, Tesco or Tesco,"" he warns, ""and I don't think that's in the best interests of UK plc.""  But despite these concerns the Tesco juggernaut rumbles on, and the list of areas ripe for the Tesco treatment is growing all the time. Last month it announced plans to launch into estate agency.  So what's next for the supermarket superpower?  ""If anyone wants to get married in their local Tesco store,"" says marketing director Tim Mason, ""we'd be all too happy to let them do it.""  The Money Programme is transmitted on BBC2 on Friday 3 June at 1900GMT."
202,"Tesco has sold its garden centre chain Dobbies for £217m as the retailer continues with its strategy of focusing on its supermarket business.  Dobbies has been sold to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital.  The sale comes a week after Tesco announced the sale of UK restaurant chain Giraffe and its Turkish business.  Tesco bought Dobbies in 2007 for £150m and it is now the UK's second largest gardening retailer.  Dobbies - which has its headquarters in Lasswade, near Edinburgh - operates 35 garden centres in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.  Tesco said that the business contributed £17m to its annual profits last year.  Tesco has embarked on an asset sale programme in recent months, disposing of what it considers to be non-core parts of its business.  In addition to the recent sale of the Giraffe chain and Kipa, Tesco sold its South Korean business, Homeplus, last September for £4.2bn.  The sales are part of attempts by Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis to revive the retail giant's fortunes.  Announcing the sale of the garden centre business, Mr Lewis said: ""Through their hard work and dedication to customer service Dobbies colleagues have built a great business and I would like to thank them for everything they have done.  ""It was a difficult decision to sell the business but we believe this agreement will give Dobbies a bright future while allowing our UK retail business to focus on its core strengths."""
203,"Tesco has suspended four executives, including its UK managing director, after the supermarket overstated its half-year profit guidance by £250m.  That would be almost a quarter of its expected profit for the period.  It has launched an investigation headed by Deloitte, and says it is now working to establish the impact of the issue on its full-year results.  ""Disappointment would be an understatement,"" said Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis.  Mr Lewis, who only took the helm on 1 September, said it was ""a serious issue"", but insisted ""it doesn't take away from what I'm able to build at Tesco"".  The news prompted a plunge in Tesco's share price, which closed 11.6% lower at 203p.  As a result almost £2.2bn was wiped from Tesco's value on the stock market.  Mr Lewis said ""a number of people"" had been suspended from duty ""to facilitate the fullest and deepest investigation possible"", but said this was not ""disciplinary or an admission of guilt"".  UK managing director Chris Bush is one of those suspended, according to Radio 5 Live presenter Adam Parsons.  Mr Lewis said Robin Terrell, Tesco's multi-channel director, would be ""stepping in and running and leading the UK leadership team"", but he refused to confirm that Mr Bush had been suspended.  Tesco is also believed to have suspended its UK finance director Carl Rogberg, its food commercial director John Scouler and the head of food sourcing Matt Simister.  Mr Lewis said the issue was ""something completely out of the ordinary"" and his priority was to carry out ""a full and frank investigation"".  ""We will take decisive action as the results of the investigation become clear,"" he added.  Tesco also confirmed that there had been no chief financial officer (CFO) at the group since its current CFO Laurie McIlwee left just over a week ago, following his resignation in April.  Marks and Spencer's CFO, Alan Stewart, was announced as Mr McIlwee's replacement in July, but is not due to join Tesco until December.  Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent rebuffed criticism that he should have discovered the issue sooner.  ""Things are always unnoticed until they have been noticed."" he said. ""The shareholders will have to decide for themselves whether I'm part of the solution or part of the problem.""  Breaking accounting rules to exaggerate profits is a cardinal sin as far as investors are concerned and Tesco has been punished severely with shares falling more than 10% at one stage today.  The scale of the discrepancies which happened in its core UK food retail business poses serious questions on how this important UK company has been run.  In effect this FTSE 100 company has been operating without a CFO - their replacement for Laurie McIlwee is not due to start for several weeks.  Questions must also be asked of the former boss Philip Clarke, the entire board of directors and the company's auditors.  Taken in isolation this incident would be serious, but added to falling sales, profit warnings and a share price at 10-year lows, it suggests this once formidable retailer is in a state of disarray.  The new boss, Dave Lewis, will hope the investigation he has launched will help put this latest disaster behind him as he tries to rebuild the relationship with customers and investors.  On 29 August, Tesco had said it expected its trading profit for the six months to 23 August to be about £1.1bn, lower than management had expected.  In its latest statement, Tesco said the profits overstatement was ""principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs"".  It also said some of the error - which referred to its expected profits for the six months to 23 August - was due to the timing of the accounting of payments between suppliers and Tesco.  Mr Lewis said this meant ""an element of"" expected revenue from its suppliers had been ""reported in the wrong time period"".  ""It's about revenue received versus when the activity took place,"" he added.  Tesco said ""an informed employee"" had alerted the board to the issue on Friday, and added it had already informed the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.  As a result of the problem, Tesco has pushed back the release of its interim results to 23 October, from 1 October.  Deloitte will carry out its investigation with Freshfields, the group's external legal advisers.  Tesco's usual auditors are PWC. The accountancy firm declined to comment.  Shares in Tesco reached an 11-year low in August after the firm cut its full-year profit forecast to £2.4bn from £2.8bn.  The supermarket group has been battling falling sales and a decline in its market share as discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl have gained in popularity.  Previous chief executive Philip Clarke stood down in July after his attempts to revive Tesco's fortunes through a £1bn turnaround plan failed.  Cantor Fitzgerald said it had already warned last November that it believed Tesco was ""demanding/taking money from suppliers trading accounts"".  ""We believed Tesco had been overstating its UK commercial gross profit by £200m+ per annum, via deducting monies from suppliers' trading accounts or extending payment dates without notice,"" it added.  Professor Ajay Bhalla of Cass Business School said ""things could not be worse for Tesco's management and shareholders"".  ""The incoming CEO - Mr. Lewis has a momentous task in hand. Re-building the internal culture and market reputation will be his number one priority,"" he said.  And Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said he was ""flabbergasted"" by Tesco's announcement.  ""Such an announcement is not the stuff of a well operated FTSE-100 organisation. This development may raise, indeed must raise, much more fundamental questions over the chairman's (Richard Broadbent) position and the nature, composition and extent of the board."""
204,"Tesco occupies a unique place in British retail, visited by millions but controversial to many. It all started with a barrow selling fish paste.  There's a famous stat - that at its peak one pound in every seven spent in the UK went into a Tesco till.*  It's the UK's biggest retailer by sales and also the nation's biggest private employer, with more than 330,000 staff working in 3,146 stores. Pre-tax profits are in the billions and its achievements and failures make national, often international, news.  It's the world's third largest supermarket group, with stores in 12 countries. More than 27 million people outside the UK have a Tesco Clubcard.  It's part of the fabric of daily life. Nearly everyone has an opinion on it, often vehement.  It all started in 1919 with Jack Cohen. The 21-year-old left the Royal Flying Corps at the end of World War I and used his demob money to buy surplus food from the Army and sell it from a barrow in Hackney. His first stock was fish paste and golden syrup.  By 1924 he had started selling his first own-brand product, tea. Looking for a name he took the first three letters of his supplier, TE Stockwell, and combined them with the first two letters of his own. Tesco was born and the first shop was opened in 1929 in north London.  Cohen believed in the business model ""stack 'em high, sell 'em low"". It earned him the nickname ""slasher Jack"".  ""Cohen built his business when there was still a lot of austerity around,"" says Phil Lyon, a retail historian at Queen Margaret University Edinburgh. ""To drive business development of that kind at that time was quite remarkable. He totally understood what worked for the mass market.""  In the recession at the start of the 1990s Tesco quickly realised shoppers wanted their money to go further.  The company launched its Value range in 1993. It went on to become the second biggest grocery brand in the UK at its peak and the brand alone generated an estimated annual turnover of more than £1bn. By 1996 Tesco's sales in the UK had jumped ahead of Sainsbury's.  The size of the company's orders allowed them to negotiate bargains with even the biggest manufacturers.  ""The sheer size of all the main supermarkets gave them immense power,"" says David Gray, analyst at Planet Retail. ""Tesco was very aggressive, getting the best deals.""  As this power grew the relationship between all the big supermarkets and their suppliers came under scrutiny. In 2000 the Competition Commission carried out a major inquiry into the issue which lead to the creation of a Code of Practice. It's an issue that rumbles on, with dairy farmers protesting last year about the low price some supermarkets pay for milk.  Tesco says it negotiates the best prices on behalf of customers but that it is also fair and that suppliers stay with the company. It says it pays one of the highest prices for milk out of all the main supermarkets.  But what really took Tesco to the top was watching customer behaviour. It was the first British supermarket to do so and it was a game-changing move.  The introduction of the Tesco Clubcard is the single most significant factor in the success of the company, says Sir Terry Leahy, the supermarket's chief executive from 1997 to 2011.  ""I knew the whole industry's structure would never be the same again,"" he says.  The idea of a loyalty scheme was not new. The savvy Cohen had been an early adopter of Green Shield Stamps in 1963 and successfully exploited the incentive scheme to his advantage. But the Clubcard was a loyalty scheme for the age of computerised research.  Tesco collected raw data on what people were buying and turned it into profitable information. It was also able to offer personalised discounts and rewards. Rolled out nationally in 1995, the card was an instant success. One year later Tesco became the UK's top supermarket.  The scheme fundamentally changed the way all supermarkets did business and typifies Tesco's success, say business analysts.  ""It became such a success story because it was aggressive at adapting to consumer trends, diversifying and innovating,"" says Gray. ""It took a hell of a lot of risks in the 1990s but they paid off.""  And diversify it did. Tesco is now a bank, it offers insurance, credit cards and loans. You can buy a flat-screen TV, a mobile phone and clothes alongside bread, milk and butter. It runs education programmes for staff and keep fit classes.  Even its critics have some grudging regard for the company.  ""You have to respect the clinical efficiency with which Tesco carried out its business plan,"" says Andrew Simms, author of Tescopoly: How One Shop Came Out on Top and Why It Matters. ""With the Clubcard it totally understood information is power.""  Tesco went on to cement its dominance by expanding massively - the source of much of the controversy. Again it had its roots in Cohen's ideas. He always believed in owning the shops he did business from. Between 1955 and 1960 alone he bought more than 500 new shops.  But it was during the recession of the 1990s that it really grew. Big sites were acquired for a new generation of out-of-town superstores. Again it spotted the market before its competitors. The same happened when it headed back into towns and cities and started opening smaller convenience stores - the Tesco Metro - in 1994.  Its property portfolio was huge and included land it didn't develop. Critics noted that if Tesco owned it no other supermarket could build on it, leaving them struggling.  ""They didn't catch up then and they haven't caught up to this day,"" says Lord MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco from 1985 to 1997.  But while the new developments were initially seen as progress, they came to divide opinion. Supermarkets as a whole have been criticised for creating ""clone towns"". National organisations like the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) have expressed concern about the impact their ""aggressive expansion"" has had on small businesses.  In 2006 the Office of Fair Trading referred the market to the Competition Commission for a second time. It concluded that in many respects UK grocery retailers were ""delivering a good deal for consumers"" but action was ""needed to improve competition in local markets"".  ""All supermarkets came under fire, it was a problem for the whole industry,"" says Gray. ""As they got bigger and more powerful they were always more likely to come under attack.""  Because of its huge expansion Tesco has often been singled out for more vehement criticism. The National Consumer Council has called it the Marmite of British business, appearing both among the most trusted and the most distrusted companies in consumer surveys.  ""It's because of its sheer size and clout,"" says Simms. ""It's incredibly hard for smaller operators to compete against.""  Wrangles over planning permission for developments often find Tesco in the news.  Smaller disputes are pitched as David and Goliath battles. Just last week campaigners in Sherborne, Dorset, claimed victory when the supermarket decided not to open a store in the town.  ""Joy for Sherborne as people power beats off plans for Tesco superstore"" was the headline in the Times. ""Brilliant news for the people of Sherborne and their fantastic town. They've beaten Tesco!"" tweeted retail expert Mary Portas.  But Tesco said planning issues and not protest influenced the decision.  In 2011 a raid on a squat occupied by opponents of a newly opened Tesco store in Bristol left eight police officers and several protesters injured. It resulted in rioting during which the shop was attacked.  On the flip side there is a group campaigning for new Tesco stores. Earlier this year in Felixstowe people staged a rally with placards that read: ""Yes to Tesco"". They said they didn't want to lose the chance of the supermarket opening a superstore in the area as it would give local people ""real choice"".  But despite its dominance, times have got tougher for Tesco. This year its profits fell for the first time in 20 years. It was said to have taken its ""eye off the ball"" in the lucrative UK market and focused on foreign markets too much.  What does it mean for the company? Based on history, the chain will probably adapt and change, say business analysts.  Maybe it should ask itself what Jack Cohen would do.  * Tesco doesn't use this figure as the ratio varies from year to year. For 2013, based on ONS retail sales figures and Tesco UK sales of £43.6bn it is more like one in eight.

208,"A United Nations report accuses Eritrea of planning a car bomb attack at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.  The UN Monitoring Group report on Somalia and Eritrea says the aim was to disrupt the summit in Addis Ababa last January.  Ethiopia accused its neighbour of training rebels to carry out bombings on targets in the city, including an international hotel.  Eritrea has repeatedly denied any involvement in such a plot.  ""We say this is totally a fabrication and the report is absurd. We have never been involved in any acts of terrorism,"" said the Eritrean ambassador to the UN, Araya Desta, in a radio interview with the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.  The report states that Asmara's spies are active in Uganda, South Sudan, Kenya and Somalia, posing a threat to regional peace and security.  The UN interprets the plot as representing a shift in tactics by the Eritrean intelligence services.  ""Whereas Eritrean support to foreign armed opposition groups has in the past been limited to conventional military operations, the plot to disrupt the African Union summit in Addis Ababa in January 2011, which envisaged mass casualty attacks against civilian targets and the strategic use of explosives to create a climate of fear, represents a qualitative shift in Eritrean tactics,"" said the report.  It outlines the details of the plan: to attack the AU headquarters with a car bomb as African leaders took breaks, to blow up Africa's largest market to ""kill many people"", and attack the area between the prime minister's office and the Sheraton Hotel, where most heads of state stay during AU summits."
209,"The fire took hold at Burlington Gardens in Piccadilly - one of London's most prestigious shopping areas - creating huge amounts of smoke.  The RA said the building, formerly the Museum of Mankind, is currently empty and describes it as a ""separate site"". The main building was evacuated.  Sixty firefighters tackled the fire before it was brought under control.  Eye-witness Rachael White, 29, described seeing grey smoke billowing from the building behind the arts academy and a strong smell of burning in the air.  Another witness, Shannon Gordon, told BBC London: ""All of a sudden I looked up and there were more flames... then the big bang was when the roof collapsed.""  The building which caught fire, 6 Burlington Gardens, was adjacent to but separate from the main RA building - which was evacuated and closed for the day.  It is hoped it will re-open on Wednesday. Several roads in the area are likely to remain shut on Tuesday evening.  The Saatchi gallery has been preparing a major exhibition on American art in the Burlington Gardens building and has said it may have to postpone the opening, which was due for 6 October.  MaryAnne Stevens, RA acting secretary, said: ""The carefully coordinated emergency procedures of the Royal Academy, and the effective management of the incident by the fire and police services, appear to have limited the damage to one gallery and the roof.""  She thanked the emergency services and said the main site would be open on Tuesday.  A fire brigade spokesman said there was significant damage to the roof of the building - it is not known what caused the fire, on the west corner of the roof."
210,"Radiation from Japan's quake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant has reached harmful levels, the government says.  The warning comes after the plant was rocked by a third blast, which appears to have damaged one of the reactors' containment systems for the first time.  If it is breached, there are fears of more serious radioactive leaks.  Officials have extended the danger zone, warning residents within 30km (18 miles) to evacuate or stay indoors.  It appears that for the first time, the containment system around one of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors has been breached. Officials have referred to a possible crack in the suppression chamber of reactor 2 - a large doughnut-shaped structure below the reactor housing. That would allow steam, containing radioactive substances, to escape continuously. This is the most likely source of the high radioactivity readings seen near the site. Another possible source is the fire in reactor 4 building - believed to have started when a pool storing old fuel rods dried up. The readings at the site rose beyond safe limits - 400 millisieverts per hour (mSv/hr), when the average person's exposure is 3mSv in a year. A key question is whether this is just a transient spike, which might be expected if number 2 is the source, or whether the high levels are sustained. In the meantime, the key task for workers at the plant remains to get enough water into the reactors - and, now, into the spent fuel pools - with the poor resources at their disposal.  The government later said that radiation levels at the plant's main gate had fallen sharply.  The crisis has been prompted by last Friday's 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan.  On Tuesday morning, reactor 2 became the third to explode in four days at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.  A fire also briefly broke out at reactor 4, and is believed to have caused radioactive leaks.  Reactor 4 had been shut down before the quake for maintenance, but its spent nuclear fuel rods are still stored on the site.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said they were closely watching the remaining two reactors at the plant, 5 and 6, as they had begun overheating slightly.  He said cooling seawater was being pumped into reactors 1 and 3 - which were returning to normal - and into reactor 2, which remained unstable.  There was a hydrogen blast in reactor 3 on Monday, following another in reactor 1 on Saturday.  Radiation levels in the Japanese capital - 250km (155 miles) away - were reported to be higher than normal, but officials said there were no health dangers.  Tokyo residents have been stocking up on supplies, with some stores selling out of items such as food, water, face masks and candles.  Housewife Mariko Kawase, 34, told AFP news agency: ""I am shopping now because we may not be able to go out due to the radiation.""  Radiation levels in Chiba prefecture, next to Tokyo, were 10 times above normal levels, Kyodo News reports.  In a televised address, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said: ""There is still a very high risk of more radiation coming out.""  He said that 140,000 people living within between 20km (12 mile) and 30km of the plant were at risk and should not leave their homes.  Some 70,000 residents within 20km have already been evacuated, and the premier urged anyone left in that exclusion zone to leave.  ""Now we are talking about levels that can impact human health,"" said the chief cabinet secretary.  He told residents: ""Please do not go outside. Please stay indoors. Please close windows and make your homes airtight.  ""Don't turn on ventilators. Please hang your laundry indoors.""  The government also announced a 30-km no-fly zone above the plant to prevent planes spreading the radiation further afield.  After Tuesday's blast, radiation dosages of up to 400 millisieverts per hour were recorded at the site.  A single dose of 1,000 millisieverts causes temporary radiation sickness such as nausea and vomiting.  Rolling blackouts would affect five million households on Tuesday, said Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), which runs the 40-year-old plant.  Japan's nuclear safety agency said earlier it suspected the latest blast may have damaged reactor 2's suppression chamber.  The BBC's Chris Hogg in Tokyo says that would make it a more serious incident than the previous explosions, which were thought just to have damaged the buildings housing the reactors.  The latest official death toll from the quake and tsunami stands at about 2,400 - but some estimates suggest at least 10,000 may have been killed.  Thousands are still unaccounted for - including hundreds of tourists - while many remote towns and villages have not been reached.  More than 500,000 people have been made homeless.  The government has deployed 100,000 troops to lead the aid effort.  The UK Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn against all non-essential travel to Tokyo and north-eastern Japan. British nationals and friends and relatives of those in Japan can contact the Foreign Office on +44(0) 20 7008 0000."

Anita Sidoris, whose brother died in the crash, said: ""I'm so grateful to the community for inviting us here.  ""It means such a lot to the family. We lost our only brother and (the plaque) is just a very fine thing.""  The plaque was paid for by the Willenhall Wood Residents' Association.

212,"The final passengers have flown into Coventry Airport as an airline ended its operations there.  Thomsonfly's last scheduled service arrived in the city from Malaga in Spain on Sunday afternoon.  The airline said the increased focus on charter holiday flights, rather than on scheduled ones such as those operating from Coventry, had led to the decision.  Coventry Airport has pledged to continue a legal battle to build a new passenger terminal at the airport.  It announced it would appeal against a High Court judgement which ruled against the scheme in October.  Thomsonfly which ran the only passenger service at the airport, began operations there in March 2004.  The airport has said that it regretted but understood the airline's decision.  Executive chairman Brian Cox said ""the length of time and inordinate cost involved in seeking improved terminal facilities"" had not helped the situation.  However, Roger Fawcett, vice chairman of Baginton Parish Council, welcomed the end of the passenger flights and said the aeroplanes' noise had disturbed villagers.  The airport's business aviation and cargo operations will continue."
213,"Legislation that affects just England should normally need backing by a majority of MPs who represent English constituencies, a report says.  The McKay Commission said such a principle should be enshrined in a resolution of the House of Commons.  The commission was launched last year to consider whether Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish MPs should be denied a vote on English-only matters.  The government said it would give the report ""serious consideration"".  But the English Democrats, who campaign for a separate parliament for England, called the proposals a ""fudge"" which failed to address ""the real issue"" of creating equal democratic rights across the UK.  There has been controversy over the so-called West Lothian Question - the ability of Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish MPs to vote on England-only matters - for several decades, but this intensified after devolution.  In 2004, support from Scottish and Welsh MPs allowed the government to push through the introduction of university top-up fees in England.  The commission concluded that the current situation was ""unsustainable"" and changes were needed.  It proposed the principle that Commons decisions with a ""separate and distinct effect"" for England should ""normally be taken only with the consent of a majority of MPs sitting for constituencies in England"".  The same would apply for decisions that affected only England and Wales.  The report said the principle should be enshrined in a resolution of the House, and suggested a range of procedural changes to entrench the approach.  Specific parliamentary time could be allocated to debating plans for England, and MPs would be given an opportunity to vote on motions endorsing or rejecting them.  Committees for scrutinising bills could also be weighted to represent the party balance in England, the report suggested.  However, the commission dismissed as ""flawed and impractical"" a more drastic suggestion, which would require England-only legislation to get a majority of English MPs, as well as an overall majority.  Instead of such a ""double lock"", the commission floated the idea of a ""double count"", where the proportion of English MPs supporting a Bill would be published alongside the overall result.  ""If a government was seen to have failed to attract the support of a majority of MPs from England [or England and Wales] for business affecting those interests, it would be likely to sustain severe political damage,"" it says.  Commission chairman Sir William McKay said Westminster law-making had inevitably come to focus on England, or England and Wales.  ""But the processes for making law at Westminster have not significantly changed,"" he said.  ""Surveys have shown that people in England are unhappy about the existing arrangements and support change.  ""There is a feeling that England is at a disadvantage, and that it's not right that MPs representing the devolved nations should be able to vote on matters affecting England.  ""The status quo clearly cannot be sustained.""  A Cabinet Office spokesman said the government was ""very grateful to Sir William McKay and his colleagues for their work"".  ""This is a very important issue, which is why the government asked this expert commission to look into it.  ""We will give the report very serious consideration before we respond substantively,"" he said.  English Democrats chairman Robin Tilbrook said: ""The commission was set up to come up with a fudge and that is what it has done. It fails to address the real issue.  ""The issue isn't how the House of Commons works. It is that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own parliaments and governments and England does not. We need a democratic government and parliament for England."""
214,"The UK government has announced it has set up a commission to look into the so-called West Lothian question.  There has been a long-running debate about whether Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh MPs should be allowed to vote on legislation that affects only England.  English MPs are not able to vote on many matters which are now devolved to other UK parliaments.  An attempt to solve the problem was part of the coalition agreement, but it has taken the UK government more than a year to announce details of the promised commission into what is a long-running political sore.  A Written Ministerial Statement (WMS) was made in the Commons regarding the matter.  The statement said: ""The government is clear that the commission's primary task should be to examine how this house, and parliament as a whole, can deal most effectively with business that affects England wholly or primarily, when at the same time similar matters in some or all of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are lawfully and democratically the responsibility of the separate parliament or assemblies.""  It also said that;  The question was first posed when the Labour government tried unsuccessfully to introduce devolution in Scotland in the 1970s.  Labour MP Tam Dalyell, whose constituency at the time was West Lothian, wondered how long English MPs would tolerate members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important effect on English politics while they themselves had no say in the matters outside England.  Since the devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, and to the Northern Irish and Welsh assemblies, the West Lothian question has frequently returned to the fore.  The Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government's outline of the broad remit of the commission on the issue coincides with a private member's bill which is due to pass its final Commons hurdle this week.  Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said in March that a commission examining whether MPs should be stopped from having a say on issues which do not affect their constituents would be appointed later this year.  Ministers would prefer Conservative backbencher Harriett Baldwin's Legislation (Territorial Extent) Bill 2010-11 to be withdrawn and the commission left to do its work.  Ms Baldwin said of her bill: ""This simple piece of legislation will clarify the impact of every bill passing through parliament and it is a small step on the way towards solving the so-called West Lothian Question.  ""I am a passionate unionist but I feel this is an issue that needs resolving before the next election.  ""We can't have a situation where a future government relies on a majority of Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish votes to change controversial legislation like tuition fees for England.  ""Although the Coalition Agreement calls for the establishment of the West Lothian commission, it has taken my bill to get movement on this.""  If successful, her bill would require all bills put before the Westminster parliament to contain a clear statement of how they affect each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - including knock-on financial implications.  She hoped that this would allow it to become accepted practice that Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs would not vote on England-only bills.  Labour's Shadow Lord Chancellor, Sadiq Khan, said it was important that the commission focussed on the best interests ""of our nation's constitution"".  He added: ""The government's changes to the constitution have to date been characterised by narrow, selfish, partisan interests about the survival of the coalition.  ""Therefore, I hope that on this issue the government will seek to work with all the major parties on the membership and the terms of reference for the commission."""
215,"A judge in Chile has ordered an investigation into the death, in 1973, of the Nobel prize-winning poet, Pablo Neruda, following allegations he may have been poisoned.  Neruda - a Communist and a friend of President Salvador Allende - died in the immediate aftermath of the military coup that brought General Augusto Pinochet to power.  The poet's family has always maintained that he died in a Santiago clinic of advanced prostate cancer, aged 69.  The foundation that guards his legacy has said in a statement there is ""no proof whatsoever that suggests Pablo Neruda died of causes other than cancer"".  But, pressed by Chile's Communist Party, a judge has now ordered a murder investigation.  This follows allegations from his former driver, Manuel Araya Osorio, that agents injected Neruda with poison at the clinic on the orders of General Pinochet, twelve days after the coup.  Neruda had severely criticised the military for what he saw as a betrayal of his country.  His death is not the only one from that turbulent time to be re-examined recently.  The remains of President Allende were exhumed last month on the orders of the same judge, in an effort to clarify whether he committed suicide - as is widely believed - or was killed by soldiers who stormed the presidential palace during the coup."
216,"Seven Manchester United footballers are among 21 dead after an air crash in Munich.  The British European Airways (BEA) plane caught fire shortly after take off this afternoon with 38 passengers and six crew on board.  The footballing world is reeling from the loss of some of its most talented young players - known as the Busby Babes.  Their average age was 24 and they included Roger Byrne - the captain - Mark Jones, Eddie Colman, Tommy Taylor, Liam Whelan, David Pegg and Geoff Bent.  Eight British sports journalists and several club officials have also been killed.  The Queen has said she is ""deeply shocked"" and has sent a message of condolence to the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.  The chartered aircraft was bringing the Manchester United entourage back from a European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia and had stopped at Munich's Riem Airport to refuel.  On the third attempt to take off the plane over-shot the runway, hit a house with its port wing, veered to the right, hit another building and burst into flames.  The fuselage did not catch fire and several crew and passengers went back into the wreckage to rescue the injured.  Team manager Matt Busby was described as being the most seriously hurt and is being given blood transfusions in hospital.  Star striker Bobby Charlton has been treated for slight head injuries.  According to the Chief Executive of BEA, A. H. Milward, there was a heavy snowstorm in Munich and the pilot delayed departure because he was dissatisfied with one of the plane's engines.  This was the first fatal accident for this type of BEA aeroplane, which has carried 2,340,000 passengers on 86,000 flights since it began service in 1952.  The same plane - called Lord Burghley - took the Manchester United entourage out to Belgrade on Monday."

219,"Radovan Karadzic is defending himself at the tribunal Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has lost his appeal that war crimes charges against him be dropped. He had appealed against a court ruling made in July that a trial would still be held despite his claim of immunity. But the court ruled that he should have more time to review documents before his trial at The Hague begins. It was due to start on 21 October but could now begin later, as Mr Karadzic has been given five days to review the prosecution's annotated indictment. The prosecution must produce the document by 19 October. Mr Karadzic is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide. The charges relate to the 1995 massacre of about 8,000 men and boys at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war. Mr Karadzic was arrested and brought to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) last year, after more than a decade in hiding. He denies all charges and wanted them dropped on the grounds that he was offered immunity by former US mediator Richard Holbrooke in 1996 if he left public life. The judges ruled on Tuesday: ""Even if the alleged agreement were proved, it would not limit the jurisdiction of the tribunal, it would not otherwise be binding on the tribunal and it would not trigger the doctrine of abuse of process.""

220,"A ban on right-hand drive vehicles came into effect in Cambodia on Monday, leaving thousands of cars liable to be confiscated by the government.  ""All kinds of right-hand drive vehicles will be seized and kept as state property if found in traffic in public after the deadline,"" a letter from the Transport Ministry warned.  About 80% of the 25,000 vehicles officially registered in Cambodia are right-hand drive, according to the ministry. The ban follows years of warnings for car-owners to have their steering columns changed from the right to left. It aims to stem the tide of smuggled and stolen vehicles from neighbouring Thailand, which has right-hand drive steering for Thai roads where drivers keep to the left. In Cambodia, a former French protectorate, motorists drive on the right-hand side. News agencies reported that many right-hand drive cars were still on Cambodia's roads on Monday. The government said that it had not began to implement the crack down yet because of the New Year's holiday.  The General Director of Transport Leng Thonyuthea told the French news agency AFP that all outlawed vehicles would be impounded and sent to garages to have their steering wheels changed. Cars that were not retrieved by owners would become state property, he said. The price of changing the steering column - ranging from $600 to $2,000 - is costly in a country where the annual income is less than $1,000. Many Cambodians are said to be unhappy with the ruling. ""A demonstration will be held if the government wants to confiscate our cars,"" taxi driver Ngeth Chay told AFP."
221,"But Volkert van der Graaf - sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment - was also a perfectionist with rigid morals who felt it his duty to protect weaker groups in society.  He saw Fortuyn as a threat to those groups, comparing his rise to that of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.  But he said during the trial that he was now ""struggling"" with the question of whether his act was acceptable.  Volkert van der Graaf is 33, Dutch, white and from the town of Harderwijk, east of Amsterdam.  An interview with Van der Graaf three years ago on the website of the group Animal Freedom - which stresses that he was not a member - reveals a man committed to animal rights from an early age.  At 15 years old, he worked caring for oil-covered birds in Zeeland.  As a student in Wageningen, home to a major university specialising in life sciences and agriculture, he joined an anti-vivisection group.  He was also active with the Inter-University Consultation on Animal Use - an organisation which he said aimed to reduce the use of laboratory animals in education.  At the time of the Animal Freedom interview, Van der Graaf said he worked for Environment Offensive, a group aimed at ""stopping the expansion of factory farming"".  ""Through legal procedures we fight permits for factory farms and fur farms, using the law as our tool,"" the interview reads, fuelling speculation that Van der Graaf had been angered by Mr Fortuyn's stated plan to lift restrictions on fur farming if elected.  Van der Graaf says his parents would not let him give up meat as a teenager, but he later became a vegan.  The text suggests a personal struggle with the ethical issues surrounding the human treatment of animals - ranging from concern for the worms he used while fishing as boy, to whether his diet should exclude ""eco-eggs"".  ""Many animal protectors act from the assumption that 'nature is good',"" he said, ""but every dark side of humans can also be found in nature"".  ""Protecting animals is civilizing people,"" he said.  A man said to be a member of Environment Offensive told Dutch television that Van der Graaf had started out believing that the law was his weapon.  ""Something must have gone wrong, something derailed,"" the activist was quoted as saying, referring to Fortuyn's killing.  On 6 May 2002, just nine days before the Dutch general election, Van der Graaf shot Fortuyn five times at close range as he left a radio studio in the central town of Hilversum.  He was arrested minutes after the shooting, and made a dramatic confession to the court at his first appearance there on 27 March.  The two-and-a-half week trial generated enormous public interest, and was frequently punctuated by vocal contributions from Fortuyn's supporters.  The final reading of the verdict - which fell short of the life sentence demanded by prosecutors - prompted booing and a mass walk-out from the courtroom."

223,"One September day in the late 1970s, Basil D'Oliveira was sunning himself on a Spanish beach with his family. A Spanish TV crew approached him and, in halting English, asked him for an interview. A bewildered D'Oliveira said: ""But you don't know who I am,"" only to be told: ""Oh yes, we all know about you.""  Basil's fame and popularity always amazed him. An essentially shy, private man, he remained deeply grateful to the British public for the support he received over the events of 1968 and continued to get until he finally retired in 1980.  I cannot think of another England cricketer who was applauded so warmly for such a prolonged period of time when walking out to bat - and, in his last season, even when he had failed, as he returned to the pavilion.  The British sporting public recognised a hero when they saw one. And Basil was exactly that.  Those from a younger sporting generation will wonder what all the fuss is about today, now that Basil's sad days suffering from Parkinson's disease are finally done.  Five Test hundreds and an average of 40 in 44 Tests is impressive, but no more than that. He did score runs when needed - he was no 'flat track bully' cashing in when there was little pressure. But you can say that about many other international cricketers.  Yet Basil was unwittingly one of the most influential cricketers of the 20th century - because of the colour of his skin.  He was 'Cape coloured' and he had to escape the dreadful limitations imposed by apartheid in the 60s to prove himself as a cricketer. The great cricket commentator John Arlott, a dedicated opponent of apartheid, managed to get Basil a Lancashire League contract, then he graduated to Worcestershire and finally made it into the England team when he was approaching middle age.  In August 1968, Basil made 158 against Australia in the final Test of the summer. When England won dramatically on the final day, with Basil taking a crucial wicket, we all waited eagerly for the news that he would be in the England party to tour South Africa that winter.  Shamefully, a few days later, the selectors bottled it and Basil wasn't picked. It was a major news story and became even more significant a week later when Tom Cartwright dropped out through injury and Basil was eventually selected.  The South African government, appalled at the opprobrium in Britain, cancelled the tour, saying the squad had been picked by the Anti-Apartheid Movement, not the MCC. South Africa would not play Test cricket against England again until 1994, with the D'Oliveira affair the catalyst for a sporting isolation that lasted more than 20 years.  During that time, many great South African sportsmen came to admit publicly that apartheid was obnoxious, that massive social and political changes were long overdue in their country - but everyone agreed that the dignity and integrity of Basil D'Oliveira were highly influential. He became a leading light for the instruments of change, without saying a word.  Basil relied on his professional performances and personal warmth to cement his place in the hearts of the British public. In private - especially after imbibing a beer or two - he was less discreet, but he handled himself superbly in public. He was a hero to so many around the world, even to those who had no defined views about apartheid.  In 1980, when I collaborated with him in his farewell to cricket, we deliberately called his autobiography 'Time to Declare'. In it, he stated for the first time that he was glad that the proposed South African cricket tour to England in 1970 was called off for fear of public disturbances.  And on a personal level, it was a huge thrill that Arlott contributed the foreword to the book, after being such a help to Basil down the years and a thorn in the side of the establishment through his anti-apartheid stance.  I recall standing with Basil at the Newlands ground in Cape Town during the Test against England in January 2000. He pointed to the trees that he used to stand under when watching the cricket as a boy coming from Signal Hill, dreaming his dreams.  He ruefully mentioned how comfortable the seats for the white spectators were and that he always supported South Africa's opponents in those days, just like Nelson Mandela.  He was wryly amused that he'd just been voted one of South Africa's 10 greatest cricketers, even though he had never played first-class cricket in his home country.  ""You should have seen me when I played at Signal Hill in my 20s,"" he smiled. ""I was some player then. I was over the hill when I came to England.""  Well he truly must have been some cricketer then. His crucial hundred in that Oval Test demonstrated his flair for the big occasion. He just had to get a big score after a poor Test series to get on that plane to South Africa.  That morning he rang his wife at home in Worcester and said: ""Pull up a chair, turn on the TV and enjoy it, Naomi, because I'm going to be there all day.""  He was, and he made his highest Test score. Yet the cup of triumph was dashed from his lips twice in a few days - first by the pusillanimity of the England selectors, then the intransigence of the South African government.  Yet you can't measure Basil's status in terms of England tours, championship honours with Worcestershire, the joy of seeing his son Damian succeed him in the Worcestershire side, his OBE award, and his coaching career at New Road that had much to do with the development of Graeme Hick.  He may have been in the twilight these past years, failing to recognise many who came to his nursing home to pay their respects, but he knew how loved he was around the world, especially in the city of Worcester, where he had been revered since arriving there with Naomi in 1965.  His significance will never be lost on those who maintain that sport and politics should never mix. But his popularity and personal example marked him out as a rare human being.  The dignity of the ordinary man could not be circumscribed by the evils of apartheid, as millions of remarkable people demonstrated. And Basil D'Oliveira was one of those."
224,"Ghulam Nabi Lone was shot at his home in the summer capital Srinagar and died on his way to hospital, police say.  At least three other people were killed in the attack, including one militant, police say.  Violence has continued in Kashmir despite the earthquake 10 days ago which killed more than 1,400 people in Indian-administered Kashmir.  As many as 40,000 people have died in the part of Kashmir administered by Pakistan, officials say.  Police say two militants scaled the wall of the minister's house, located in the high-security Tulsibagh area, and shot Mr Lone.  One militant died when security men at Mr Lone's house returned fire.  A policeman and a security guard have also died in the attack.  The militant group Al Mansurian called the BBC office in Srinagar and said it had carried out the attack.  The attack comes as aid workers have been struggling to reach the survivors of the devastating earthquake.  Last week, the Indian army said there had been no let-up in separatist violence in Kashmir despite the earthquake. The army had killed at least 29 militants in the past week, a military spokesman said.  However, an umbrella body of groups fighting Indian rule in divided Kashmir, the United Jihad Council, said it had called a temporary halt to operations against the Indian security forces.  India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in its entirety and have fought two wars over the region since independence."
225,"Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir has had a chequered history of elections reflecting the troubled politics of the state since its accession to India in 1947.  The first elections were held to the state's constituent-cum-legislative assembly in 1951.  It was a time when the influence of Sheikh Abdullah - the key figure in Kashmiri politics - was at its height and nobody from the opposition stood so ruling party candidates were returned unchallenged.  Sheikh Abdullah eventually fell out of favour with Delhi and was dismissed and jailed in 1953. But subsequent elections - in 1957, 1962 and 1967 - were widely regarded as being little better.  A prominent lawyer, Ghulam Nabi Hagroo, says that the elected MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) came to be known as ""made by Khaliq.""  This was a reference to a certain returning officer, Abdul Khaliq Malik, who was alleged to have found all sorts of ways to reject the nominations of any opposition candidates.  Sheikh Abdullah returned to the mainstream of Indian politics after an accord with the then Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, in the mid-1970s.  His National Conference party participated in the polls of 1977, which saw the largest turn-out of voters so far.  Although the state was then under direct Indian rule, the government in Delhi made it clear to everyone who mattered that it wanted a fair poll.  Sheikh Abdullah won a landslide victory, and his son and successor, Farooq Abdullah, won a huge majority in the elections of 1983.  But Farooq Abdullah fell out with India's ruling Congress party and the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, who had him dismissed the very next year.  But when Farooq Abdullah later agreed to an alliance with Congress, it turned many of supporters against him. It is widely believed that the elections of 1987 were rigged in favour of Mr Abdullah's party.  A leader of the Congress Party at the time, Khem Lata Wukhloo, recalls: ""I remember that there was a massive rigging in 1987 elections. The losing candidates were declared winners. It shook the ordinary people's faith in the elections and the democratic process.""  Many believe that these elections were a turning point in the history of Kashmir.  Many parties - like the Jamaat-e-Islami, the People's Conference and the Ittihad-ul-Muslimeen which were on the losing side - are now part of the main separatist alliance, the All Party Hurriyat Conference, campaigning for self-determination of the Kashmiri people.  More importantly, key figures in militant groups fighting against Indian rule - took part in the 1987 polls.  The APHC Chairman, Abdul Gani Bhat says the outcome seriously disillusioned many Kashmiris.  ""Kashmiri youths participated in the 1987 elections with great enthusiasm and seriousness and after due thought. But the poll results fired them with anger. They decided to fight violence with violence.""  Ever since the outbreak of the insurgency in 1989, militant groups have boycotted the polls on the grounds that they can't be a substitute for a plebiscite.  The elections of 1996 were held amid widespread allegations by ordinary people that the Indian troops coerced them into voting.  And the turnout was not more than 10% cent anywhere in the Kashmir Valley.  Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has promised that these latest elections n the state will be free and fair.  But the separatists have once again refused to participate, saying that they are not interested in governance till the basic issue of Kashmir has been resolved."

Sheikh Abdullah eventually fell out of favour with Delhi and was dismissed and jailed in 1953. But subsequent elections - in 1957, 1962 and 1967 - were widely regarded as being little better.  A prominent lawyer, Ghulam Nabi Hagroo, says that the elected MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) came to be known as ""made by Khaliq.""  This was a reference to a certain returning officer, Abdul Khaliq Malik, who was alleged to have found all sorts of ways to reject the nominations of any opposition candidates.  Sheikh Abdullah returned to the mainstream of Indian politics after an accord with the then Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, in the mid-1970s.  His National Conference party participated in the polls of 1977, which saw the largest turn-out of voters so far.  Although the state was then under direct Indian rule, the government in Delhi made it clear to everyone who mattered that it wanted a fair poll.  Sheikh Abdullah won a landslide victory, and his son and successor, Farooq Abdullah, won a huge majority in the elections of 1983.  But Farooq Abdullah fell out with India's ruling Congress party and the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, who had him dismissed the very next year.  But when Farooq Abdullah later agreed to an alliance with Congress, it turned many of supporters against him. It is widely believed that the elections of 1987 were rigged in favour of Mr Abdullah's party.  A leader of the Congress Party at the time, Khem Lata Wukhloo, recalls: ""I remember that there was a massive rigging in 1987 elections. The losing candidates were declared winners. It shook the ordinary people's faith in the elections and the democratic process.""  Many believe that these elections were a turning point in the history of Kashmir.  Many parties - like the Jamaat-e-Islami, the People's Conference and the Ittihad-ul-Muslimeen which were on the losing side - are now part of the main separatist alliance, the All Party Hurriyat Conference, campaigning for self-determination of the Kashmiri people.  More importantly, key figures in militant groups fighting against Indian rule - took part in the 1987 polls.  The APHC Chairman, Abdul Gani Bhat says the outcome seriously disillusioned many Kashmiris.  ""Kashmiri youths participated in the 1987 elections with great enthusiasm and seriousness and after due thought. But the poll results fired them with anger. They decided to fight violence with violence.""  Ever since the outbreak of the insurgency in 1989, militant groups have boycotted the polls on the grounds that they can't be a substitute for a plebiscite.  The elections of 1996 were held amid widespread allegations by ordinary people that the Indian troops coerced them into voting.  And the turnout was not more than 10% cent anywhere in the Kashmir Valley.  Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has promised that these latest elections n the state will be free and fair.  But the separatists have once again refused to participate, saying that they are not interested in governance till the basic issue of Kashmir has been resolved."
228,"Scenario one: The status quo Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 50 years. Currently a boundary - the Line of Control - divides the region in two, with one part administered by India and one by Pakistan. India would like to formalise this status quo and make it the accepted international boundary. But Pakistan and Kashmiri activists reject this plan because they both want greater control over the region.  In 1947-8 India and Pakistan fought their first war over Jammu and Kashmir. Under United Nations' supervision, they agreed to a ceasefire along a line which left one-third of the state - comprising what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern Areas administered by Pakistan and two-thirds, Jammu, Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley, administered by India.  In 1972, under the terms of the Simla agreement, the ceasefire line was renamed the Line of Control.  Although India claims that the entire state is part of India, it has been prepared to accept the Line of Control as the international border, with some possible modifications. Both the US and the UK have also favoured turning the Line of Control into an internationally-recognised frontier.  But Pakistan has consistently refused to accept the Line of Control as the border since the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley would remain as part of India. Formalising the status quo also does not take account of the aspirations of those Kashmiris who have been fighting since 1989 for independence for the whole or part of the state."
229,"Fiona believes that going to school in Kent played a big part in where she is today.     ""I went to King's Mead school which I absolutely loved and I still remember my days there. One of my most inspirational teachers was Mrs McKay. Mrs McKay always said to me 'remember me when you become a famous writer'. I was only little then but I loved English and you always remember when someone gives you great encouragement and she was inspirational. I loved that school."" As a little girl, Fiona lived in St Stephen's Close, off St Stephen's Road in Canterbury and remembers an idyllic childhood.     ""We used to walk across St Stephen's Road and there behind the houses was a great big field and the river Stour. We used to walk to school through those fields. And I remember going off on our own to fish, taking our nets and catching catfish, dogfish and eels from the river and I just loved it. We even loved the rats along the river.""    Fiona pauses and says: ""Please stop me if I'm rabbiting on. It's just like a stream of consciousness - I had such a wonderful childhood in Kent.""    Although Canterbury is Fiona's favourite place in Kent, she remembers travelling all over the county with her family.     ""We went all along the coast to Whitstable, Dungeness, Tankerton, Seasalter, Sandwich - all the seaside resorts. I used to love Dreamland at Margate; it was such a little child's idea of another world then. It was my Disneyland really.""     Even in her hectic GMTV schedule, Fiona still manages to return to the town of her birth.     ""I was back recently at Canterbury Cathedral because the Alzheimers Society had a big concert there. I love Canterbury so much; I think it's the most beautiful city. It was absolutely gorgeous to come back, it really made me feel so nostalgic."" The trip evoked so many memories that Fiona plans to return to the county, this time with her family. ""When we have spare weekend we will come down and bring the boys. I'll be doing that boring thing, you know, this is where mummy used to do this, this is where mummy used to do that!""    "
230,"She had performed the unusual feat of winning re-election, despite the mass unemployment her battle against inflation had seen.  But Thatcher took fewer votes than in 1979. Her landslide was caused by the almost equal split in support between Labour and the SDP-Liberal Alliance.  For Labour the 1983 election had been an unmitigated disaster. The only consolation for leader Michael Foot was that Labour had not lost second place to the strong challenge posed by the Alliance.  But although the Alliance could talk up the seven million votes it received it had actually won very few seats - leaving its dream of a breakthrough just that, a dream.  Margaret Thatcher's first administration got off to a fairly shaky start. Her attempt to take the economy by the scruff of the neck and wage a crusade against inflation saw massive unemployment.  If such voter anger was to continue the Conservatives looked like they would be continuing the by now familiar merry go round of Tory governments followed by Labour.  But luckily for the Conservatives Labour had troubles of its own - in spades. The adoption of the principled and high-minded Michael Foot as leader saw the party shift dramatically to the left in opposition.  Leading members of Labour's pro-European wing felt the party no longer had any place for them and in 1981 more than 20 MPs left Labour as Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers set up the Social Democratic Party.  The SDP quickly got into bed with the Liberals, forming the Alliance. The extent to which the new party captured the public imagination was shown when some polls placed them ahead of not just the Tories but Labour as well.  But their support was to wane with the onset of the Falklands War in 1982.  Thatcher's success in re-taking the Falkland Islands after an invasion by Argentina was a very risky venture, but for the loss of 255 servicemen the islands were re-taken.  This bold, decisive move seemed to have been in step with the times, and the Tories now had a grip on power that would remain unshakeable for years.  When the election date was set for 9 June 1983, the pollsters at least were certain that a Thatcher victory was inevitable.  Perhaps a more interesting fight would be the battle between Labour and the Alliance for second place.  Since going down to Thatcher's first election victory in 1979 Labour had changed leaders and marched firmly to the left.  Leading the party into his first and last election battle Michael Foot fought a poor campaign, lacking in organisation as well as the necessary money, not to mention a series of policies that the voters could not support.  The Alliance, although more measured in its pitch to the voters, also suffered from a lack of funds, and Roy Jenkins, its ""prime minister designate"" fared badly in his role as figurehead.  By contrast the Conservatives under Cecil Parkinson ran a highly professional operation.  Money was not a problem, new computer systems were invested in and new techniques such as direct mail were employed to good effect.  And stiff measures were taken against complacent Tory voters when around 1,000 copies of the Labour manifesto were bought and distributed to supporters to help remind them what a Labour government might entail.  The commanding figure of Margaret Thatcher, fresh from victory in the Falklands War, cast a dominant presence over the 1983 election.  The conflict, from April to June 1982, had succeeded in turning Thatcher's strong personality and resolve into a formidable electoral asset for the Tories.  Although in possession of a sharp mind, Labour leader Michael Foot was seen by few as the best possible choice for prime minister in what was presented as an electoral contest between Foot and Thatcher as much as it was between Tory and Labour.  Foot, a former journalist, was the choice of the party's left and his policies drew little support, even from the former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.  His leadership saw the Labour split that lead to the Alliance's birth.  Roy Jenkins, the former Labour chancellor and home secretary, was initially the key figure of their campaign but as he failed to create an impression with the voters his presence was scaled down, and the Alliance's ratings grew in response.  The Conservative manifesto, Forward - the Challenge of Our Times, showed a party hoping to become more radical during a second term.  Reform of the trade unions' political levy was floated, as was a programme of privatisation that was to include British Telecom, British Airways and British Steel.  And the metropolitan councils, all Labour strongholds, as well as the Greater London Council were to be scrapped.  Labour's left wing programme, rambling and radical in equal measure, was referred to by a member of the shadow cabinet as the ""longest suicide note in history"".  It contained pledges towards unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Community as well as the abolition of the House of Lords.  While the Alliance in its offering - Working Together for Britain - promised to reduce unemployment by up to a million.

232,"Reg Varney's first major TV role was in BBC sitcom The Rag Trade Comedy actor Reg Varney, best known for playing driver Stan Butler in ITV sitcom On The Buses, has died aged 92. He died following a short illness in a nursing home in Budleigh Salterton, Devon, where he had recently been admitted with a chest infection. His daughter Jeanne Marley, 59, said her father had died ""peacefully"" on Sunday afternoon. On The Buses was one of the most successful British comedies of the 1970s, with over 60 TV episodes. Varney's partnership with co-star Bob Grant, who played randy conductor Jack Harper, saw them become household names for a generation of viewers. The series, which ran for seven years from 1969 and spawned three feature films, followed the two characters as they dodged work and did their best to wind up inspector Cyril ""Blakey"" Blake, played by Stephen Lewis. Mrs Marley said he had only recently been admitted to the nursing home after he had begun suffering from a chest infection. She said: ""He's always been very young for his age. When he was in On The Buses he was playing a 35-year-old, but he was actually 50."" The On The Buses cast after Bob Grant's 1971 wedding to Kim Benwell Varney was born in east London as one of five children, and attended school in West Ham. He worked at the Regent's Park Hotel after leaving school, but went on to play the piano and sing in working men's clubs. Varney entertained the forces during World War II, where he served in the Royal Electrical Engineers, and later appeared in seaside shows and played pantomime dames. He first came to the public eye in BBC sitcom The Rag Trade, in 1961, and starred alongside Pat Coombs and June Whitfield in another comedy, Beggar My Neighbour, in 1966. In 1967, Varney opened the UK's first automatic cash dispenser in Enfield, north London. HAVE YOUR SAY I always find it upsetting when a comedian dies as they bring so much happiness to everyone. The success of On The Buses saw him land his own, self-titled TV series, as well as roles in films Go For A Take and The Best Pair Of Legs In The Business. Later in his career Varney spent time in Australia and New Zealand, sometimes working as a pianist. A remake of On The Buses was mooted in 1990, but failed to be commissioned. Varney had lived in Devon for the past 20 years, and had lived alone since his wife Lilian died in 2002. He is survived by his daughter, two grandchildren, and one great-grandchild."
233,"There are currently over a 100 female MPs in the House of Commons. The campaign for women to have the right to vote began in earnest during the second half of the nineteenth century. John Stuart Mill initiated the first debate in Parliament on the issue in 1867. From then on attempts were made to widen the franchise nearly every session, without success. Only one small advance was made - in 1869, when female ratepayers were allowed to vote in municipal elections. The cause took on a more militant aspect in the early 1900s with the formation of the Women's Social & Political Union and the activities of the Pankhursts which frequently led to imprisonment and even force-feeding of hunger-striking suffragettes. The onset of the First World War led to a ""truce"" to concentrate on the war effort, in which women were heavily involved. After the war, an electoral reform conference recommended a limited measure of women's enfranchisement. In 1918, women over 30 were given the right to vote, quickly followed by the passage of a law enabling women to be eligible for election as Members of Parliament at the younger age of 21. But only 17 out of 1,623 candidates at the subsequent general election were women. Christabel Pankhurst polled the most votes at the election but failed to gain a seat: the only woman to be elected, Constance Markievicz, did not campaign and, as a Sinn Fein member, never took her seat. The first woman to do so was Nancy, Lady Astor, elected for the Sutton division of Plymouth at a by-election in 1919. She made her maiden speech in February of the following year and, in 1923, piloted the first ever bill sponsored by a woman onto the statute book. The first woman minister was Margaret Bonfield in 1924 (Ramsey MacDonald's Labour government); she became a cabinet minister in 1929. Voting age for women was reduced in 1928 to 21 (the same as for men). It was not until after the Second World War that another milestone was reached - the first woman was nominated at the beginning of the 1946-7 session to the Chairman's Panel which allowed her to preside over a debate of the whole House in committee, which she did on 31 May 1948. The first woman to occupy the Speaker's chair was Betty Harvie Anderson (Conservative), appointed deputy chairman of the Ways and Means committee (a deputy speaker) in July 1970, taking the chair later that day during the Queen's Speech debate when she was addressed as 'Mr Deputy Speaker'. The first woman Speaker, Betty Boothroyd (Labour) was chosen in 1992 (in the first contested election since 1951). She had been a Deputy Speaker since 1987. Margaret Thatcher was, of course, the first female prime minister - from 1979 until her resignation in 1990, having been elected Conservative party leader in 1975, deposing Edward Heath. She holds the record for the longest serving twentieth century prime minister - eleven and a half years. Ironically, Mrs Thatcher's election to the premiership brought with it the lowest tally of female MPs (19) since 1951. This situation was reversed by the general election of May 1997, when a particularly large number of women MPs were elected to the Labour benches (101). In all 120 women were elected to Parliament in 1997.     "

Mr Brazier's broadcast showed an array of luggage and personal items, which he described as 'holiday paraphernalia', collected on the ground.  The media regulator Ofcom said it was assessing the complaints about the broadcast and had not yet decided if it would open an investigation.  A Sky News statement said that ""while presenting from the site of the MH17 air crash Colin Brazier reflected on the tragedy of the event and showed audiences the contents of one of the victim's bags.  ""Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on air. Both Colin and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused"".

237,"The militant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf is one of several guerrilla organisations involved in a resurgence of violence in the Philippines during the past year.  Previously a faction within the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), it split off in 1991 to pursue a more fundamentalist battle against the Philippine authorities.  It pulled off a major coup in 2000 when it kidnapped a group of foreign tourists from a Malaysian resort island.  The group operates in the south of the country, where other militants have been warring for almost 30 years for an Islamic state, independent of the mainly Christian Philippines.  Abu Sayyaf - or ""father of the swordsman"" in Arabic - was named after a mujahedin fighter in Afghanistan in the 1980s, where a number of its members fought against the Soviet-backed regime.  Hostage-taking is the latest in a series of actions which began in the early 1990s with a spate of bombings, assassinations and kidnappings of priests and businessmen.     In December 1994, the group bombed a Philippines Airlines plane on a flight from Manila to Tokyo, killing one passenger. But most of its activities have centred on southern Mindanao. An attack on the town of Ipil in 1995 left 50 people dead, and a grenade attack on a department store in Zamboanga in 1998 injured 60. Analysts say such attacks show the group - which is believed to have a core membership of around 200 - is trying to spark a religious war. The Philippines Government says Abu Sayyaf has been trying to evict Christians from its Basilan Island base.     As well as suspecting links with the mastermind behind the US World Trade Centre bombing, Ramzi Youssef, Manila believes it is connected to the man who tops America's most-wanted list, Osama bin Laden. Analysts say that Abu Sayyaf has received arms and munitions from Afghanistan.  The founder of Abu Sayyaf - Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani - was an Islamic scholar. He was killed in a clash with the Philippine Army in December 1998. The group responsible for the latest hostage-taking appears to be led by Galib Andang, also known as Commander Robot. He has been allegedly involved in earlier kidnappings. The Moros, who converted to Islam in the 14th century, have long resisted the Philippines' Catholic rulers, dating back to the Spanish colonial period.    Abu Sayyaf is the most militant of the anti-Manila groups and wants an independent Islamic state in Mindanao - an impoverished region with an annual income a mere fifth of the national Philippines average. Moderates are calling simply for the implementation of a planned 13-province autonomous region in the southern Philippines. Another group, the MNLF - from which Abu Sayyaf split - announced a ceasefire in 1996, and has been pursuing talks with government officials. A third group - the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which numbers around 15,000 fighters - had also started a ceasefire, but then halted all dialogue with the government after military assaults on its camps in July 2000."

The closure marks the end of shoemaking in the county. Managers at the Street-based footwear manufacturer told staff on Friday 8 January that the only way the company can survive is by switching production to the Far East. ""The cost of manufacturing in the UK has increased over the last 20 years, and we have been able to source our shoes cheaper in the Far East."" The closure of the plant near Ilminster marks the end of an era in Somerset. Although the firm's headquarters and warehouse will remain open, the factory in Dowlish Ford is its last manufacturing base in the county. Clarks Shoes began life as a sheepskin-tanning company in Street in 1825, branching out into footwear with the launch of a range of slippers in 1830.    Let us know your views on the factory closure, and the end of shoemaking in Somerset, using the form at the bottom of the page. One worker told the BBC in January: ""It has been on the cards for a long time and we've been fighting a losing battle for years now."" A union spokesman said that, although the announcement was expected, it had still shocked members. Managers responded that the move is essential for the company to survive. Spokesman John Keery said: ""The cost of manufacturing in the UK has increased over the last 20 years, and we have been able to source our shoes cheaper in the Far East.""

The Clarks made in England were the best and the new ones are not!! lorraine  clarks is the making of street. without the clarks famly it would not be the same. this was such a stupid idea to move from somerset to the far east. no wonder the quality of clarks shoes is not as good as it was Dorothy Green  I bought my first pair of Clarks Shoes in Norfolk, Nebraska at Brown's Shoe Store. I fell in love with the quality and fit. Since then I have continued to buy Clarks, however, the last pair I bought, approximately 2 l/2 years ago, and worn very little, have actually fallen apart. I purchased them from Dillards in Temple, Texas. I am very disappointed in the quality and will probably switch to another brand of shoes. John Robertson Veganline.com  I run a shoe shop and have tried to get Clarks to make my stuff to order for a long time. Answer always no. Big orders for their shop franchise or nothing.Now Mr Stables of Softwalker in Cumbria has bought the machinary and taken-on some of the staff from Clarks' canvas shoe factory - proabably this one - and is making all kinds of things with a minimum wholesale order of 12 pairs if you collect. He'll even make a single pair if you want to recycle your jeans into sandals. They're not massively expensive and of course he saves the massive admin costs of importing from the far east.I sell his sandals on my web site and a lot of other niche shops are selling the same thing. It turns out that a lot of people really want to buy fairtrade and European-made shoes, whatever the big companies say. Kathy  I hate to see this. Now I understand why I can't find a replacement pair of my favorite sandal, 'Clover' by Clarks and why I am seeing so many negative comments about the fit of Clarks shoes at different retailers. Good luck to all the former employees. Adrian Brittlebank  Yet another kick in the teeth for UK production. What do we actually still make in this country which won't be transferred to China? Joel Ramirez  To be honest they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Herman Riley Stein  I bought my first Clark's shoe, the Sandel, in 1946, in Los Angeles. I don't know where they were made..My next pair, a few years later were made in India and they were no to good..I bought another pair and they were made in Mexico and they were very good.....Then I couldn't get anymore. I had a Cobbler, in the State of Nebraska, take apart my Mexican pair and reproduce a new pair for me...They are still wearable...My Cobbler died and I can't find another in the USA. Do you still have Cobbles in the UK? I am now 85 years old and I would like to die with my Sandals on. One note, I AM SICK OF BUYING ALL CHINA...It is getting difficult to find a ""Made in USA""....Thanks for the space...hrs cARLEY AND ARABELLA  OUR VIEW IS THAT SOON EVERY THING WILL START TO BE MADE IN THE FAR EAST DUE TO THE CHEAPER LABOUR COSTS! WE NEED TO START LOOKING FUTHER INTO THIS ISSUE AND SOLVE IT QUICKLY! Renee  I've always loved Clarks and here in the U.S. were one of the few offering narrow sizing. I have noticed negative changes the last couple of years and now know why. I'm not buying anymore. bob brooks  Living in NZ now but originally from Axbridge, Somerset. Isn't globalization wonderful. Bob Manning  What is happening in SOmerset is happening all over the world. China and far eastern countries have a lower wage base and we cannot compete. Western countries would have to STOP buying all goods produced outside their country if any manufacturing is to continue in their country. China will flood the market with cheap produce and we will become Third world. Western companies are having their produces made in China, so that they can keep their heads above water. There is not enough pride or investment in our own countries to allow manufacturing to continue. Where does Somerset's futre lie. May be you can gro grass and manufacture cheese. I hear that Chinese cheese isn't that available Valerie King  This is a sad day for Britain. I love Clark's shoes, my favorites. And going to Street to buy bargains has been a part of my trips to England. I will still buy Clarks but I feel badly to see shoe manufacturing leaving both England and the United States. Alastair  I'm not surprised at this announcement and wonder why we even think of Clarks as a local business any more! Glenn Wallis  I think Clarks will regret closing their UK factories. Clarks is a British Brand and at least some if its shoes should be made here! The foreign produced shoes do not offer the same quality, it is corporate greed striking again. I will no longer shop at Clarks and I urge people in Somerset and the rest of the UK to question where their shoes are produced. Vietnam and China the main areas for Clarks new shoe production are not as ethically aware as the UK. Buy shoes online and buy British :) A.Mathur  There is no doubt that the price of shoes will remain the same and the only losers will be the workers in the Clarks factory, and the sweated labourers the managers will employ, on a ""contracted out"" manufacturing process. Everyone will be happy because the exploitation will be hidden by the distance of China from here. This is disgusting and I shall ensure that my family and friends do not buy any products with the Clarks label. Rod Harrison  Dismayed to see news of closure.I would suggest too high managemement costs and unnecessary expensive office buildings.Do we expect to see much reduced prices in view of cheaper labour costs and will quality slip? Anna Ashby  I will be moving to the area very soon. I think that this could have been foreseen. Perhaps a 'buy British' type promotion could have helped? Anyway, it is a really great shame. A F Wallace  Companies like Clarks do not care about the prosperity of the County or it's workforce. The bottom line is 'profit'. These companies moan about the increasing cost of running businesses in this country so they move overseas to countries that have lower overheads and cheeper labour however do they reflect this in the prices of their products made in these countries ?, of course not. 'Dyson' is a fine example of this. Since he moved his business to the Far East his products have gone up in price and Clarks shoes will be just the same. I refuse to buy products from such companies and I believe that more people should do the same. amanda chivers  The cost of making the shoes are said to be cheaper.But why are the price still going up.

242,"Apple Inc has agreed to start selling digital songs from its iTunes store without copy protection software. At present, most music downloaded from Apple's iTunes store can only be played through an iTunes interface or iPod. The agreement with Sony BMG, Universal, and Warner Music will end digital rights management (DRM) software currently attached to iTunes music. The changes were announced at the end of the keynote address, at the Macworld conference in San Francisco. Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, Phil Schiller delivered the speech, traditionally given by Steve Jobs. ""Over the last six years songs have been $0.99 [79p]. Music companies want more flexibility. Starting today, 8 million songs will be DRM free and by the end of this quarter, all 10 million songs will be DRM free,"" he told the crowd. Apple has also revised its pricing structure, offering a three-tier system with songs available for £0.59, £0.79 and £0.99. At present, the firm has a one-price-fits-all strategy - currently £0.79 per track - with no subscription fee. The new model will have a varied pricing structure, with what the company calls ""better quality iTunes Plus"" costing more. By the end of this quarter, all 10 million songs will be DRM free    The move could potentially spell the end for DRM limited music, which was never popular with users or the record industry. Mark Mulligan, a director with market analysts Jupiter Research, said the end of DRM in music- in its current form - was inevitable. ""The only reason it has taken so long is that the record industry has been trying to level the playing field, by giving away DRM free to everyone else, but even that hasn't dented Apple's share,"" said Mr Mulligan. ""Ultimately, what I think we're going to end up with [in the industry] is a new form of DRM. The more you pay, the less DRM you get bolted onto your music. Premium music will be DRM free, the cheaper it gets, the more shackles are attached,"" he added. In 2007 Apple's CEO, Steve Jobs, published an open letter called 'Thoughts on Music' in which he called on the three big record companies to ditch DRM.     "
243,"She had performed the unusual feat of winning re-election, despite the mass unemployment her battle against inflation had seen.  But Thatcher took fewer votes than in 1979. Her landslide was caused by the almost equal split in support between Labour and the SDP-Liberal Alliance.  For Labour the 1983 election had been an unmitigated disaster. The only consolation for leader Michael Foot was that Labour had not lost second place to the strong challenge posed by the Alliance.  But although the Alliance could talk up the seven million votes it received it had actually won very few seats - leaving its dream of a breakthrough just that, a dream.  Margaret Thatcher's first administration got off to a fairly shaky start. Her attempt to take the economy by the scruff of the neck and wage a crusade against inflation saw massive unemployment.  If such voter anger was to continue the Conservatives looked like they would be continuing the by now familiar merry go round of Tory governments followed by Labour.  But luckily for the Conservatives Labour had troubles of its own - in spades. The adoption of the principled and high-minded Michael Foot as leader saw the party shift dramatically to the left in opposition.  Leading members of Labour's pro-European wing felt the party no longer had any place for them and in 1981 more than 20 MPs left Labour as Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers set up the Social Democratic Party.  The SDP quickly got into bed with the Liberals, forming the Alliance. The extent to which the new party captured the public imagination was shown when some polls placed them ahead of not just the Tories but Labour as well.  But their support was to wane with the onset of the Falklands War in 1982.  Thatcher's success in re-taking the Falkland Islands after an invasion by Argentina was a very risky venture, but for the loss of 255 servicemen the islands were re-taken.  This bold, decisive move seemed to have been in step with the times, and the Tories now had a grip on power that would remain unshakeable for years.  When the election date was set for 9 June 1983, the pollsters at least were certain that a Thatcher victory was inevitable.  Perhaps a more interesting fight would be the battle between Labour and the Alliance for second place.  Since going down to Thatcher's first election victory in 1979 Labour had changed leaders and marched firmly to the left.  Leading the party into his first and last election battle Michael Foot fought a poor campaign, lacking in organisation as well as the necessary money, not to mention a series of policies that the voters could not support.  The Alliance, although more measured in its pitch to the voters, also suffered from a lack of funds, and Roy Jenkins, its ""prime minister designate"" fared badly in his role as figurehead.  By contrast the Conservatives under Cecil Parkinson ran a highly professional operation.  Money was not a problem, new computer systems were invested in and new techniques such as direct mail were employed to good effect.  And stiff measures were taken against complacent Tory voters when around 1,000 copies of the Labour manifesto were bought and distributed to supporters to help remind them what a Labour government might entail.  The commanding figure of Margaret Thatcher, fresh from victory in the Falklands War, cast a dominant presence over the 1983 election.  The conflict, from April to June 1982, had succeeded in turning Thatcher's strong personality and resolve into a formidable electoral asset for the Tories.  Although in possession of a sharp mind, Labour leader Michael Foot was seen by few as the best possible choice for prime minister in what was presented as an electoral contest between Foot and Thatcher as much as it was between Tory and Labour.  Foot, a former journalist, was the choice of the party's left and his policies drew little support, even from the former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.  His leadership saw the Labour split that lead to the Alliance's birth.  Roy Jenkins, the former Labour chancellor and home secretary, was initially the key figure of their campaign but as he failed to create an impression with the voters his presence was scaled down, and the Alliance's ratings grew in response.  The Conservative manifesto, Forward - the Challenge of Our Times, showed a party hoping to become more radical during a second term.  Reform of the trade unions' political levy was floated, as was a programme of privatisation that was to include British Telecom, British Airways and British Steel.  And the metropolitan councils, all Labour strongholds, as well as the Greater London Council were to be scrapped.  Labour's left wing programme, rambling and radical in equal measure, was referred to by a member of the shadow cabinet as the ""longest suicide note in history"".  It contained pledges towards unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Community as well as the abolition of the House of Lords.  While the Alliance in its offering - Working Together for Britain - promised to reduce unemployment by up to a million.  It also pledged proportional representation and devolution for Scotland and Wales, and called for compulsory balloting before unions could undertake strike action."
244,"A victorious Mrs Thatcher gave a speech from the steps of No 10...  Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan was forced to go to the country after his government lost a vote of confidence. Callaghan had had the option of calling an election in the Autumn of 1978, but decided to carry on and face the country after the economy had improved. Unfortunately the ""winter of discontent"" that followed severely damaged the government's economic policy and its standing in the polls. Although the government picked up slightly in the polls during the campaign, on 3 May 1979 Margaret Thatcher became Britain's first woman prime minister.  Callaghan had been Chancellor and Home Secretary in the 1964-70 adminstration and served as Foreign Secretary from 1974. He remains the only Prime Minister to have served in all three 'great offices of state' before entering Number 10.  Callaghan's parliamentary position became increasingly precarious. By April 1976 the government had lost its formal majority. The immediate reasons were a by-election defeat, the defection of two of Callaghan's backbenchers to form a new 'Scottish Labour Party' and the defection of the maverick John Stonehouse.  However, Callaghan managed to survive, mainly because the other opposition parties did not seem ready to unite to defeat him. By March 1977, after further by-election losses, he agreed to a parliamentary arrangement with David Steel and the Liberal Party which became known as the 'Lib-Lab Pact'.  The Lib-Lab pact ended in August 1978. The pact had been unpopular with some activists in both Parties, and in any case, an election was expected soon.  Callaghan could have gone to the country in the Autumn of 1978. The economy was improving and the Government had recovered some of its popularity. There was considerable speculation and controversy in the Cabinet about when the best time to go would be. Callaghan sought to end the speculation by singing an old Marie Lloyd song 'Waiting at the Church' to the TUC Congress. This was misunderstood in some quarters and he put the country's mind at rest in a broadcast in which he confirmed that he would not call an election until 1979. He was expecting that another round of pay policy would demonstrate to the electorate the success of his economic policy.  In the event, the pay policy did not hold and the scenes of industrial unrest were to be remembered as the 'winter of discontent'. Callaghan hoped to keep public sector pay claims under 5%. When tanker drivers forced the Government to give them a 14% raise, the flood gates opened. By the end of January, water workers, ambulance drivers, sewerage staff and dustmen were involved in industrial action, heralding the 'Winter of Discontent'.  When the devolution referenda were held, Wales voted 'no' and while Scotland voted 'yes' the majority was insufficient to make the decision binding. On the same day, 1 March 1979, the Government lost two by-election seats to the Conservatives. The SNP now withdrew its support from the Government and a vote of no confidence (on an SNP motion on devolution) was passed on 28 March. Callaghan called the general election for 3 May.  The Prime Minister pours scorn on the opposition as they prepare a vote of confidence . . .  One of the few surprises of the campaign was Thatcher's refusal to appear on the television programme Weekend World alongside Callaghan and Steel. Despite this, television coverage dominated the campaign as never before. All three major parties held morning press conferences co-ordinated for the cameras. Thatcher worked particularly hard to provide the media with photo-opportunities, whether it was by swinging her shopping basket, drinking tea in a factory or cuddling a new-born calf. David Steel was also camera friendly, although the media accused him of manipulating pictures by making sure he was filmed in narrow streets, giving the impression that he was surrounded by crowds of supporters.  The Government's manifesto, The Labour Way is the Better Way advocated an increase in pensions and tax cuts. However, opinion polls suggested the public believed the Conservatives were the party more likely to bring taxes down, spelling trouble for Labour. The Tory manifesto, The Conservative Manifesto 1979, promised to control inflation and keep the unions in check.  The one 'gaffe' of the campaign came from Sir Harold Wilson - the former Labour Prime Minister - who conceded in an interview with the Daily Mail that his wife might vote for the Conservatives, because their leader was a woman.  As the nation prepared to vote the Conservatives looked certain to win. They had put Callaghan through the wringer for Labour's handling of the economy. Their message was skillfully backed up by their advertising campaign directed by Saatchi and Saatchi, which claimed 'Labour isn't working'.  Shirley Williams lost her seat, as did Jeremy Thorpe, Emlyn Hooson, John Pardoe and Teddy Taylor, in what Margaret Thatcher called a 'watershed election'. John Major was among the new members returned at this election, as were Chris Patten, William Waldegrave, David Mellor, Ian Lang, Stephen Dorrell, John Gummer, and Frank Dobson. With a majority of 43, Mrs Thatcher had the opportunity to govern for a full term."

246,"The house with the narrowest front in the world has been sold in Scotland.  The one-bedroom property on the island of Great Cumbrae, off the North Ayrshire coast, has been bought by a family from Essex as a holiday home.  Measuring just 1.19m at its narrowest point the house called The Wedge, in Millport, barely has enough room downstairs for the front door.  Owners George and June Allison put it on the market for £27,000 in May.  But they refused to say whether they got their asking price for the property.  The paperwork on the sale, agreed earlier this year, was completed this week, according to Mrs Allison.  She said they had decided to sell so they had more spare time without having to look after the upkeep of the house which they had been renting out.  ""We are pleased to have sold the house and the people who have bought it are delighted with it.  ""They have connections to Millport and we are very happy for them,"" she said.  She said that the house included a small porch and a studio-lounge-cum-kitchen downstairs and upstairs had a bathroom or shower-room and bedroom.  The house is about 22ft long by 11ft wide or 6.7m by 3.35m, at its widest point.  When the couple bought the house 20 years ago they were oblivious to its record-making potential.  It was only when a newspaper reported a claim that the narrowest house was in the south of England that an architect friend of the couple suggested they measure their property.  So they got their tape measure out to record the exact measurements of their house they dubbed The Wedge because it was shaped like a wedge of cheese.  And the front of The Wedge measured just 47in or 1.19m.  This earned the couple's house a place in the Guinness Book of Records for having a property with the narrowest recorded frontage in the world."
247,"Honour killing is believed to have originated from tribal customs where an allegation against a woman can be enough to defile a family's reputation - 'a life without honour is not worth living.'  In some parts of the world, women who have been raped have also been murdered for the 'dishonour' of being a victim and the 'disgrace' it brings to their family.  More cases have reached the UK courts in recent years but a number of crimes still remain unresolved or undetected.  In many instances, the crimes are committed by family members against a female relative.  Victims have been killed for refusing to enter a marriage, committing adultery or being in a relationship that displeased their relatives.  Honour killing is the murder of a person accused of ""bringing shame"" upon their family.  Murders have sometimes taken place after a family reacted violently to their son or daughter adopting the trappings of western culture.  It's thought that up to 12 honour killings happen every year. They usually occur within South Asian and Middle Eastern families.  One of the most well-known cases is that of Banaz Mahmod, from Surrey, whose murder in 2006 was organised by her father and uncle.  She had left an unhappy arranged marriage after which she started a relationship with another man. The 20-year-old was strangled and hidden in a suitcase which was then buried underneath a Birmingham property.  The police were criticised for mis-handling Ms Mahmod's situation when she contacted them on a number of occasions before her death.  Shahien Taj, from the Henna Foundation, said: ""Honour is supposed to be a positive word. Clearly, calling a killing an 'honour crime' is a contradiction of terms.  ""A lot of talk and dialogue takes place after a crime has happened, but this is too little too late. If you really want to deal with an issue, you have to unpack it in its true context.""  Organisations that deal with honour-based violence also help forced marriage victims, as some of those killed in the name of ""honour"" were trying to escape coercion into matrimony.  Laws to prevent forced marriages and provide a way out for those already in unconsented unions were introduced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in November 2008.  Anybody convicted of trying to force someone into a marriage could be jailed for up to two years.  Within the first year, 86 Forced Marriage Protection Orders were implemented.  But as one worker who specialises in the issue said, ""The sticking point is that potential victims don't want orders served on their parents - or whoever is responsible - they just want a way out of the situation.""  In December 2009, the Metropolitan Police reported that there had been a huge rise in recorded incidents motivated by ""honour.""  They said 211 incidents had been reported in London - 129 of which were criminal offences - between April and October.  The increase may partly be due to police being instructed in September 2009 to assume honour crimes have been committed in more situations.  Nazir Afzal, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""It will be about making sure we look for the signs so that we don't miss cases.""  Detective Chief Inspector Gerry Campbell of the Metropolitan Police told The Guardian, ""Young woman are predominately the victims of honour-based violence but we are seeing an increase in young men and boys – it's now about 15% of the total numbers.""  He also added that 25% of their cases involved people under the age of 18."

""They had not had any food for a number of months and had been living off coconuts and fish.  ""He had given them as much food as he could spare, but the situation was quite dire.

249,"Pinsent replaced Jan Zelezny on the IOC's Athletes' Commission in 2001 while the three-time Olympic javelin champion concentrated on his training.  But the Czech athlete regained his place after an election in Athens.  The other successful candidates were Frankie Fredericks, Hicham El Guerrouj and Rania Elwani.  Pinsent will now relinquish his IOC role after the Athens Games.  The Olympic champion's failure to keep his place on the IOC will not affect London's chances of winning the 2012 Games, according to the bid team.

250,"He was catapulted to the leadership of the Congress party to fill the vacuum created by the assassination of the former premier, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1991.  He went on to lead India through a bold economic reform programme, laying the foundations for what has become one of the world's fastest growing economies.  But his tenure was also marred by the destruction of the ancient Babri mosque in the holy town of Ayodhya by Hindu nationalists in 1991.  It triggered widespread violence between Hindus and Muslims in which some 2,000 people died.  When Mr Rao became India's prime minister, he inherited a bleak economic situation with India close to bankruptcy.  It was a decisive period in India's move from a socialist-style economy to greater privatisation, engineered by Mr Singh who was to go on to become prime minister himself.  By the time Mr Rao was voted out of office in 1996 - the first Indian outside of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty to last a full-term - the economy was on a path of rapid growth.  But the shadow of religious violence also looms large on his legacy.  The destruction of the Babri mosque was seen as the most serious threat to India's secular identity since independence, and the failure of his government to protect the mosque cost the Congress Party significant Muslim support.  He and Congress were to suffer a humiliating defeat at the hands of India's voters in 1996. The loss of Muslim support and Mr Rao's inability to sell the reforms to the rural majority were seen to be the main reasons for the defeat.  Four years later he became the first Indian prime minister to be convicted of corruption.  The conviction was, however, overturned later.  PV Narasimha Rao was born on 28 June 1921 in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.  An astute and dour-faced politician with a trademark pout that was a cartoonists' delight, he was a lifelong loyalist of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, the dominant force in Indian politics since independence.  A scholar who could speak several Indian and foreign languages, he served under both Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv, as foreign, defence and home minister.  Like many politicians of his generation, Narasimha Rao's political activism dated back to the struggle for independence.  He was also a poet and writer and after his retirement he wrote a book following the career of a person rising through the ranks of Indian politics."
251,"Rajiv Gandhi is claiming a landslide victory in the Indian general election.  With almost half the votes declared early this morning, it became apparent that his Congress (Indira) Party had taken 80% of the seats and was well ahead of any opposition parties.  Although the final margin may be smaller, it is widely accepted that the Congress Party is likely to win a massive majority.  The opposition parties, which failed to unite against the Congress Party, have been all but wiped out, including the Hindu nationalist party, the BJP.  The BJP was expected to gain from the sectarian backlash following the assassination of Mr Gandhi's mother and the previous Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. She was shot dead by her own Sikh bodyguards in October.  The news was not all good for the Congress Party, however: in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, six cabinet ministers lost their seats to the Telgu Desam party.  The party's leader, Chief Minister and veteran film star NT Rama Rao, defeated an attempt by Indira Gandhi to dismiss him in August.  Mr Gandhi was told news of his triumph quietly at home in New Delhi, where he lives with his Italian-born wife, Sonia, and their two children.  His election follows two months as de facto prime minister since the death of his mother.  He has campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket, promising to rid the ruling Congress Party of a legacy of fraud and arrogance.  Known widely by his nickname of ""Mr Clean"", Rajiv Gandhi is seen as a break with the past of the Congress Party, which has held power in India for most of the last 30 years.  He is also seen as more pragmatic than his mother, and more liberal towards business.  But his opponents have accused him of relying on the ""sympathy vote"" for his victory, and one opposition MP commented that Indira Gandhi was ""ruling from the grave"".  Others point out his relative inexperience as a politician. Until four years ago, he was an airline pilot, but was persuaded to give it up to go into politics by his mother after the death of his younger brother, Sanjay."

253,"   Brown-necked ravens team up to hunt lizards, revealing an unexpected level of intelligence, say scientists. Ornithologists observed a number of birds acting together to trap and kill their prey in Israel's Arava Valley. Two of the ravens would fly to the ground to block the lizard's escape route, while the others attacked it. The behaviour suggests the birds must know what each other and the lizard are thinking, known as a 'theory of mind', say the scientists. Details of the behaviour are published in the Journal of Ethology. This is a live hunting expedition with the roles spelt out in advance. It is almost like an infantry assault    Professor Reuven Yosef of the International Birding and Research Centre in Eilat, Israel and his daughter Ms Nufar Yosef, a doctoral student at Tel Aviv University in Ramit Aviv, observed brown-necked ravens (Corvus rufficollis) hunting a large species of lizard called an Egyptian Mastigure (Uromastyx aegyptius). During more than 60 hours observing the birds, they watched nine separate hunts take place at two locations. In each hunt, a number of individual ravens, or pairs of birds, could be seen. But the birds did not flock together. However, when they sighted a lizard, the teamwork began. The birds would wait until the lizard had moved away from its burrow entrance. Then two birds circling overhead would fly in at high speed, landing at the burrow entrance. This effectively cut off the lizard's escape. The remaining ravens then targeted the lizard, pecking at it until they had killed their prey, before tearing off pieces to eat. Only when the lizard was evidently dead did the two ravens guarding the burrow entrance leave their post, and join in to feed. ""This is a live hunting expedition with the roles spelt out in advance. It is almost like an infantry assault,"" says Prof Yosef. The ravens succeeded in killing their prey on seven out of the nine hunts. He and his daughter, a psychologist, believe that the cooperative hunt suggests that brown-necked ravens posses what scientists call a 'theory of mind'. Initially, each raven must recognise that the lizard, which averages 75cm long and can weigh up to 1kg, is too big to take on alone. The reptile also possesses a heavy spiked tail that can easily injure a bird. Then for each bird to take part in the hunt, and fulfil a particular role, they must have some understanding of what each other is thinking, and be able to realise that by cooperating, they will share in the reward. To outwit the lizard, they must also have an understanding of how it will likely react. Other birds, including falcons, shrikes and Harris hawks, are known to hunt in pairs, with one bird flushing out prey into the path of another. Such hunts are usually performed by breeding pairs or related birds. But the ravens do not appear to be related, and seem more tactically astute. Corvids, the group of birds to which brown-necked ravens belong, have astonished scientists with extraordinary feats of memory, an ability to employ complex social reasoning and, perhaps most strikingly, a remarkable aptitude for crafting and using tools. Last year, a German team of scientists revealed that magpies could pass the Gallup mark test, an indication of whether they are aware of themselves. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. During the test, magpies marked with a coloured sticker under their beaks tried to remove it when presented with a mirror. So far, only some species of primates have consistently passed this self-recognition test, although more recent studies suggest elephants and dolphins may also respond. Corvids' tool-use may also rival, and even surpass, that of primates, such as chimpanzees. Wild New Caledonian crows craft tools to help them secure hard-to-reach food, for example. Western scrub jays intentionally deceive each other about the location of food stashes, while last year researchers discovered that rooks will team up to solve problems set for them in experiments. Earlier this year, scientists even showed that rooks will repeat one of Aesop's fables, by using stones in an experiment to raise the water level in a pitcher so it can reach the liquid to quench its thirst. Brown-necked ravens are a little studied species which breeds across north and central Africa to southwest and central Asia. It has been able to expand its range in part due to its ability to exploit human settlements built in desert regions.     "
254,"The United Nations chief refugee official, Sadako Ogata, has expressed doubts that Serb refugees from Kosovo will be able to return to their homes soon.  Mrs Ogata was speaking during a tour of Serbia, where she visited collective centres for Serb refugees from Kosovo and Croatia.  Serbia hosts the largest refugee population in Europe, with more than 700,000 refugees from the wars in the former Yugoslavia.  Mrs Ogata gave a stark assessment of the position of Serbs in Kosovo. The security situation in the province, she said, was not one in which the UN refugee agency could promote returns.  She said there were still people fleeing.

256,"Out of the wreckage of the old Yugoslavia a new union is currently being formed between Serbia and Montenegro. This act of creation is a sign that a great experiment in the 'land of the south Slavs' (which is what Yugoslavia means) is finally over. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. This decision in Belgrade's federal parliament to create a new loose union between the two republics, called simply Serbia and Montenegro, and to finally consign the name of Yugoslavia to history, shows how the legislators have bowed to reality. The real Yugoslavia perished in the 1990s, during the wars that consumed it. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. Its proponents thought that south Slavs, that is to say people with much in common, especially their languages, who lived in a great arc of territory from the borders of Austria almost to the gates of Constantinople (now Istanbul), should unite and form one great strong south Slav state. Ideas for a union of the southern Slavs had begun circulating at least as early as the 1840s. In the regions that were to become part of modern Croatia, thinkers dreamed of a new Illyria - a name harking back to the days of the Roman Empire. Amongst Serbs, however, such notions were less prevalent. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. Dreams of a union, state or empire came easily to the lands of the south Slavs because all of the people who lived in what was to become Yugoslavia were then the subjects of others. And the fault-lines of empire divided the south Slavs from one another. By 1912, however, the first of the wars that were to convulse this region periodically throughout the 20th century was about to begin. Two small Serbian and Montenegrin states had already emerged and become independent - having shaken off the Ottoman Turkish yoke - but the rest of what was to become Yugoslavia was still part of either the Ottoman or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. With the first Balkan war of 1912 all that began to change. The new small states of Serbia and Montenegro, fighting alongside Greece and Bulgaria, managed to push the Turks back to Constantinople. Serbia and Montenegro conquered Kosovo, and Serbia took a large share of Macedonia. For many Serbs and other Slavs living within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Serbia was their champion. Inspired, and also helped, by Serbia's secret services, one of these young radicals took a pot-shot at the heir to throne of Austro-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand, who was visiting Bosnia on 28 June 1914.  Within months the old order was gone. The assassination in Sarajevo sparked off World War One, which in its wake destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Empire. What was to replace it? Many Croat, Serb and other south Slav soldiers remained loyal to Austria-Hungary during the war, but there were also some who did not. Indeed, some of its politicians feared that as Austria-Hungary crumbled Italy would seize as much of the coast of Dalmatia as it could, while Serbia would create a new greatly enlarged Serbian state, including Bosnia and parts of what are now Croatia - especially those areas that were then heavily inhabited by Serbs. The politicians felt that a deal must be reached with Serbia. A new union was to be proclaimed. The Serbian Army would save Croatia and Slovenia from the territorial ambitions of the Italians, and union would also save Croatia from Serbia itself. The kingdom was formed on 1 December 1918. Serbia's royal family, the Karadjordjevics, became that of the new country, which was officially called the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929 - when it became Yugoslavia. The country was carved up. Immediately it became clear that the union was not a happy one. Many Croats especially resented it, because they felt they had exchanged the domination of Vienna for that of Serbian Belgrade. Kosovo's Albanian population was restive too. Albanians were not Slavs and were bitter that Kosovo had not been able to join the newly independent Albania (which proclaimed its independence in 1912). Macedonian nationalists also resented the new state. So Yugoslavia lurched from crisis to crisis until finally it collapsed, with barely a fight, in 1941 - when attacked by Nazi Germany and Mussolini's fascist Italy. The country was carved up. A tiny extreme fascist quisling clique, known as the Ustashas, was installed in power in the Croatian capital Zagreb. They began a campaign of terror and genocide directed especially at the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia. Resistance soon began to emerge. In Serbia so-called Chetnik forces loyal to the old Serbian-dominated Yugoslav order began to fight, and so did a communist dominated resistance under the half-Slovene half-Croat Josip Broz - also known as Tito.  The war years were a nightmare of inter-ethnic bloodletting, fighting and wars within wars. While Yugoslavia was occupied and resistance was directed against the occupiers, in fact the majority of those who died, did so in fighting between nationalists of various stripes - royalists, communists, quislings and so on. Tito's forces, however, soon gained the recognition and help of the Allies. They also offered an ideal - a dream of 'brotherhood and unity' - that would link the nations or peoples of Yugoslavia. By 1945 Tito's forces were victorious, and crucially, although the Soviet Red Army had helped in the struggle, it had now moved on to central Europe. So Tito, not Moscow, would shape the new state. But Tito was a communist, loyal to Stalin. He wanted to model his country on the Soviet Union, so a federal state of six republics was proclaimed (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia). Stalin was wary of Tito, however, and in 1948 the two fell out. Yugoslavia was expelled from the communist bloc but Tito did not fall from power, as many had expected. He survived, and began to chart an independent course for the nation he ruled. Over the next 40 years Yugoslavia changed beyond recognition. It developed its own brand of socialism, and a society far more open than that of its communist neighbours. For them, and for many communists around the world, Yugoslavia seemed to be a paradise on earth. At home the federation appeared to have solved the bitter national questions of the past, living standards were high and, unlike in other communist countries, citizens were free to travel to the west, either to work or to take holidays. Tito's Yugoslavia also gained enormous prestige as a founder of the non-aligned movement, which aimed to find a place in world politics for countries that did not want to stand foursquare behind either of the two superpowers. Even liberal communism had its limits... Despite all this, and although there was much substance to Tito's Yugoslavia, much was illusion too. The economy was built on the shaky foundations of massive western loans. Even liberal communism had its limits, as did the very nature of the federation. Stirrings of nationalist dissent in Croatia and Kosovo were crushed. The federation worked because in reality the voice of only one man counted - that of Tito himself.  When Tito died in 1980, Yugoslavs were shocked and apprehensive. They had been prepared for his demise with the slogan 'After Tito - Tito'. But there was no new Tito. Without him the state began to unravel, as the governments of the republics began to exercise the powers that were due to them under the constitution. Dissent began to grow. Serbs complained of persecution at the hands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Croats and Slovenes resented the fact that money earned from tourists in their republics went to subsidise poorer parts of Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo. Albanians there demonstrated for their own republic, and even for secession and union with Albania. ...by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. Managing these strains and crises was hard enough, but by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. And if it was, what was to replace it? For Slobodan Milosevic, an up-and-coming politician in Serbia, the answer was nationalism. Seizing on the delicate issue of Kosovo, Milosevic came to supreme power. And so, Yugoslavia began to crumble. In 1989 Milosevic abolished Kosovo's autonomy. Croats and Slovenes feared that they were next in line. In this way a spiral of competitive and mutually fearful nationalisms began to destroy the country. Politicians fanned the embers of all the old divisions - Serbs versus Croats, Orthodox Christians versus Catholics versus Muslims, and so on. Milosevic clearly wanted to dominate all of the old Yugoslavia, but when he realised that he could not, he switched to another option, that of a Greater Serbia. History had scattered the Serbs especially, well outside the borders of Serbia. Milosevic argued that the federation meant that nations could secede from it, but not republics. So, he said, Slovenia - with no indigenous minorities - and Croatia could leave Yugoslavia if they wished - but then Croatia could not take its Serb areas with it. The stage was set for war. The stage was set for war. The story of those conflicts in Slovenia, in Croatia, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and finally NATO's war in Yugoslavia, has been told many times.  Now, prosperous Slovenia is looking forward to EU and NATO membership. Croatia is recovering from war, and its territory is intact, although most of its Serbs have fled or been driven out. Bosnia is divided into two, a shattered land still struggling to overcome the legacy of the war. Macedonia has been riven by ethnic conflict - but spared all-out war - between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians returned to Kosovo after the war there, but then 230,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians were forced to flee. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. Serbia and Montenegro have been impoverished by the wars and even today - as their new union is being formed - their future state is far from assured. Serbs and Montenegrins have much in common, especially their common Orthodox heritage, but Serbia is a land of some eight million people, and Montenegro has only 650,000 citizens. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. The new deal is for a loose union for three years, after which either republic can opt for independence. On paper it is a sensible compromise. In reality it will be hard, but not impossible, to make it work - if there is enough goodwill. The new deal, however, makes no provision for Kosovo, a UN protectorate since 1999, but still nominally part of Yugoslavia - or now its successor state. Its majority Albanian population has no intention of ever entering any new union with Belgrade, while its Serbs have no intention of permitting it to take the path of independence. If they can't prevent independence they (and the policymakers in Belgrade), would probably like to partition it, with the northern Serbian inhabited areas staying within Serbia. So, the final disintegration of the old Yugoslav state is not yet complete. Having taken their different paths, the people of the former Yugoslavia will look back on the past with different and mixed emotions. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country, and in Serbia and Montenegro most people are simply too exhausted by the conflicts of the past and the difficulties of life to really care. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country... But throughout the old Yugoslavia, and especially amongst those who grew up under Tito (except perhaps the Kosovo Albanians), the passing of its name will leave many with a wistful feeling - a feeling for which, indeed, they already have a name: Yugonostalgia."

260,"I’m James Thornett, Head of the BBC Homepage product, and I want to tell you a bit about the new homepage we’ve launched in beta mode for public use and feedback today. The beta is accessible from a promo at the top of the current homepage (or directly at beta.bbc.co.uk), and demonstrates a new ‘visual-first’ approach to showcasing the breadth of our content on the web.  My colleague Phil Fearnley has written about the re-launch from a strategy perspective over on the About the BBC blog, situating the BBC Homepage product within the context of a reshaped BBC Online.  As Phil suggests, a homepage by definition should bind all of the other products together and has an important editorial role to play.  But showcasing the breadth of BBC Online content within a single page has been our constant challenge. To date we’ve made tweaks to a relatively static page to better fulfil this purpose; with the move to a new technical platform, we’ve the opportunity to rebuild the page from the first principles to provide a more effective solution.  To the left of the picture you can see the evolution of the page over recent years, from 2005 to 2010. The first thing you’ll notice is that the page hasn’t changed very much in this time – column-based, modular, with an evident hierarchy of information reflecting the primacy of news and sport.  There have been few new features since January 2008 when we introduced customizable and movable widgets to enable users to determine page layout, and the ability to listen live to BBC radio directly from the homepage and to browse BBC TV schedules.  The BBC Homepage is the most visited product within BBC Online behind BBC News and BBC Sport.  There was a weekly average of 9.1 million unique browsers across all devices in July this year [source: BBC iStats] – impressive for a page typically considered more a site entry point, than a destination in itself. But:- the trend since 2008 has been one of gradual decline, and more recently a plateau in visits.  There could be various reasons for this – we’ve learned: The homepage is too narrow in focus. It refers a significant proportion of traffic to the BBC News and BBC Sport products – 44% and 35% to each respectively during July this year.  The primacy of links to these products has attracted an audience skewed more towards ‘male’ and ‘ABC1’ demographics than BBC Online as a whole. The page lacks distinctiveness. Research groups show that the homepage is often confused with the BBC News front page.  This could be a testimony to the profile of other BBC Online products – for instance, we know thatover 70% of users arriving at the BBC News front page come direct rather than via the homepage (another reason why the homepage needn’t serve as a conduit for BBC News stories exclusively). Clearly, there’s scope to make the page a better referrer to the other products of BBC Online.  Further: Users want to be able to filter content, not customize. The homepage has historically enabled a measure of customization but the majority of users haven’t taken advantage of this.  When customization features are highlighted, the perceived value is mixed; instead users tell us they place a higher value on being able to easily filter content, than re-order what’s already there. And so we arrived at a vision for the new BBC Homepage.  By showing less of more, we’ve the opportunity to make the page more relevant for a broader audience. In doing this we enable the sort of ‘serendipitous’ discovery that Director of Future Media Ralph Rivera has talked about – if someone comes to the BBC to be informed, why shouldn’t they encounter content that will educate and entertain them also?  Enabling these connections will become an increasingly important part of our public-service mission in a digital age and the new BBC Homepage is proof of our commitment in this respect. We think the idea of audiences coming to the page for the things they need, and coming back for the things they discover is very compelling, and we’ve kept this front of mind during the redesign.   We’ve created an interactive guide to the new BBC Homepage, accessible from a link at the top of the beta page, or directly here. The BBC Homepage beta will be released in stages, and includes a raft of functional improvements for audiences: Visual-first design with carousel featuring colour coding to denote categories and icons to depict content type. Simple filters enabling users to simply tailor the page based on interests. Sliding ‘drawers’ to reveal more or less detail across showcases of most popular content across BBC Online at any time and real-time listings for BBC TV and Radio. At-a-glance aspects – news and sport headlines, weather forecasts with lottery and travel news updates to follow, plus traditional index-based navigation for quick look-up.  In time, separate nations’ homepages united into a single product to provide relevant local and national information based on a user’s choice of location.  We’re particularly pleased with the carousel – it feels like an intuitive way to navigate content which test groups have said feels “just like flicking through a magazine”.  There’s a general sense too that the dynamic page does a better job of showing the breadth BBC web content than a static page could.  We think the carousel could find feet in the other products of BBC Online, and lend itself to screens beyond the web: in time we’ll look to optimise the homepage across mobile (the page receives 15-25% of traffic from handsets), tablet, and connected TV devices. Tell us what you think As with any beta, this release is very much work in progress and will run alongside the current homepage for the time being.  We’ve built the foundations and are now keen to start to get feedback from users in order to refine the page further before replacing the existing page with this version. We’d like to know your thoughts so post a comment under this blog, tell us what you think on Twitter using the #bbchomepage hashtag, or privately via this survey. In the coming weeks we’ll be rounding up key themes and addressing these on this blog so watch this space.  You’ll also hear from others who worked on the project – from a detailed ‘under the bonnet’ tech view to the user experience and design story.  In summary, we’ve been making improvements progressively to the BBC Homepage since BBC Online launched in 1997.  The beta version launched today represents a real step change – we’ve rebuilt to deliver an intuitive, location- and time-aware experience which makes it easier for users to explore the wealth of BBC content on the web than ever before.

261,"The BBC Homepage in Gaelic, for a user in Glasgow  Back in November when the new BBC Homepage launched, my technical counterpart James Thornett and his boss Phil Fearnley described how the team intended to evolve the product over time and improve the homepage for all users.  As homepage editorial lead, I'm happy to announce a significant new development as the BBC nations' homepages become an integral part of the main homepage product.  From today, if you change your location to a place in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, you will see navigation and content from the country you've selected, alongside other content of interest UK wide.  This change enables us to more fully and appropriately respond to cultural, political and topical interests across the UK.  From next week, users who set their location in the Nations will be able to navigate between different editions of the homepage - so if you're in Scotland, for example, you will be able to see:  This week, we're giving users a sneak preview of the five new homepages before making the final switchover next week:  Today's launch marks an important step in the journey towards offering users the opportunity to personalise their homepage.  And in uniting our homepages within a single set of technologies, we have eliminated the need to build, service and maintain separate sites.  This saves money, and means that nations and indigenous language homepages will develop iteratively alongside the UK-wide editions. The site continues to develop so your comments and feedback are very welcome."

No other offer exists like this anywhere else in the world.  Democracy Live will provide unmediated content straight to the public who can view information first hand and through the various features find out about their elected representatives and the decision-making process.  The extensive guides, search facilities and the easy navigation are designed to ensure Democracy Live provides information for people with different levels of interest, supporting the BBC's commitment to build a greater understanding of the democratic institutions amongst the public.  Head of BBC Political Programmes, Sue Inglish, said: ""Democracy Live is an important addition to the way the BBC brings politics to our audiences across the UK, allowing people to see first hand the work of their elected representatives and ensuring we have a healthy and informed democracy.  ""This is precisely the sort of different content the BBC should be providing in fulfilling our public service remit and representing all of the democratic institutions in the UK.""  The key feature of the Democracy Live home page is an eight-screen video wall covering full sittings of the institutions and committee proceedings.  The search engine is based on an innovative ""speech-to-text"" system which allows users to search the video for specific topics and contributors from the Democracy Live archive. The archive holds the items of business which have been covered live on the site.  In addition to live and on-demand coverage, Democracy Live features a Historic Moments section containing video of memorable political events over the past two decades.  Democracy Live also offers guides to each of the institutions and an explanation of how the UK's devolved political system works. People will be able to follow representatives they are interested in and Democracy Live will gather video in which they appear and store this to be watched later.  A Comment section brings together all of the BBC's main political blogs and offers a place for public figures to explore topical issues.

Democracy Live will cover all proceedings in the main chambers of the House of Commons, House of Lords, Scottish Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly, Welsh Assembly and full sittings of the European Parliament.  It will also cover Westminster Hall and Select Committees at Westminster.  When there is no business in the main chambers in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, it will cover committee meetings.  Each of the institutions has its own section which outlines the business that is covered on Democracy Live that day.  The section covering the Welsh Assembly is also available in Welsh. The speech-to-text system has also been developed for Welsh language proceedings, the first time the technology has been used in this way.  In addition to the small Democracy Live teams based in each of the nations, Democracy Live at Westminster is produced from a newly-built newsroom jointly with the digital TV channel BBC Parliament."
263,"The DUP leader released his statement after confusion about exactly what occurred in Stormont on Friday morning.  In his speech, Mr Paisley said the circumstances had not been reached where there could be a nomination or designation by his party.  Other parties said that the DUP position needed to be clarified.  Mr Paisley said in the assembly chamber: ""There can only be an agreement involving Sinn Fein when there has been delivery by the republican movement, tested and proved over a credible period in terms of support for the PSNI (the police), the courts, the rule of law, a complete end to paramilitary and criminal activity and the removal of terrorist structures.  ""Clearly, as Sinn Fein is not yet ready to take the decisive step forward on policing, the DUP is not required to commit to any aspect of power-sharing in advance of such certainty.""  However, the two governments later said that it was his intention to accept the nomination after ""all the conditions agreed at St Andrews have been met"".  Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said Mr Paisley has now provided the clarity that was missing from his statement in the assembly.  Mr Ahern said the statement was welcome and had removed the doubt that had been raised about the DUP's approach to power-sharing.  A group of DUP assembly members also said their party had not taken part in any process to nominate a team to head up a future Stormont administration.  After the abandoned assembly meeting, 12 DUP assembly members signed a statement saying that they not had taken part in a designation process.  It said ""nothing that we have said or done"" could be taken by the government as such an indication.  The statement was signed by four of the party's nine MPs.  Nigel Dodds, the Rev William McCrea, Gregory Campbell and David Simpson all signed the statement.  It read: ""Given the total lack of movement on behalf of Sinn Fein on the issue of support for the rule of law, the courts and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, nothing that we have said or done today can be taken by the Government as an indication that they can imply shadow, designate or any other status to anyone in relation to the Office of First and Deputy First Minister.""  It was also signed by Lord Morrow and his fellow assembly members Diane Dodds, Paul Girvan, Stephen Moutray, Nelson McCausland, Mervyn Storey, Tom Buchanan and assembly deputy speaker Jim Wells."
264,"The party's ruling executive overwhelmingly passed a resolution understood to offer a definite date for going into government with Sinn Fein.  The government has previously said Stormont will be dissolved if Monday's devolution deadline is not met.  Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the DUP was seeking to ""frustrate the will of the electorate"".  He said commitments to dissolve Stormont in the absence of agreement must be kept.  ""If the DUP wants a functioning assembly after March 26 this can only happen through direct dialogue and agreement with Sinn Fein and the other parties,"" he said.  ""In the meantime the two governments must now proceed to put in place their all-Ireland partnership arrangements.""  Government sources told the BBC Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain has yet to be informed of the DUP executive's resolution.  The sources said the government would not produce the emergency legislation the DUP wanted and there had been no agreement to defer water charges.  If there is no deal by Monday's devolution deadline, the government's view is that the assembly will be dissolved and it will be up to the parties to agree a position amongst themselves.  DUP leader Ian Paisley said the details of the resolution would be released after negotiations with the government are concluded.  ""The Ulster people will be persuaded, they will not be driven,"" Mr Paisley told reporters after the DUP meeting.  The party is thought to have offered to take part in a meeting of the Programme for Government committee featuring both Mr Paisley and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.  Earlier, Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey said he thought the government may be intending to legislate for a delay to the return of full devolution.  Sir Reg said he understood an eight-week delay was under consideration.  Secretary of State Peter Hain has consistently denied there will be any emergency legislation to alter Monday's deadline.  The 120-strong DUP executive meeting has been described by some party figures as the most important in its history.  Mr Paisley held talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair twice within 48 hours this week.  After the second meeting, Downing Street re-iterated that Monday's deadline stood.  Mr Paisley said a ""great deal of ground"" had been covered.  However, he earlier said a financial package offered by Chancellor Gordon Brown did not meet Northern Ireland's economic needs.  Mr Brown has promised an extra £1bn if devolution is back on Monday.  The cash is on top of £35bn promised by the government over four years.  The Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended since October 2002, amid allegations of an IRA spy ring at Stormont.  A subsequent court case collapsed. Direct rule has been in place since that date."
265,"Average-priced homes in 548 out of 597 main UK postal towns were beyond the means of people on average salaries, according to the study.  The problem of affordability is most acute in the south of England, where house prices have outpaced earnings.  Toughest of all is Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire, where a home costs 18 times the average income.  At the other end of the scale, Lochgelly in Scotland is the most affordable town, with property costing just three times the average salary.  In England, Nelson in the North West is the most affordable location for first-time buyers, with property costing 3.24 times the average salary.  Halifax defined a town as unaffordable for first-time buyers if the average property price was more than 4.37 times the average salary.  Using this method, Halifax found that 95% of towns in the South East, East Anglia and the South West were unaffordable for first-time buyers.  But in Scotland and Northern Ireland, just 19% and 25% of towns respectively were deemed unaffordable.  Halifax chief economist Martin Ellis said that first-time buyer numbers are at their lowest level since 1981.  ""Affordability has become a serious issue, making it very difficult for those looking to get onto the housing ladder for the first time.""  However, Mr Ellis added that the slowdown in the housing market in recent months offered fresh hope to first-time buyers.  ""We expect the situation to improve somewhat as earnings growth outstrips house price growth over the next few years.""  ""This will make it easier for first-time buyers, thereby boosting the number from its current historically very low level.""  Gerrards Cross estate agent Michael Day, said: ""People want to move somewhere a little leafier, which have good schools and transport links.  Mr Day, the managing director of Integra Property Services, said: ""They say three factors sell a house: location, location, location. Gerrards Cross has all of them.""  But one Scottish mortgage consultant said he was ""mystified"" as to why Lochgelly was the cheapest town.  James Marman at Delmor Estate Agents, in nearby Cowdenbeath, said about 9,000 people lived in Lochgelly, with three primary schools, one secondary school, a loch and golf course.  He said: ""There is a real mixture of people - from first time buyers to people who have moved to the area to retire - and those who have lived there for their entire life.""  On average, a three-bedroom terraced house would cost around £75, 000 in Lochgelly, he said.  By contrast a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Gerrards Cross would cost about £470,000, according to Rightmove property website."
266,"Following the revelations that children's heart surgery will stop at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital, BBC News has spoken to parents of children who will be affected.  Danielle Westerman's two-year-old son Declan has had two open-heart operations and is due to have another next year.  Ms Westerman, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, says she already has trouble getting to Leicester as neither she or her partner can drive and rely on a lift from her elderly grandfather.  She said: ""Where would we have to go now? How would we even get there?  ""Glenfield is only an hour away from me, this is going to be so difficult. We struggled as it was.""  NHS England has told three units - in Leicester, Manchester and London - to stop complex surgery on patients born with congenital heart problems by April 2017.  The announcement comes after attempts to reorganise services had to be abandoned three years ago following legal challenges by local campaigners and the hospitals themselves.  Ashleigh Woods' six-year-old son Jack has had open-heart surgery four times at Glenfield.  Ms Woods, from Melton Mowbray, said: ""We nearly lost him two years ago and he will need a heart transplant eventually.  ""This has come as a massive shock. Where do we go? Birmingham is such a long way to go, it's risking your child's life.  ""Will they pay travel costs? At Glenfield you can stay over.  ""It's daunting to think what will happen. It will have a massive impact on us.""  Sylv Hogan's son 12-year-old son Alex was was born with a congenital heart defect.  She said Alex had ""infection after infection"" from birth and in March 2005 he took a turn for the worse and was admitted to the Leicester Royal Infirmary.  ""He was too poorly to be moved to Glenfield so we held our breath and waited,"" she said.  ""Doctors from the heart unit came over every day to check on Alex until he was stable enough to move.  ""I'm 100% sure that he would not be here today [without their help].  ""[Stopping children's heart surgery at Glenfield] is not sad, it's criminal.""  Card Ward, from Leicestershire, said his one-year-old son George has undergone two open-heart surgeries at Glenfield and is fortunate to be alive.  He said: ""We feel absolutely mortified about the recent news, I feel sick to the stomach.  ""Glenfield became a second home for us. Me and my partner were so fortunate to be able to commute the 20-minute drive, change shifts to stay with George and the other look after our other son at home after school.  ""I feel so sad for Leicestershire and surrounding areas, in fact the whole country, as we met children who had been airlifted from hundreds of miles away to receive the special care and expertise.""  Ranjit Singh Nagra, from Leicester, said on Facebook: ""What a disgrace, my daughter had a heart surgery at Glenfield hospital and I feel sorry for the children and parents who will have to travel miles for surgery.""  Hayley Spencer told the BBC the NHS England decision was ""terrible news"".  ""My little boy River had open-heart surgery in October for tetralogy of Fallot [heart defect],"" she said.  ""What happens if he needs more surgery? Where will we go? Glenfield is so handy for us living in Derby.""  Sharon Virgin, from Leicester, said: ""My daughter needs open-heart surgery in a few months and she is devastated.  ""They are not thinking how this will affect the children who basically live at the hospital. They should be ashamed of themselves.""  Giles Peek, now a professor of paediatric heart surgery in New York but who used to be in charge at Glenfield, said the unit supported every hospital in the East Midlands and its closure could mark the ""death of paediatric services"" in the region."
267,"Children's heart services in Leicester have been secured after a new vision was approved by a national board.  The unit at Glenfield Hospital was threatened with closure in 2012 with the nearest service in Birmingham.  A series of changes have now been proposed by NHS England following a national review into children's heart services across the country.  University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said the changes would see the unit move to Leicester Royal Infirmary.  On Thursday, NHS England unanimously agreed the proposals and indicated it expected the new system to be up and running in hospitals by April 2016.  Presenting the review, Ian Dodge at NHS England, said it had been ""conclusive, open and transparent and rigorous"".  He said: ""Our analysis shows these proposals are affordable and deliverable, bearing in mind existing workforce constraints.  ""These are national standards and we expect national standards to continue to apply.""  At one time this unit was going to shut and it would have been the end of services in Leicester.  Now there is talk of it surviving but it will need collaboration between Glenfield and other units up and down the country.  The recommendations passed this morning mean they will have to go from two surgeons to four and they will have to build up their case load.  It won't be a walk in the park but the hospital says they think the service can survive.  Kate Shields from University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said the review would push them to provide excellent services for children and their families.  ""We have worked for a really long time to show that we can sustain heart services in Leicester and we are now at the point where we feel that we have been listened to,"" she said.  She added the trust was already working on the proposals submitted by NHS England.  The hospital wants to move all children's heart unit onto one site at the LRI in the next three years and increase the number of procedures it carries out within the next five years."
268,"Carlisle United have revealed plans to move from their Brunton Park home to a new stadium at Kingmoor in the north of the city.  The plans that would see a new 12,000 all-seater stadium built, ending a 102-year stay at their present home, were revealed to shareholders on Thursday.  Funding for the venue and surrounding buildings under the proposals would come from a development partner.  In addition, the new stadium would have office and training facilities.  A feasibility study found that the club's current site was a costly and unsuitable option for redevelopment.  Kingmoor Park was recommended by the study from 17 potential sites.  ""Everyone was very happy with the proposal,"" CUFC Online independent website editor Tim Graham told BBC Radio Cumbria, having attended the meeting.  ""From what the board were saying and the feasibity study, everyone in the meeting was for it.  ""Once everyone realises what's involved with it, I think a lot of people will be for it to be honest.""  The Cumbrians' existing ground meets the criteria set by the Football League to play in the bottom two tiers, but would not be suitable under regulations beyond that for the Championship.  ""Football League regulations, released in 2009, stipulated minimum ground standards which we are currently struggling to meet within Brunton Park,"" chairman John Nixon said within the statement.  ""The board would be doing a disservice to the fans if we didn't look into the future options for the club and report back to them for their input.""  Carlisle's next step is to present the findings and results of the study to supporters, which will take place on 24 November."
269,"Russia and the US reached an outline arms agreement in July The United States has rejected fresh concerns raised by Moscow about its planned missile defence system. The State Department statement came after Russian PM Vladimir Putin said the US plans were holding up a new nuclear disarmament treaty. The statement said the two issues were completely separate, and discussions would continue separately. Russia and the US are yet to find a successor to the Cold War-era Start I treaty, which expired on 5 December. Analysts say Moscow wants a clause in the new treaty that would limit the scale of any US defence shield. The US has shelved plans for missile defence stations in Central Europe, but intends to use a sea-based system. The BBC's Imtiaz Tyab in Washington says it is clear from Mr Putin's comments Russia still sees any missile shield as a threat - one it is now pledged to counter. But the hardening of Russia's position must be frustrating for US President Barack Obama, our correspondent says, after the concessions he has made. The US statement said that Washington and Moscow's joint position recognising the inter-relationship between defensive and offensive weapons systems had not changed. ""While the US has long agreed that there is a relationship between missile offence and defence, we believe the Start follow-on agreement is not the appropriate vehicle for addressing it,"" it said. Russia's government said until just a few days ago that these strategic arms reduction treaty talks were in their final stages, that they were perhaps just a couple of weeks away from signing a new document. And now suddenly Mr Putin has come out with this statement, which really does put a spanner in the works. It shows just how nervous Russia is about the idea of a US missile defence shield, despite the fact President Obama in September said they were going to scrap land-based missile defence in Europe. The US plans to build another system; the Russians don't know exactly how that's going to affect them and how it may neutralise their nuclear deterrent. I think Mr Putin is voicing a concern that is held by many experts in this country. ""We have agreed to continue to discuss the topic of missile defence with Russia in a separate venue."" Earlier Mr Putin said the US plans would allow them to do whatever they wanted and thus upset the balance. He said that ""to preserve the balance, we must develop offensive weapons systems"", but did not specify what kinds he had in mind. Earlier this month, President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would continue to develop new warheads, delivery vehicles and launchers despite the disarmament talks, describing this as ""routine practice"". Russia and the US are negotiating in Geneva on the details of a new treaty. Last week, the Russian foreign minister said a deal was very close. The 1991 Start I treaty led to deep cuts in nuclear arsenals by Washington and Moscow. Both sides have agreed to continue observing Start I until they reach a new agreement. Under a joint understanding signed in July, deployed nuclear warheads should be cut to fewer than 1,700 on each side within seven years of a new treaty - a huge cut on Soviet-era levels. Nonetheless, between them the two countries will retain enough firepower to destroy the world several times over. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Moscow says that Russia's nuclear arsenal is the only part of its military that remains world-class, and therefore it fears that it could be disadvantaged by cuts to nuclear capability. Mr Putin's comments could be a negotiating ploy, rather than a reversal of Russia's commitment to a treaty, our correspondent says. Analysts in Moscow think what Mr Putin really wants is a commitment from Washington to only deploy a small-scale missile defence system, that would be effective against Iran and North Korea but would not neutralise Russia's nuclear missile force, he adds.

270,"Cuban political prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo has died in hospital after 85 days on hunger strike.  Mr Zapata, 42, had been transferred to a Havana hospital from a smaller clinic in the central province of Camaguey after his condition worsened on Monday.  Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience after his arrest in March 2003 in a crackdown on opposition groups.  He had been refusing food in protest at jail conditions.  Mr Zapata, whose family announced last week that he was seriously ill, died on Tuesday in Havana's Hermanos Ameijeiras hospital.  His death marks the first time in nearly 40 years a Cuban activist starved himself to death to protest against government abuses.  The last political prisoner to die on hunger strike in Cuba was Pedro Luis Boitel, a poet and student leader, in 1972.  Mr Zapata's mother, Reina Luisa Tamayo, told the Miami newspaper El Nuevo Herald by telephone that her son had been ""murdered"" by Cuba's authorities.  ""They managed to do what they wanted,"" she said. ""They ended the life of a fighter for human rights.''  Laura Pollan, a dissident from the group known as Ladies in White, told the BBC: ""He wasn't a murderer. He wasn't a thief. He wasn't a rapist. He was simply a young man who wanted a better future for Cuba.""  Mr Zapata was among a group of some 75 dissidents jailed by the authorities in 2003. He was initially sentenced to three years in prison, but this was increased to 25 years in subsequent trials.  Cuba's illegal but tolerated Human Rights Commission says there are about 200 political prisoners still held in Cuba, about one-third less than when Raul Castro took over as president from his brother Fidel.  But if anything harassment of dissidents has increased over the past year, the group says.  Cuba designates prisoners of conscience as mercenaries sympathetic to the United States."
271,"Head of the Muslim Council of Britain Sir Iqbal Sacranie said introducing the partnerships did ""not augur well"" for building the foundations of society.  Nevertheless, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme, everyone should be tolerant.  Peter Tatchell of gay rights group OutRage! said: ""It is tragic for one minority to attack another minority.""  Sir Iqbal said of civil partnerships: ""This is harmful.  ""It does not augur well in building the very foundations of society - stability, family relationships. And it is something we would certainly not, in any form, encourage the community to be involved in.""  He said he was guided by the teachings of the Muslim faith, adding that other religions such as Christianity and Judaism held the same stance.  Asked if he believed homosexuality was harmful to society, he said: ""Certainly it is a practice that in terms of health, in terms of the moral issues that comes along in a society - it is. It is not acceptable.""  ""Each of our faiths tells us that it is harmful and I think, if you look into the scientific evidence that has been available in terms of the forms of various other illnesses and diseases that are there, surely it points out that where homosexuality is practised there is a greater concern in that area.""  He said everyone in society should be tolerant, and if they are not happy then engage in the democratic processes to give their views.  ""We may not be happy with the views being expressed by others. But the difficulty comes in that at the end of the day we are human beings.""  He said both the opponents and supporters of civil partnerships had the right to speak out.  Mr Tatchell, the founder of OutRage!, added: ""Both the Muslim and gay communities suffer prejudice and discrimination. We should stand together to fight Islamophobia and homophobia."""
272,"A bedrock programme in the UK comedy structure, Yes Minister embodied the early 1980s attitude to authority and politics as a gently hypocritical world filled with doubletalk.  The series follows Right Honorable James Hacker MP, Minister for Administrative Affairs, and his attempts to make officialdom and administration make sense. He does this whilst pushing his own self-serving agenda, and keeping his head above any nasty political waters. Throughout his career, he's up against Whitehall’s Sir Humphrey Appleby, unflappable symbol of a machine that has no gears, only brakes.  Jim's policies, whether cutting costs or trying to streamline red tape, are sabotaged by Appleby's Machiavellian skills, often accompanied by brain-wrenching sentences designed to confuse Hacker - and often succeeding. Absolutely snobbish and elitist, yet blind to anything that does not serve the Whitehall way, Sir Humphrey is the avatar of the British State.  Hacker's politics appear to be completely pragmatic and blown by the winds of chance, and are never dogmatic enough to be clearly labelled Labour or Conservative. By removing the trappings of a particular 'party' and allowing both sides to appear at their worst - venal and inconstant Hacker forever opposing the pompous and manipulative Appleby - Yes, Minister maintained a timeless quality that means it has endured beyond the Thatcherite politics it satirised.  Issues were raised that are still timely now - identity papers and computer databases of the population, university funding, arms sales, oil politics being just a few.  Motifs of the series included the wonderful music of Ronnie Hazelhurst playing against Gerald Scarfe's hilarious caricatures of the three leads; Hacker's use of catastrophically mixed metaphors, his Private Secretary Bernard's fondness for awful puns and maddening pedantry, and Sir Humphrey's laconic wit, almost shocking contempt for anyone who isn't a senior Civil Servant, and his catchphrase, usually after totally defeating Hacker, of muttering 'Yes Minster' to close the show.  Whilst the iconic figure of Sir Humphrey, as portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne, is the series' enduring legacy, the true star of the show is Hacker, as played by Paul Eddington. Though most of the verbal quips are Humphrey's, the comedy is Hacker's, mainly because Paul Eddington was probably the best comedy actor of his generation and his timing is miraculous.  Always buffeted by fate, wanting to do good but too scared of losing votes and status to do anything, Hacker is the symbol of all of us, wanting to be better, and not quite making it.  A true original, Yes Minister remains one of the most influential sitcoms of its time, as witness its huge success, many awards (including BAFTAs for the show and for Hawthorne).  Famously accurate in the spirit of the relationship between civil servant and politician, it was Mrs Thatcher's favourite show... make of that whatever you want. Yes Minister was proof that comedy could take on serious subjects and make real points with them."
273,"Despite the vote Denmark still holds the purse-strings Danish politicians say Greenland is still years away from true autonomy, despite its vote for greater self-rule. In a referendum on Tuesday, 75.5% of voters in Greenland backed a plan to increase their autonomy from Denmark, the former colonial power. Denmark subsidises Greenland's 57,000 population to the tune of 3.2bn kroner (£395m) annually - two-thirds of the Arctic island's budget revenue. Greenland's foreign policy and security will remain in Danish hands. ""Whether the Greenlanders can take over more political institutions themselves depends heavily on the natural resources. It could well be 30-40 years,"" said Per Oerum Joergensen, an MP in Denmark's governing Conservative Party. He helped negotiate the new Greenland autonomy deal. Greenland's tiny population, combined with its economic dependence on Denmark, weakens the case for independence, even if Greenland strikes oil, a senior Danish Arctic affairs official told the BBC. ""The population is less than you could fit into the Superbowl,"" Mikaela Engell of the Danish foreign ministry said. The self-rule plan is expected to be approved by the Danish parliament early next year and should go into effect on 21 June 2009. Under the new arrangement, Greenlanders - most of whom are native Inuit - will have control of their energy resources and will be treated as a separate people under international law. Kalaallisut will become the official language, instead of Danish. But Denmark's 3.2bn-kroner annual grant to Greenland will be fixed. If Greenland strikes oil then it will keep up to 75m kroner of revenue from the oil sales, but above that half will go to Greenland and half will be taken out of the Danish block grant. If the revenue reduces the grant to zero, then the whole subsidy deal will be renegotiated, Ms Engell said. Danish MP Soeren Espersen, a member of the Danish People's Party, was sceptical about the new autonomy deal, saying Greenlanders had been ""brainwashed with unprecedented propaganda"". ""I believe huge problems are waiting in the future,"" he said. Greenland gained self-rule in 1979, after previously being a colony and then a province of Denmark. Greenland has been shaken by several scandals over abuse of public money and property in recent years. Danish police are currently investigating how 11 Greenland MPs and top officials managed to buy attractive properties at a third of the market price. The scandals have led some Danes to call for stronger controls over Greenland's management of the Danish subsidies. Meanwhile, global warming is fuelling a new Arctic race for resources, as geologists get ice-free access to the vast area, raising the potential for a future energy bonanza. But earlier this year, the US Geological Survey (USGS) more than halved its estimate of the potential oil and gas riches off the coast of Greenland. In 2000, the USGS estimate was 40bn barrels of oil. In 2008, that was cut to 10-20bn barrels. Experts agree that it could well be 15-20 years before the oil is found - and even longer before the huge investments required pay dividends. The European Commission says it is now time for EU countries to coordinate their Arctic policies, not least because it wants development of the region's huge resources to be sustainable and environmentally responsible. Denmark, Sweden and Finland all control parts of the Arctic region. Greenland is associated with the EU, but is not an EU member under its conditions of autonomy. Ms Engell said Denmark welcomed more EU involvement in the Arctic, having ""tried to direct the EU's interest"" towards the region."
274,"The 1984 killing of thousands of ethnic Somalis in Kenya is to be investigated, Prime Minister Raila Odinga says.  Mr Odinga said the attorney general should ensure those responsible for the killings are brought to justice.  Witnesses say some 5,000 men were taken to an airstrip and denied food and water for five days before being shot by the army, which had been sent to the area to stop clan violence.  The government has previously said it could only confirm 365 deaths.  ""We are yet to fully understand what exactly happened at Wagalla airstrip where thousands of people were killed,"" Mr Odinga said in the town of Wajir at a ceremony to mark the 27th anniversary of the killings.  ""We are yet to know who gave the orders to the soldiers and who made the decision.""  He also ordered a museum to be built to honour those who were killed in the area which is primarily inhabited by ethnic Somalis.  It was the worst human rights violation in Kenya's history, according to Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission head Ron Slye.  The commission was established following a 2008 peace agreement to end post-election violence to look into present and past atrocities committed in the country.  Last year, a new constitution was implemented, intended to end years of human rights abuses."
275,"Malta has voted ""Yes"" in a non-binding referendum on legalising divorce, Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi has conceded, local media report.  Almost three-quarters of the electorate voted on Saturday on whether divorce should be introduced in Malta.  A majority Catholic country, Malta is the only EU country not to allow divorce.  Figures from the electoral commission late on Saturday showed turnout was 72%, the Times of Malta reports.  ""Even though the result is not what I wished for, now it is our duty to see that the will of the majority is respected,"" Dr Gonzi said in a televised speech.  Dr Gonzi, who campaigned against the introduction of divorce, has said it is now up the parliament to enact a law legalising the dissolution of marriage on the island.  The Catholic Church, which is very influential in the archipelago, had also supported a ""No"" vote during the campaign.  The leader of the ""Yes"" movement, Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, of the governing Nationalist Party, said the result was significant.  ""It brings Malta into a new era where the state and the Church are separate,"" Mr Orlando is quoted as saying by Efe news agency.  Malta is one of only two countries in the world (with the Philippines) to ban divorce - apart from the Vatican.  Chile was the last country to legalise divorce in 2004 after overwhelming public pressure.  Maltese voters were asked whether parliament should introduce a new law that would allow couples to obtain a divorce after four years of separation.  Previously, couples could apply for a legal separation through the courts, or seek a Church annulment - a complex process that can take up to nine years.  A third option was to get divorced abroad - and that would then be valid in Malta."

This has made it a target for intervention by the US, which in 1989 invaded Panama to depose a former ally, Manuel Noriega, and until 1999 controlled the Panama Canal. Panama has the largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere outside the Amazon Basin and its jungle is home to an abundance of tropical plants, animals and birds - some of them to be found nowhere else in the world.

The result appeared to run counter a wider Latin American trend towards the left. With Panama's recent rapid rate of economic growth slowing as a result of the global economic slump, Mr Martinelli's business background attracted many voters fearful about job losses. The previous government was blamed for rising crime and a surge in prices, and Mr Martinelli tapped into feelings that little had been done to spread the wealth created in the economic boom to low-income Panamanians. During the campaign, he promised to promote free trade, especially with the US, Panama's biggest trading partner, and to encourage foreign investment.

278,"Continental heavyweights Nigeria and South Africa have both condemned the constitutional changes which saw Faure Gnassingbe inherit the presidency following his father's death.  Both the African Union and the West African regional body, Ecowas, are threatening to impose sanctions - which would be an unprecedented step on a continent where leaders generally feel strong solidarity.  The European Union (EU), the United States and France, which was close to the former regime of Eyadema Gnassingbe, have all backed Africa's strong stance.  President Olusegun Obasanjo said: ""All African leaders should not accept what has happened in that country until there is a democratic transition.""  And after what seems to be a mix-up over a plane carrying some of Mr Obasanjo's officials, he has said he will recall his ambassador to Togo.  Mr Obasanjo is one of the prime movers behind the latest African development plan, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad).  This is based on Africa improving its governance, in return for more western aid and better terms of trade.  If Africa cannot ensure that rules are respected in poor and tiny Togo, cynics will say there is little hope for the rest of the continent.  And if donors take that view, the prospect of large dollops of aid and debt relief will vanish over the horizon.  However, Togo remains unbowed and it remains to be seen what Africa's leaders can do to ensure that presidential elections are held, as they insist.  There has been much talk of sanctions but no details on whether these would stop trade to Togo or be targeted at Mr Faure and his associates.  Togo shares the CFA currency with several neighbours and has signed a regional agreement guaranteeing the free circulation of people and goods, making trade sanctions hard to enforce.  Togo's political elite has already proved adept at deflecting criticism.  In the wake of international demands to respect the constitution, parliament called an emergency session to amend it.  Parliamentary speaker Fambare Natchaba Ouattara had been next in line but the army and the ruling party did not want him to take over, so they closed the borders while he was abroad and replaced him with Mr Faure.  The constitution also stated that elections should be held within two months of a president's death, so parliament, dominated by the ruling Togo People's Rally (RPT) voted to delete that article and allow Mr Faure to inherit his father's term of office, which runs until 2008.  Communications Minister Pitang Tchalla strongly denies this amounts to a military coup, as some have charged.  ""How long do you expect us to wait when there is a power vacuum at the summit of the state?"" he asked.  One European diplomat seemed to imply that this neat trick might be accepted. ""It is a political manoeuvre that has not violated the constitution. One might feel manipulated but it is in within the lines of the constitution,"" he told Reuters news agency.  If criticism remains strong, Mr Faure and his allies could take the next step to legitimise his grip on power and hold elections - as several African coup-makers have done.  Shortly after parliament voted to change the constitution, Mr Faure hinted that elections could be held soon:  But such promises do not wash with the opposition, who say that previous polls were rigged.  Veteran opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio agrees that the original 60-day timeframe was too short for ""free and fair"" elections.  In 1993, huge demonstrations were held following what the opposition felt were rigged elections.  Amnesty International says that hundreds died when the army put down the protests.  Patrick Smith, editor of the journal Africa Confidential, says that the army, which has been key in the move to install Mr Faure, would take similar action now.  ""If they do go on the streets, one can expect a pretty robust show of force from Togo's army,"" he told the BBC's Network Africa programme.  Any potential demonstrators may be too afraid to cause much trouble.  The army has been transformed from a rag-tag bunch when Mr Eyadema came to power to a well-organised, well-equipped modern fighting force, and it remains fiercely loyal to him - and now his son, says the BBC's Ebow Godwin in Lome.  While Togo could be a test case for Africa, France may play a key role in Togo's immediate future, as it possesses the carrot of aid, as well as the possible stick of the soldiers it has based in Togo. Its troops have already been put on alert.  But some believe that France's position is not entirely clear.  Patrick Smith says that France and the Eyadema regime had close financial ties and so France is unlikely to insist on elections.  French President Jacques Chirac mourned as ""a personal friend"" Eyadema, who ruled with an iron fist to earn the title of Africa's longest-serving leader.  But Mr Chirac also urged ""Togolese political forces to maintain strict respect for the constitution"".  However, Togo's leaders would now say they have strictly respected the law.  The EU cut off aid to Togo in the aftermath of the 1993 elections but before Eyadema's death, negotiations were underway to resume aid if electoral reforms were implemented.  The prospect of restoring aid gives the EU considerable leverage over Togo and in relatively obscure, French-speaking African countries, such as Togo, France's voice often dominates EU policy.  If France does back up Africa's tough words, Togo may indeed have little choice but to undo its constitutional changes and hold presidential elections.  But if France does indeed remain loyal to the son of its ""friend"", that would certainly make Mr Faure feel he could ignore the criticism of his neighbours.  Or at the very least, ensure that the outcome of any elections was never in doubt, which would hardly be a novelty in the region."
279,"A new £89m technology centre is set to open in Scotland by 2014 after securing its final piece of funding.  The centre, at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, has been awarded £6.7m in European funding.  The facility will bring together academics and industry to work on new technologies in areas such as energy, engineering and pharmaceuticals.  Scottish government agencies are contributing £26m to the scheme, with the university supplying £57m.  The £6.7m funding is coming through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  Strathclyde University's principal, Professor Jim McDonald, said: ""With our partners in business and industry, we are seeking breakthroughs to deal with energy demands, climate change, global health challenges, a testing economic climate and the need for more energy efficient, more advanced technology.  ""The competitive advantage the centre will deliver, the inward investment it will attract and the valuable training the building project will offer apprentices will complement the economic benefits of Glasgow's Commonwealth Games in 2014.""  Infrastructure Secretary Alex Neil added: ""It is a substantial boost for our renewables industry that we have secured the final £6.7m that will enable this world class project to go ahead.  ""I am sure this project can prove a real boost for our economy, securing massive research investment and hundreds of new jobs."""
280,"It's the obvious question to ask former KLF pop star Bill Drummond but almost a decade on, he still doesn't have an easy answer.  A trained visual artist, Drummond, 51, forged a reputation built on a series of art pranks which shocked and delighted in equal measures.  What about dumping dead sheep at the Brit Awards, giving £40,000 for the worst art in Britain to Rachel Whiteread on the same night she won the £20,000 Turner prize and, most infamously, burning £1m of the proceeds of pop fame on a remote Scottish island.  Drummond's latest project may be less dramatic, but it is equally eccentric - on every night of Belfast's Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival in May, he will go to someone's house and make soup for their family and friends.  He remains unclear whether this has any artistic significance, but says he hopes to find out in the future ""or perhaps somebody will tell me"".  ""In 1998, I was asked to come over to Belfast to take part in an exhibition at a house up Botanic Avenue,"" he said.  ""I decided not to put an exhibit in, but make soup for everyone in the house, as a kind of event and it went really well.""  He says he has always enjoyed making soup, and took the idea a step further when a listings magazine in Nottingham asked him to provide a competition prize, ""expecting a signed book or something"".  ""I decided that the prize should be me coming around to the winner's house to make soup for their friends and family,"" he said.  ""It went really well, just the idea of turning up with my ingredients and pots and pans.  ""I drove home that night, and in the larder door in the kitchen, I've got a map of the British Isles.  ""I drew a line across the map through Belfast and Nottingham, and decided it should be the Soup Line. If anybody living on the line contacted me, I would come to their place and make them soup.""  Drummond says he is fascinated by maps, especially borders between relatively newer countries which effectively are straight lines, like the one dividing the US and Canada.  He has been a regular visitor to Northern Ireland ever since he was a child growing up in Scotland.  ""I come from near Stranraer in Galloway, and as a child, it was easier to come across to Belfast than go to Glasgow or Edinburgh for things like Christmas shopping - it was the nearest big city.""  Drummond also owns property in the province - not your average ex-pop star's mock Tudor mansion but a fortified tower built in the 19th century, complete with a dungeon.  ""It evolved into becoming an artists' residency, where they can get on with work there for two to four weeks at a time,"" he said.  In August 1994, the pair travelled to a boathouse in the Scottish island of Jura with £1m of money earned by KLF hits such as Justified and Ancient, 3AM Eternal and What Time is Love?  They lit a bonfire and burned the £50 notes, recording it for a film called Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid.  ""Of course I regret it - who wouldn't!"" Drummond now says.  ""My children especially regret it, but I don't regret it all the time.  ""I remember once, one of my children came home from school and said 'somebody told me in the playground that you once burned a hundred quid - is it true?'  ""I said, 'I wish that was true!'""  As with the Soup Line, Drummond says he is still waiting to be told the artistic significance of burning the money.  ""A long time ago, we realised that everybody wanted us to have the smart answer, and we felt we owed it to people, especially our families, to have this.  ""It was more for other people to take from it whatever they wanted, whether it be 'they obviously didn't do it' or 'it's a terrible thing' or whatever. It's for other people to explore.""  Having written a book with Cauty called The Manual: How to Have A Number One The Easy Way, you might think that all he had to do to make the money back was release another single and have another hit.  The 1988 book came with a guarantee that if wannabes who followed their instructions to the letter failed to have a number one hit within three months, they would refund the price of the book.  Austrian duo Edelweiss did just that and sold two million copies of a single called Bring Me Edelweiss.  However, Drummond feels he would not be able to hit the top of the charts in 2004, partly because of his age.  ""I know when I stopped doing pop music, if that's what it was, I made the decision to stop at a point when we were at a reasonable height and hadn't outstayed our welcome.  ""Even if I followed The Manual to the word, it would be a disaster and an embarrassment,"" he said.  Despite his retirement from the music business, projects like the Soup Line are proof that Drummond has not lost the ability to surprise and confound people's expectations.  The Soup Line is part of the Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival. Running throughout Belfast until 9 May, it features a varied programme of events in music, comedy, theatre, literature, film, circus, street theatre and visual art."
281,"The head of the BBC's Westminster political programmes team has been named as Prime Minister Theresa May's new director of communications.  Robbie Gibb, who edits the Daily Politics, replaces Katie Perrior, who quit before the general election.  He worked for the Conservative MP Francis Maude in the 1990s, as well as Michael Portillo.  He tweeted it had been ""a privilege to work for the BBC "" and he would ""always be a supporter"" of the corporation.  Mr Gibb has edited several BBC political programmes during a long career at the Corporation, including the Daily Politics, This Week and the Andrew Marr Show, and is a former deputy editor of Newsnight.  The BBC's director of news, James Harding, said he had been ""an innovator in story-telling on television and an unrelenting advocate of the BBC, its independence and our public service role"".  ""The signal quality he and his programmes have shown is the willingness to speak truth to power - I suspect it will come in handy,"" he added.  Following reports that he had been interviewed for the job, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale tweeted that he had been asked to consider it but decided not to apply.  Ms Perrior, a former PR executive, resigned as Mrs May's director of communications when the PM called a snap general election in April. She went on to criticise Mrs May's closest advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who were forced to stand down when the PM lost her majority.  Her predecessor in the Downing Street communications role, Sir Craig Oliver, was also poached from the BBC, where he was editor of the Ten O'Clock News.  Mr Gibb's brother is the Conservative MP and schools minister Nick Gibb.  The position of Downing Street director of communications, which was first held by Alastair Campbell under Labour PM Tony Blair, has normally been held by a former newspaper or TV journalist."
282,"Partick Thistle are to receive £4m funding for their first-ever dedicated training ground and believe it will help them compete for future honours.  The Glasgow club secured a top-six finish in the Scottish Premiership with Saturday's 1-0 win over Motherwell.  Now they have announced funding for the new facility from the Weir family who won £160m on the lottery in 2011.  Partick Thistle managing director Ian Maxwell agreed it could help keep the Jags at the top end of the table.  ""I think it gives us that opportunity,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""It is transformational. This is the missing link we've had for a while.  ""It is an amazing thing to be able to announce and I don't think the club will truly understand the difference it is going to make until we are 10-15 years down the line and we can see the benefits.""  No site has yet been earmarked for the project, but the Three Black Cats, a company set up by Colin and Christine Weir to provide long-term investment, hopes to have it up-and-running within two years.  ""It will be Glasgow or the Greater Glasgow area,"" said Maxwell, who pointed out that city rivals Celtic and Rangers both already have out-of-town facilities.  ""It doesn't necessarily have to be Maryhill or anywhere near the stadium.""  Thistle's various squads presently use different training facilities at locations spread around Glasgow, with Maxwell pointing out that the academy's six teams alone use ""half a dozen sites on any night of the week"".  Now the Three Black Cats will work with the Maryhill-based club to design and build the new training ground to Thistle's specification.  It will then be leased to the football club on a long-term basis and Maxwell paid tribute to the Weir family for their latest gesture.  ""They have been absolutely incredible,"" he said. ""They've been great for the club over a number of seasons.  ""They have helped with the academy and this is the next step. This is a real legacy statement.""  Thistle chairman David Beattie said it had been ""a long-term ambition of the club"" to house their first-team, youth and women's teams in one facility.  ""The money we currently spend on facilities around Glasgow will be used to service our lease and costs at the new ground,"" he said.  ""It reinforces that we are an established Premiership club, with a level of professionalism and ambition that these new facilities will reflect.""  A Three Black Cats spokesman said they had been looking for a new long-term investment opportunity.  ""Thistle's ongoing stability - through the club management's financial prudence and through the board's strong leadership - persuaded us that this development is a worthwhile investment, "" he said.  ""It will be an exciting project and we are keen to get on with securing land as soon as possible.  ""It is our intention to have the facility completed and operational within two years and will work closely with Thistle to ensure that it is fit for purpose.""  Thistle Weir Youth Academy director Gerry Britton hopes it will help the club fill their first-team with home-grown players and become one of the best places in the country to produce new talent.  ""I really still can't believe it,"" he said. ""It is always something we had dreamt of - to have our new facility - and it's fantastic news.  ""It might double the amount of contact time we have with each player and it will enhance their development and ability to reach their potential."""
283,"The parents of the babies knew what he was doing, and that it would relieve their suffering - but could also hasten their deaths.  Dr Munro said after a hearing that he hoped the decision would mean more discussion on end of life decisions.  The General Medical Council (GMC) hearing ruled the doctor's fitness to practise was not impaired by his actions.  The hearing had earlier heard the actions in 2005 were ""tantamount to euthanasia"".  Dr Munro said after the hearing: ""I very much regret any distress that has been caused to the parents of both babies by these proceedings before the General Medical Council.  ""I hope that today's decision will promote further consideration of the treatment of neonates and end of life decision making and that this, in turn, will lead to clearer professional guidance for doctors, better patient care and greater support for parents.  ""Obviously, I am very relieved by the outcome of the fitness to practise panel hearing and I would like to thank everybody who has supported me over the last few months.""  The GMC said he intended to relieve suffering rather than hasten their deaths.  The consultant neonatologist gave 23 times the normal dose of a paralysing muscle relaxant in the final moments before one baby's death.  During a subsequent inquiry Dr Munro denied he had previously used the drug in similar circumstances, but it later emerged he had given it to another terminally ill baby during its final moments six months earlier.  The GMC panel, which was sitting in Manchester, concluded this was misleading but was not dishonest.  The panel also rejected claims that his actions were inappropriate and fell below standard, as there were no clear specific professional guidelines.  They rejected that in administering the paralysing agent to the children Dr Munro had fallen below the standard expected of a registered medical practitioner.  Both children suffered violent body spasms in the final moments of their lives - a condition known as agonal gasping.  Dr Roelf Dijkhuizen, medical director NHS Grampian, said: ""These incidents have been very distressing for all concerned, but most especially for the families of the two babies. We extend our sympathies to them.  ""The treatment given to both babies was not part of accepted practice and therefore following a thorough investigation the decision was taken to refer Dr Munro to the GMC.  ""We note the findings of the panel and agree with their view that Dr Munro's actions were taken with the best interests of the babies and their families in mind.""  He said that since the incidents came to light, a protocol for all ""end of life"" decisions has been put in place to comply with guidelines.  Dr Dijkhuizen said: ""We believe these measures will avoid similar incidents arising in future.  ""Patients and families can be reassured that NHS Grampian remains absolutely confident that the quality of care in the neonatal unit is of the highest standard.""

285,"Stephen Byers, interviewed on BBC Radio Five about government plans to improve numeracy in schools, was asked to multiply eight by seven.  ""Fifty-four,"" said the minister, whose job is to raise standards in the classroom for reading, writing and arithmetic.  But a spokesman for the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said he still had full confidence in Byers, a junior minister regarded as one of the Government's rising stars.  ""The Prime Minister and those responsible for government communications applaud anything which gets up in lights the issues we are seeking to promote,"" the spokesman said.  ""It is one of those character-forming events,"" he added.  Mr Byers's boss, Education Secretary David Blunkett, was also almost caught out when asked in the middle of a briefing about the government's numeracy strategy.  He was asked to multiply nine by eight.  Mr Blunkett gave the correct answer, 72, but only after appearing to begin to give an answer beginning with six.  He joked: ""Part of the joy of teaching was sometimes being able to reinforce your learning as you taught others.""  ""It's a long time since I've done my eight times-table. You have helped me refresh my rustiness.  The Byers gaffe was reminiscent of former American Vice-President Dan Quayle's attempt to improve the spelling of ""potato"" by adding an extra ""e"".

286,"He told the High Court his evidence to a Commons sub-committee was not accurate. He apologised but said he had not been trying to conceal any plot.  Mr Byer's words came on the last day in the case of Railtrack shareholders who are claiming compensation.  About 50,000 shareholders claim the government deliberately allowed the rail infrastructure firm to fail in October 2001, and are demanding £157m in compensation.  When Mr Byers was questioned by a Commons sub-committee, he said he was not aware of a change in Railtrack's status being discussed before 25 July 2001.  But in the court on Thursday he was challenged over this version of events by the shareholders' barrister - who produced documentary evidence showing the work had started.  They included e-mails and notes from Department of Transport officials showing that taking Railtrack into administration had been one of the options being discussed as early as June.  Quizzed by Keith Rowley, QC for Railtrack shareholders, Mr Byers admitted his answer to MPs had been untrue.  ""It is true to say there was work going on, so, yes, that was untrue,"" he said.  Questioning Mr Byers again about the ""welter of documentation"" on the options for Railtrack, Mr Rowley, QC said: ""You could not possibly have believed that the answer you gave ... was true, could you?""  ""I accept this is not an accurate statement,"" said Mr Byers.  He was asked if it was ""deliberately not an accurate statement"".  Mr Byers replied: ""It was such a long time ago, I cannot remember, but it is not a truthful statement and I apologise for that.  ""I cannot remember the motives behind it.""  The MP later told the court he had been under pressure during the hearing and had not set out to conceal any conspiracy or plot.  Responding to Mr Byers' admission, shadow transport secretary Alan Duncan said whatever the verdict in court, the government ""will still have to face the verdict of parliament"".  ""I make no judgement about the court case but it seems from all the evidence that is emerging that this is a growing scandal of government from which Stephen Byers and Gordon Brown have no escape.  ""If, as it seems today, Stephen Byers lied to a parliamentary committee, not only is that a disgrace in itself but it shows that their plans for Railtrack were deeply devious and could be a scandal of enormous proportions.  ""Whatever happens in court this issue is not going to go away.""  Mr Byers resigned as transport secretary in May 2002.  At the time, he said he had tried to ""behave honourably"", adding ""the people that know me best know I am not a liar"".  Mr Byers has told the High Court the Treasury had concerns about ending Railtrack and removing the role of shareholders.  He said Chancellor Gordon Brown had a list of 10 conditions to be met before he would agree to Railtrack being changed to a non-shareholder company.  The list was internally nicknamed ""The 10 Commandments"", he said.  At a meeting on 19 September 2001 - three weeks before Railtrack went into administration - Tony Blair told Mr Byers he had to talk to the chancellor if he wanted more money to fund the company.  But the court heard it was left to Mr Byers to decide whether to take the company into administration if he decided to refuse Railtrack's request for more money - subject to the Treasury conditions.  Mr Byers said he had worked with his officials to see if the conditions could be met.  On Thursday, the shareholders QC, Keith Rowley, about when he made up his mind.  ""I suggest there was a clear strategy, developed by you and your officials, accepting that Railtrack would not immediately collapse but might fall over in a year or two, to force Railtrack into administration by ensuring you held all the cards and all other options were closed off,"" said Mr Rowley.  But Mr Byers replied that his discussions with officials were ""sensible contingency planning"" in case it was decided to refuse to give the company more funds.  There is one more witness to be heard in the court case and lawyers for both sides will spend most of next week delivering their closing speeches.  The judgement in the case is not expected to be delivered until after the court's summer break."

He was accused of inciting the deaths in his writings for the cult.  His lawyer had argued that the drafts were ""esoteric ramblings"" that could not have inspired violence.  The court in the French city of Grenoble upheld a lower court ruling from 2001 that has also acquitted Mr Tabachnik.  The cult members died apparently believing they would find a better world on another planet.  Their bodies were found in woodland clearings in Switzerland, Canada and France."
288,"MPs have overwhelmingly backed plans to introduce an overall cap on the amount the UK spends on welfare each year.  Welfare spending, excluding the state pension and some unemployment benefits, will be capped next year at £119.5bn.  The idea, put forward by Chancellor George Osborne in last week's Budget, would in future see limits set at the beginning of each Parliament.  With Labour supporting the idea, the measure was approved in the House of Commons by 520 to 22 votes.  However, eleven Labour backbenchers defied their leadership by voting against the plan.  The rebels included former shadow ministers Diane Abbott and Tom Watson.  The cap will include spending on the vast majority of benefits, including pension credits, severe disablement allowance, incapacity benefits, child benefit, both maternity and paternity pay, universal credit and housing benefit.  However, Jobseeker's allowance and the state pension will be excluded.  Under the proposed system, if a government wanted to spend more on one area of the welfare state it would have to compensate by making cuts elsewhere, to stay within the overall cap.  If the limit is breached - or going to be breached - ministers would have to explain why to Parliament and get the approval of MPs in a vote.  Mr Osborne told Parliament that welfare could be ""both fair and affordable"".  ""Some of these benefits help some of the most vulnerable citizens, like Disability Living Allowance, but that is not an excuse for the failure to manage its budget,"" he said.  Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC that the cap would stop politicians in the future from saying welfare spending ""was under control when it was rising"".  Labour has said it would introduce a three-year cap on structural spending, covering all the benefits included in the government's proposal.  But Mr Duncan Smith said Labour needed to explain how it would pay for its £460m pledge to reverse changes to cuts to housing benefit for additional rooms in council and social housing.  The shadow work and pensions secretary, Rachel Reeves, said Labour had plans in place to pay for its pledge to reverse what it calls the ""bedroom tax"" - the housing benefit changes that ministers say ended the ""spare room subsidy"".  Asked whether Labour was prepared to cut aspects of the welfare bill to stay within the cap, she said she was ""confident"" it would not need to because it would tackle the ""root causes"" of rising costs - such as low wages, youth unemployment and the increase in part-time workers.  ""We would do it in different ways to the way the government is proposing to do it but we are confident that our way will control the cost of social security.""  Diane Abbott, one of the Labour rebels, said the cap was a blunt mechanism that would not take into account changes in people's circumstances and economic factors such as rising rents.  ""Social security, people's lives, should not be made a matter of short-term political positioning,"" she said.  But Conservative MP Ben Gummer said it was ""astounding"" more was being spent on benefits, tax credits and state pensions than other departmental budgets put together.  He said the cap would force governments to address the underlying causes of welfare dependency rather than just ""jacking up the bill every time they are faced with a difficult problem"".  Lib Dem MP John Hemming said the welfare state should provide a ""solid safety net"" but it was ""nonsense"" to suggest that total costs should not be managed.  BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the proposed government cap for next year was, in broad terms, what the UK was already spending on those benefits and would rise in line with inflation in following years."
289,"Corrective baby helmets have virtually no effect on head shape, according to the most definitive study yet.  The use of rigid plastic helmets has become popular with parents concerned their baby has an odd-shaped head.  But research, in the British Medical Journal, suggests they are little better than doing nothing, and can cause side-effects such as rashes.  Strategies such as placing babies on their stomachs during waking hours should be explored, say researchers.  Most babies go to sleep laid on their backs to reduce the risk of sudden infant death.  Because of this, mild skull deformities - where babies' skulls are slightly flattened on one side or at the back of the head - are becoming more common.  Except in rare cases, this is generally considered a cosmetic condition.  But some parents seek treatment from a paediatrician, which involves babies wearing a £2,000 helmet for 23 hours a day from six months old until they turn one.  Past studies have produced conflicting results over the success of the therapy.  In the latest research, scientists in the Netherlands followed 84 healthy full-term babies.  Half of the babies wore a custom-made helmet between the age of six months and one year, while the other half had no treatment.  When checked at the age of two years, there was no significant difference between the two groups, with only about a quarter in each group making a full recovery - 26% who had treatment, 23% who had no treatment.  All parents of the babies who had worn helmets reported downsides, including:  However, there was no evidence that helmet therapy influenced the infants' development or quality of life.  Lead researcher Renske van Wijk, of the University of Twente, said they would generally discourage parents from using the helmets.  ""The helmets have no added value compared to doing nothing and a helmet is an expensive treatment,"" she told BBC News.  ""All parents in the study reported one or more side-effects in the group where infants wore helmets.  ""We would discourage helmet therapy in healthy infants, but parents with concerns should always speak to a doctor.""  She added that babies with very severe skull flattening were not studied.  Prof Brent Collett, of the Seattle Children's Research Institute, said the study was important because it was the first randomised controlled trial of helmet therapy.  ""Kids do not appear to grow out of asymmetric head shape, but we don't know what the significance of that is yet,"" he told BBC News.  ""At least in this study, treatment did not appear to make a significant difference.""  He said new strategies were needed, such as encouraging the use of ""tummy time"" - placing babies on their stomachs during waking hours.  Experts say it is vital for parents to continue laying babies on their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of sudden infant death.  Dr Simon Newell, a consultant neonatologist and vice-president at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in London, said: ""Parents should be reassured that they are doing the right thing to nurse their baby on her/his back when put to sleep.  ""If this results in a change in head shape, they should rest assured that their child will not come to any long-term harm."""
290,"Council chiefs hope Mick and Keith could return to the resort More than four decades after their gig at the Empress Ballroom finished in a riot, The Rolling Stones are finally being allowed back into Blackpool. The former hell raisers were given an indefinite ban from the resort in 1964 after fans stormed the stage. More than 50 people were taken to hospital after fans ripped up seats, threw bottles and smashed a piano. But now council chiefs are writing to the Stones saying it is all over now - and have invited them back. The band were bundled off stage as the ballroom erupted in violence, believed to have started after a member of the 7,000-strong crowd spat at guitarist Brian Jones. Historian Terry Regan, who was in the audience, said: ""Although I was a young bloke at the time I was quite scared. Fans were determined to touch the band, a witness says ""There was a mass rush for the stage. ""There was a group of people, probably two or three hundred, determined to lay hands on the Rolling Stones."" The Stones tried to return to the resort a year after the incident to play at a different venue. But the police watch committee refused them a licence, saying there would be too much trouble - a ban which has effectively kept the band out of the resort ever since. However, it's a situation that current council leader Peter Callow would like to see remedied to bring some glamour back to the resort. ""I've given instruction to our council officers to write to The Rolling Stones to say: 'Right, the ban is lifted. We reach out the hand of friendship.' ""What I am saying is: 'Come back Mick, all is forgiven.'"" The Rolling Stones have not commented on the lifting of the ban.     "
291,"Blackpool Panthers will not take part in Championship One next season after having their membership of the Rugby Football League cancelled. The club, who went into administration in October, missed Thursday's deadline to present plans for their involvement. Panthers enjoyed their best-ever season in 2010, as they reached the end-of-season play-offs. But their off-field problems worsened after head coach Martin Crompton decided to step down. The club held crisis talks with potential investors at the beginning of November in an attempt to stave off the threat of liquidation. Speaking before that meeting, vice-chairman John Chadwick told BBC Radio Lancashire that he was fearing the worst. With plans for the 2011 season at an advanced stage we have had no choice but to regretfully decide to cancel their membership    ""The club ceased trading a number of weeks ago and accountants and insolvency experts have been spoken to,"" he said.

In an official statement, RFL chief operating officer Ralph Rimmer said: ""The RFL has done everything possible to ensure the continuing involvement of Blackpool Panthers in Co-operative Championship One and we had every hope that a credible plan would be presented. ""Despite a flexible approach to deadlines and ongoing support from the RFL, as well as a commitment from the club's representatives right up to the last minute that a plan would be forthcoming, we have received notification that no proposal will be presented.

292,"The family of a nurse stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend have protested outside court demanding to know why he was ""freed to kill"".  Ex-ambulance worker Jonathan Vass, 30, was jailed for life on Thursday for murdering Jane Clough, 26, outside Blackpool Victoria Hospital on 25 July.  Preston Crown Court heard Vass, who must serve at least 30 years, killed while on bail awaiting a rape trial.  The Office for Judicial Communications said the judge acted within the law.  Her parents and 20 supporters stood on the court steps with banners.  John and Penny Clough wore ""Justice for Jane"" T-shirts and badges, emblazoned with a smiling photo of their loved one, and holding aloft home-made banners.  One had a photo of Vass with the words: ""I was freed on bail by Judge Simon Newell,"" followed by a photo of Ms Clough with the words: ""And killed.""  Another banner read: ""Reported rapes got no justice.""  Ms Clough's family said she was doubly failed, first by Vass having been given bail and secondly by him not facing trial for rape.  A further banner referred to Judge Russell's comments at an earlier hearing where he said the rape charge ""pales into insignificance"" compared to the murder - ""the most serious crime in the criminal calendar"".  A banner read: ""Insignificant rapes? I could turn in my grave.""  Ms Clough first called police on November 29 2009 with Vass arrested the same day and locked up.  Charged with nine counts of rape, one of sexual assault and three counts of common assault he was remanded in custody at his first court appearance.  But 12 days after he was held, the 17-stone bouncer and bodybuilder appeared at Burnley Crown Court where his defence applied for bail.  Judge Newell, who was appointed to the Northern Circuit in July 2008 on the recommendation of then Lord Chancellor Jack Straw, decided to grant him bail and Vass was given his freedom to await trail for rape on condition he lived in Preston, did not contact Ms Clough and did not enter Burnley or Pendle  He broke all conditions and also tracked Ms Clough on the social media website Facebook.  Her family today packed the public gallery to hear Judge Russell pass sentence.  He made no comment on his fellow judge's decision to grant bail, but explained to the family why he decided Vass should not be prosecuted for rape.  The judge said that legally, ordering the charges to ""lie on file"" was not the same as ""dropping the charges"" although they amount to the same thing for the prospect of any prosecution.  Judge Russell added the fact of the rape allegations did not cast any doubt on Ms Clough's integrity in making them and he would take them into account when passing sentence.  ""I know that this decision has resulted in distress and anguish,"" he explained.  ""But I am satisfied that it was the correct decision in the overall public interest, which requires consideration of many factors, otherwise I would not have authorised it.""  An attempt to contact Judge Newell has been made through the the Office for Judicial Communications but no comment has yet been made.  The Office for Judicial Communications said the judge in the rape case decided on bail ""within the statutory framework provided by Parliament in the Bail Act 1976 (as amended)."""
293,"The soldiers pillaged the library after capturing the Peruvian capital, Lima, in 1881, during the War of the Pacific.  Exactly 3,778 books were returned to Peru's national library - and there was no talk of a fine.  But it is hoped that the return of the books may go some way to improving the two nations' tetchy relations.  Peru's foreign minister said the move would strengthen bilateral relations.  Chile's director of Libraries, Archives and Museums said it signalled a deep commitment to building a relationship of brotherhood between the two countries.  Relations have been strained ever since the books - 2,500kg (5,500 lbs) of them - were stolen by Chilean soldiers occupying Peru's capital more than 120 years ago.  In the war, which lasted from 1879 to 1883, Peru lost territory and neighbouring Bolivia lost its coastline.  The theft of the volumes - written in Greek, Latin, French and Spanish, many dating back to the 16th Century - is an example of how, historically, many Peruvians see their neighbours to the south.  In their view, whether it is territory, maritime borders or pisco (brandy), the Chileans, at some point, stole what was rightfully Peruvian.  While the countries' governments are probably friendlier than they have ever been, there is still a perennial dispute over maritime borders which Peru has threatened to take to the International Court.  There is also ongoing rivalry in cyberspace as Peruvian and Chilean hackers battle to post patriotic messages on each other's government websites.  Last week, a Peruvian flag with the message ""Long live Peru"", followed by an expletive, was posted on the official website of Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.  It will take more than a return of a few library books to quell the countries' historic rivalry."
294,"The female Amur leopard cub, which remains unnamed, was born at Marwell Zoo, Hampshire, in November.  A recent census found less than 35 of the creatures, which like to roam large areas of wilderness, left in the wild in far eastern Russia.  Members of the public have been invited to suggest names for the cub online.  The birth was part of a European conservation breeding programme to try to save the breed from extinction.  Until now the three-month-old cub has been kept inside with its mother Ascha.  Last week it experienced its first human contact, when it was sedated and taken for a check up by zoo staff.  Amur leopards were once found in the forests of Russia, Korea and China but their range has diminished due to poaching, as well as the loss of their habitat due to competition with humans for land.  The Wildlife Conservation Society, which carried out the census of Amur leopards, has classified the breed as endangered and threatened with extinction.  ""As well as risks posed by man, the small worldwide population size means that the species is particularly vulnerable to inbreeding which can cause genetic problems including reduced fertility.  ""Plans are in place to begin the long process of reintroducing the species back to the wild.""  In 2005 the zoo bred an Amur leopard called Amirah, but the three-month-old cub entered its father's enclosure and was mauled to death in front of visitors.  In 2003 a two-year-old Amur leopard at the zoo, called Jade, escaped from her enclosure into a tree, but died after falling four metres (13ft) when it was shot by a tranquilliser dart."
295,"Labour MSPs have warned that Old Firm fans are in danger of losing trust in the police over the implementation of the law to crack down on sectarianism.  Michael McMahon and Hugh Henry spoke in light of a protest by the Green Brigade of Celtic fans in Glasgow on Saturday.  In response, the Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said the march had been held without the rightful authority of the council.  The minister also insisted that the anti-sectarianism act was working well.  During topical questions in the Holyrood chamber, Mr McMahon said Celtic fans had asked for an inquiry into the policing of the unofficial protest.  Thirteen people were arrested for alleged public order offences at the demonstration which took place outside the Chrystal Bell pub in Gallowgate.  Prior to the march, the Green Brigade had posted on its website that it would be holding a ""corteo to Celtic Park to raise awareness and show support for the growing list of Celtic supporters receiving and facing bans"" from both the Scottish Premier League football club and the procurator fiscal.  Mr McMahon believed the actions by officers were heavy handed and unnecessary.  ""Topical Question number two also provoked controversy. It concerned the demonstration by the Green Brigade of Celtic fans on Saturday in protest at what they see as the inappropriate implementation by the police of the act designed to target sectarianism in connection with football. Labour's Michael McMahon said MSPs should view the events at the weekend with ""shock and alarm"". He said the act appeared to many to be counter-productive, causing trouble which it was designed to forestall. His colleague Hugh Henry said there was now a danger that both Celtic and Rangers fans would lose confidence in the police. But the Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill gave little ground. The demo on Saturday, he said, had not adhered to the requirement to provide prior notice to the local council - and had therefore not obtained consent. People were entitled to demonstrate - but not illegally.""  He told the chamber: ""Last week at Justice Questions I raised the concerns expressed by lawyers, academics and football fans that the offensive behaviour act and the policing of it was failing to tackle the problem of sectarianism in Scotland and was in fact raising tensions and being counter productive.  ""In response through the harassment, victimisation and disproportionate actions of the police in pursing the act, a protest was held in Saturday by Celtic fans.  ""Sadly, it is now being widely alleged by not only fans, but QCs and independent legal advisers who attended on Saturday that the event was met with the very harassment, victimisation and the disproportionate action from the police which the fans where protesting against in the first place.""  Mr Henry also raised the issue of disgruntled football fans. He said the matter did not just concern marches and protests.  He added that he had received several complaints from both Celtic and Rangers fans concerned about being harassed by police.  Mr Henry called for the issue to be addressed before fans ""lose confidence in the police"".  Mr MacAskill: ""Decisions on operation policing are clearly a matter for the chief constable, but we have complete faith in our police officers to take necessary and appropriate actions to tackle those who break the law.""  He added that Strathclyde Police would be happy to brief any member on the recent events.  Mr MacAskill said CCTV footage was being examined from the march and would be available for members to view after the conclusion of legal proceedings."
296,"Scotland's new sectarian law is being used to good effect, according the country's lord advocate.  Frank Mulholland's comments came in wake of statistics on how the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act was being used.  Since the law was introduced in March, 89% of all cases have been prosecuted with 83% resulting in conviction.  The new law was designed to reduce religious hatred associated with football.  The two new offences it created included one covering behaviour in and around football matches and the other was related to messages sent by post or electronic means.  Anyone convicted under the new legislation could face a prison sentence of up to five years.  Mr Mulholland said: ""Attending football matches or simply supporting your team, wherever that may be, should be an enjoyable experience for all and should not be spoiled by the small minority.  ""Football authorities and the clubs are playing their part to tackle the problem with such initiatives as Show Racism and Bigotry the Red Card and we will continue working with them, police and other agencies, adopting a zero-tolerance approach to those who are involved in promoting sectarianism, religious offences and football related disorder and violence of any kind.""  Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs Roseanna Cunningham hailed the new powers as a step towards ""eradicating sectarianism and other unacceptable expressions of hate"" from the national game""."
297,"Thirteen arrests have been made after police moved in to break up what they said was an unauthorised march by the Green Brigade group of Celtic fans.  Almost 200 officers were deployed to the gathering outside the Chrystal Bell pub in Glasgow's Gallowgate.  Police said the crowd ""appeared to be attempting to stage an illegal street procession and officers were deployed to prevent this"".  The arrests were made for alleged public order offences.  The Green Brigade had posted on its website ahead of the protest that it would be holding a ""corteo to Celtic Park to raise awareness and show support for the growing list of Celtic supporters receiving and facing bans"" from both the Scottish Premier League football club and the procurator fiscal.  It warned those taking part that police would ""use every and any excuse to instigate trouble"".  Strathclyde Police said many of the people at the pub ""were wearing similar hooded tops and using scarves to hide their identities"" at about 13:00.  ""The crowd were instructed that any procession on the road was illegal but that officers would facilitate a safe and orderly procession on the pavements toward their intended destination at Celtic Park,"" said a statement.  ""However, this was ignored and more officers were deployed as the crowd became increasingly confrontational and aggressive.  ""The situation was contained a short time later. CCTV and helicopter footage was captured and will be studied as part of the investigation.""  Officers, including mounted personnel, who had already been deployed to deal with a number of planned events across the city had been diverted to deal with the incident.  Celtic manager Neil Lennon has previously praised the Green Brigade for the atmosphere they create inside the stadium but also urged a minority to stop singing pro-Irish Republican songs.  Ahead of the protest before the home match against Aberdeen, the Green Brigade said: ""It is no secret the level of harassment many fans receive at the hands of Strathclyde Police.  ""Nor is Celtic plc's complicity able to be ignored. As such, there is an ever-growing list of fans being denied their passion of following their team.  ""Unlike previous corteos held by the Green Brigade, this one has a little more meaning.  ""While we urge as many fans as possible to turn out in support of all those currently banned and those facing ongoing harassment, it is important to remember the purpose behind this march.  ""Therefore, we would appreciate it if colour was kept to a minimum in the form of flags and banners; similarly any chanting should be kept relevant to the topic at hand.  ""The Green Brigade will be supplying 300 black t-shirts bearing the slogan 'The banned Bhoys stand with us' and these will be distributed to section members.  ""We'd appreciate it if these shirts were worn on the march and also within the stadium to further highlight the situation.""  The fans group claimed it would be police who would instigated any trouble, adding: ""Please be mindful of the police presence and their actions. Please do not play into their hands.

A series of eruptions followed, burying streets and buildings around the island, submerging the capital, Plymouth, like a modern-day Pompeii.  Volcanic eruptions devastated two-thirds of this British overseas territory, which now looks like a barren lunar landscape.  Lazelle Howes was the island's Minister for Health, Education and Community Services at the time of the eruptions - she was also in charge of the relocation of refugees to the UK.  ""Every time I see the pictures of the residents and what they're going through in New Orleans everything comes back to me.""  Peter Kokelaar, a volcanologist who was on the team assessing the UK's handling of the crisis, says the ""tardiness of the government in making adequate provision for the evacuees in the north did cause considerable hardship"".  By August 1997, he says, there were still 1,600 people living in shelters.  The decision to evacuate the island or stay was destroying the community and families.  The last great eruption of rocks ash and rubble from this volcano killed 19 people in June 1997. Rosemond Brown's father, Joseph, was among them.  ""On the morning of the big eruption that killed all these people he went back in, said he was going to sleep, take a nap, and that was the last of him,"" she recalls.  Two-thirds of the island's population of about 11,500 people left the island - 4,000 of them travelled to the UK.

""My sister lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, and I couldn't get word about whether she was dead or alive until about two days ago.""

Shirley Spycalla, although living in the so-called ""safe"" north zone of the island, can still see the volcano from her window.  She decided to stay on the island throughout the crisis.  ""We've learnt to live with it... and what we have learnt to do is to buy brooms, lots of brooms because when it starts to ash we clean up right away,"" she says.  ""There's something very special about this island I wouldn't change this for anywhere in the world."""

Songs such as Clapton's Rush, Michael's Careless Whisper and The Eagles' Hotel California are often used as background music on Iranian TV programmes.  Songs by American easy-listening artist Kenny G are also often featured.  ""This is terrible,"" said Iranian guitarist Babak Riahipour, a musician whose songs featured on state TV and radio.

""Supervision of content from films, TV series and their voice-overs is emphasized in order to support spiritual cinema and to eliminate trite and violence,"" the council said on its website in reference to the October ruling.  Mr Ahmadinejad's programme has included sacking more moderate members of the government and replacing them with ex-military commanders and politically inexperienced religious leaders.

He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar.  In 1962, Khomeini was arrested by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero. In 1964, he was exiled, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah. By the late 1970s, the shah had become deeply unpopular and there were riots, strikes and mass demonstrations across the country.  In January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph. There was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life. Islamic law was introduced across the country. His denunciation of American influence led to militant Islamic students storming the US Embassy in Teheran in November 1979. Some of the American hostages were held captive for more than a year.  In September 1980, after a territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway, Iraq launched a surprise invasion of Iran. The resulting war lasted eight years and between half and one-and-a-half million people died. Neither side achieved their aim of toppling the other's regime. The war extinguished some of the zeal of the Islamic revolution in Iran and led some Iranians to question the capabilities of their leaders.  In February 1989 Khomeini provoked international controversy by issuing a 'fatwa', ordering Muslims to kill the writer Salman Rushdie for his novel 'The Satanic Verses'."
301,"Fighting began around the stadium almost two hours before kick-off A man has been stabbed in the chest during ""large-scale trouble"" involving hundreds of fans at West Ham's Carling Cup match against Millwall. Fights broke out at 1800 BST and were still raging five hours later. A 44-year-old man is stable after being stabbed in Priory Road at 2025 BST. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said missiles had been thrown at officers but none were injured. By 2300 BST several hundred West Ham fans had congregated outside the stadium chanting and bombarding police with crates and bottles. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The first pitch invasion was after West Ham's equaliser, while the second more serious invasion happened after they scored a penalty. It took officials about six minutes to clear about 50 people from the pitch and police had to redeploy within the stadium to tackle the invasion. West Ham won the game 3-1 after extra time, upon which there was a third invasion by hundreds of fans. About 200 riot police and at least 20 mounted officers were at the ground and a police helicopter circled the area. The Press Association quoted an unnamed 19-year-old saying he saw a police officer being kicked on the ground. The police spokesman said: ""There is large-scale trouble involving hundreds of fans which we are dealing with at the moment. About 50 fans invaded the pitch after West Ham equalised ""Officers are now containing it but there is still disorder. Hundreds of fans are estimated to be involved."" One pub reportedly had its windows broken by bricks during running battles across several streets up to half a mile from the stadium. Eyewitnesses told of hooligans trying to rip out bollards and lighting ""small fires"". Five arrests have been confirmed, including one for affray and one for breaching a banning order. BBC radio reporter Ben Jacobs, who was at the stadium, said: ""The trouble broke out outside the Tube station about 600 yards from the ground. ""There were [hundreds of] riot police and Millwall fans managed to break through the divide."" Tony, a steward at the game, told BBC Radio 5 live they were powerless to stop the violence. He said: ""When you have 2,900 Millwall fans it is really intimidating. ""There is not a lot you can do - you have to hope the police presence can help you out."" There were loads of people with bloodied faces    A 29-year-old man had to close his kebab shop in nearby Green Street for two hours. He said: ""All hell broke loose - it was very frightening. ""Bottles and bricks were being thrown from the back and some were hitting West Ham fans at the front. ""There were loads of people with bloodied faces."" Aaron Smith, from Hemel Hempstead, who was at the game, said: ""I saw one man cornered by at least a dozen Millwall fans before kick-off. Terrifying scenes."" And a Millwall fan told the BBC: ""It was like a war zone outside the stadium. There was fighting all round. ""I brought my kids with me tonight and they've seen some violence that is indescribable."" A Football Association spokesman said: ""We absolutely condemn the disorder. ""We expect all culprits to be banned from football for life - they have no place in our game.""     "
302,"Harry Redknapp's shock departure from West Ham was caused by a row over transfer cash with chairman Terry Brown. West Ham announced Rednapp had left the manager's hotseat ""by mutual consent"" - but it has emerged there was a dispute over the club's potential summer transfer fund. Redknapp and Brown disagreed over what the club needed to be competitive next season. Redknapp felt this left him with no option. 1976: Brentford is the next stop and he makes just one League outing 1987: Guides the club to the Division Three championship 1990: The Cherries are relegated back to the Third Division The 54-year-old Redknapp said it was the toughest decision of his life to turn his back on the club he had come to love. Redknapp had hoped to strengthen his squad with the remainder of the £18m he raked in from the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United last season, but he said they needed more. But it is understood there was a belief inside the club that Redknapp had not spent wisely. Redknapp said: ""I said we need to spend £12-14 million on three or four quality players just to avoid standing still."" Charlton Athletic boss Alan Curbishley is the firm favourite to take over - although West Ham will face fierce opposition inside The Valley if they attempt to land him. Redknapp's departure came after a season which saw the London club struggle in the league. West Ham only secured their top-flight status with victory against Southampton in the penultimate game of the campaign. They beat Manchester United in the FA Cup but that adventure came to an end with a quarter-final defeat by Tottenham. Redknapp, a former player at Upton Park, had been in charge since August 1994 and was the second longest-serving manager in the top-flight behind Sir Alex Ferguson. Redknapp's assistant Frank Lampard senior also left the club and Glenn Roeder will take over as caretaker manager for West Ham's final game of the season against Middlesbrough. But former Hammers striker Tony Cottee was surprised by Redknapp's departure. He said: ""They've gone from being a team that fights relegation every season to, until this season, an established top 10 Premiership club."" Ferdinand, who was sold by West Ham to Leeds for £18m, said: ""Harry gave me my chance in football and I will always appreciate that.

Redknapp had said that the Upton Park side needed three more players to help secure a finish in the top-half of the Premiership next season. Doubts surround Redknapp's future plans, but he has already been linked as the next Southampton boss because of his south-coast connection. Rednapp revealed: ""A lot of people have linked me to the Southampton vacancy but I haven't spoken to anyone at The Dell."""

304,"West Ham suffered the agony of relegation to Division One after Bolton beat Middlesbrough to preserve their own Premiership status.  The Hammers bowed out of the top flight bravely, with Paolo Di Canio making another dramatic late entry to restore parity for the Londoners.  But West Ham, for whom Les Ferdinand opened the scoring, were never in charge of their own destiny, relying on Middlesbrough to defeat Sam Allardyce's men.  Moments before Bolton took the lead in their game, Birmingham defender Matthew Upson burst one of the balloons that had accompanied Christophe Dugarry's signing of a two-year deal to stay at St Andrews.  It was a symbolic act that drew comparison with West Ham's own anthem ""I'm forever blowing bubbles"".  Ultimately, West Ham's dreams of staying in the Premiership faded the minute Per Frandsen struck for Bolton.  Caretaker manager Trevor Brooking could only look on in despair from the sidelines, the Upton Park hero unable to engineer what would surely have been one of football's greatest escapes.  No team that has been bottom of the table at Christmas has survived the drop and the Hammers could not buck that trend despite taking 19 points from their last 10 games.  And the end of West Ham's 10-season sojourn in the top flight comes at heavy price, with the debt-ridden club expected to lose a hefty £10m in television revenue.  For their part, Birmingham can bask in the glory of finishing above rivals Aston Villa.  Geoff Horsfield and Stern John grabbed the goals that earned Birmingham a point, thereby ending an excellent first season back in the big time on a high note.  Brooking kept faith with the side that had beaten Chelsea so dramatically last week.  The attacking triumvirate of Frederic Kanoute, Jermain Defoe and Ferdinand initially posed the Birmingham defence all kinds of problems.  Defoe wasted a glorious opportunity to open the scoring for the visitors, dithering over Ferdinand's through ball when an instinctive first-time shot was required.  Birmingham took heed of the early warning and proceeded to play the better football in what was an entertaining opening period.  Dugarry showed the touches of class that have so endeared him to the Birmingham fans and it was the hosts who ended the first half in the ascendancy.  After the interval, West Ham laid seige to the Birmingham goal and finally got the breakthrough they deserved when Ferdinand expertly headed in Joe Cole's cross from the left.  The visitors were buoyed by their opener and Kanoute almost doubled their advantage only to see his brilliant volley strike the post.  With only 10 minutes remaining, Horsfield and substitute John then broke West Ham's hearts, before Di Canio struck late on - a goal that proved scant consolation.  West Ham fans will be left to reflect on a season that promised much following their seventh-placed finish last year, yet delivered nothing but heartache.  The scenes of despair at St Andrews were in stark contrast to the jubilant atmosphere at Bolton, who can look forward to another season in the Premiership.  First Division football now beckons for West Ham.  But that is not the only thing on the horizon as the Premiership vultures begin to circle the likes of Defoe, Cole, Michael Carrick and Glen Johnson."
305,"Perennial Cockney bridesmaids West Ham United owe their existence to a Mr Dave Taylor, foreman of a shipbuilding company in Canning Town, East London. When he formed Thames Ironworks Football Club in 1895, it is unlikely that he envisaged a legacy that would stretch far beyond his lifetime. Since then, the club have become famous for stylish underachievement and passionate local support, bolstered from afar by such luminaries as Dave Grohl, John Cleese and the keyboard player from the Cure.  Thames Ironworks proved to be a highly effective outfit, which may surprise those familiar with their victory-suspicious modern counterparts. In their first ever match, they drew 1-1 with Royal Ordnance, the game taking place at Hermit Road, Canning Town. The club quickly attracted attention by using experimental floodlighting fashioned from dockside equipment, although this was not enough to prevent them being evicted from Hermit Road and being obliged to play their 'home' games in the newly formed London League at their opponent's venues. Nonetheless, they finished second, which says something for the quality of the team.  In June 1900, the gallant Ironworks side was dissolved as the club became steadily more professional, and immediately reformed as West Ham United Football Club. However, an echo of the 19th Century team can still be found in the club's nickname - 'The Irons' - and the cry of 'Come on you Irons!' that on match days rings around their home ground, Upton Park. The club moved here in 1904. Although universally referred to as Upton Park, the official name is actually the Boleyn Ground, the stadium being built on the site of Green Street House, a residence once owned by Anne Boleyn. The Boleyn pub is the only clue to this former royal property: on match days, it is full of vocal West Ham supporters of a particularly physical kind, and incursions by visiting fans are ill advised and usually brief . The first game at Upton Park was a 3-1 win over mortal enemies Millwall . Games between the sides have been rare over the years, but are marked with great animosity, which usually translates into widespread crowd disorder.  The club crest of two crossed shipbuilding hammers on a castle motif reflects both the team's origins and this tenuous royal connection. It also accounts for the clubs 'other' nickname, the Hammers. It was at the time of the move to Upton Park that the famous claret and blue strip was instigated, the original shirts being sewn together from off-cuts of material supplied by a nearby upholstery shop. Under the gaze of the club's first manager, Syd King, West Ham fared reasonably well until the outbreak of World War One, when many players were lost on the battlefields of France. King served as the club's manager for 30 years, establishing a tradition of continuity and long service - at time of writing, there have only been nine managers in the club's 107-year history.  In 1927, an advertising campaign appeared for soap. It featured a curly haired child blowing soap bubbles, who was likened to one of the West Ham players. This unlikely imagery provided the Hammers with their club anthem, which is roared by supporters several times during the course of a game. The lyrics are as follows:  It is an oddly sentimental rallying cry, although as many have ruefully reflected, fortune usually has hidden for West Ham.  West Ham have always been something of a middling force in English football, reluctant to abandon laudable - if not always advisable - attacking flair for a more robust and rounded tactical approach. While this invariably makes the team very entertaining to watch, it does not over burden them in the trophy department. Most of their history has been spent fluttering between the top two divisions, usually spending three or four seasons in the top flight, before stepping outside for a bit of a breather. Tactically, the team are often too fragile to sustain the level of consistency required for a sustained league campaign. But every dog has his day, and the Hammers have had a few...  The FA Cup is the oldest football competition in the world, laden with romance and an epic, legendary quality all of its own. For the uninitiated, it is a knock out competition, in which teams of all leagues are drawn randomly against each other. Upsets are common - West Ham have tumbled out of the Cup to lowly opposition on more than one occasion - but it is also the competition in which they have enjoyed the most success, with three wins in four Finals.  Wembley Stadium opened in 1923, and West Ham managed to win through to the first FA Cup Final to be held there. Although the ground was built to hold 120,000 supporters, it is estimated that twice this number squeezed in to watch the match. Billie, a white police horse ridden by a constable Storey, became an instant legend as he gently nudged the vast crowd away from the pitch in order that some semblance of normality could be restored. The game kicked off forty-four minutes late, with human touchlines and frequent incursions onto the pitch. The Hammers, playing as ever with the happy contentment of a team who understand that it is the taking part that is the important thing, lost 2-0 to Bolton Wanderers. The game is known in FA Cup lore as 'The White Horse Final'.  West Ham again appeared at Wembley in 1964, this time in a thrilling match against Preston North End, coming from behind twice to snatch victory 3-2 with a last-gasp winner from Ronnie Boyce. Hammers striker Sissons became the youngest Cup Final goal scorer, and the team held the nucleus of England's World Cup winning side of 1966, with scorer Geoff Hurst and captain Bobby Moore, perhaps the best loved English footballer of all time. West Ham fans regularly assert that it was actually West Ham that beat the Germans in 1966, not England.  1975 saw a 2-0 victory against a Fulham side containing Upton Park legend Bobby Moore, playing at the tail end of his career, and West Ham's last triumph was as underdogs against Arsenal in 1980, winning an unspectacular, overly tactical affair, adversely affected by the extraordinary heat. In this match, West Ham midfielder Paul Allen became the youngest player ever to appear in an FA Cup Final - and he should have scored, being cruelly hacked down by Arsenal's Willie Young when clean through on goal, an action that still ruffles feathers at Upton Park. Hammers favourite-turned-pundit Trevor Brooking headed the only goal to seal an unexpected victory.  European success arrived in 1965, as TSV Munich were beaten 2-0 at Wembley. This has thus far been the only European achievement: West Ham lost to Belgian side Anderlecht 4-2 in the final of the same competition in 1976.  West Ham's modestly-sized trophy cabinet is complete with Second Division titles in 1958 and 1981. At time of writing, the club's highest league placing was a remarkable third place in the pre-Premiership First Division in 1986.  Upton Park tube, towards the eastern end of the District and Hammersmith and City Lines, is by far the easiest option. Out of the station, turn right, and walk past the burger stands, chestnut sellers and vendors shouting 'Wear yer cullas! 'ats, scarves and baydges!' until you see the ground. Don't make the classic amateur error and alight at West Ham tube. Although you can catch a bus to the ground from here, you are more likely to get lost in one of the least glorious parts of London. For the same reason, victuals are best partaken of at Liverpool Street, where Central London ends and East London begins. The hooliganism for which West Ham is notorious may be smaller scale these days, but there are still plenty of random scamps about who will happily ruin your afternoon, so it is best to stay 'in town' for refreshment purposes. The overwhelming majority of West Ham fans that cram onto the tube as it winds through East London are, however, a friendly and chatty bunch, especially toward supporters of lesser-known teams. Despite a somewhat tainted reputation, the denizens of Upton Park are appreciative of good football and good support, whomever is providing it. They know that West Ham's traditional encouragement of local talent and commitment to attractive, flowing play has often seen the club at odds with the pressures of the wider football world - but frankly, that's how they like it."
306,"Sam Allardyce has revealed he planned to leave West Ham United even if the club had offered to renew his contract.  Allardyce's departure was announced within minutes of West Ham's 2-0 loss at Newcastle United that saw the Magpies stay in the Premier League.  The 60-year-old has spent four years at West Ham, but the Hammers have decided not to renew his deal this summer.  Allardyce said: ""I didn't want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either.""  West Ham will now begin the search for a successor, although they look likely to miss out on top target Rafael Benitez, as the Napoli boss is linked with Real Madrid.  ""I thought it was the right time to leave - and probably the right time for me and the club,"" added ex-Bolton and Newcastle boss Allardyce, who now plans to take an extended break from the game.  Allardyce learned of his fate on Friday, but the news was made public on Sunday afternoon at the conclusion of the 2014-15 Premier League season.  In a statement, joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said: ""We would like to start by thanking Sam Allardyce for his valuable work since arriving at the Boleyn Ground four years ago.  ""He leaves the club in a considerably better state than when he arrived and, for that, the board are truly grateful.""  Allardyce added: ""I knew it was coming and I have no problems with it. We had the discussion and I wasn't going to sign a new contract so it was probably time to move on.  ""It's done and dusted and we both move on. West Ham have a big job appointing a new manager moving forward and I have the job of seeing my family for a change. This job is 24/7 and it's time for me to give the family a bit more time.""  Sullivan and Gold want a new manager to oversee the club's final season at their current home before a move to the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 campaign.  The statement was released just minutes after West Ham lost their final Premier League game of the season 2-0 at Newcastle - a result which ensured their opponents avoided relegation and meant the Hammers finished 12th.  Allardyce says he has no intention of making a quick return to football, adding: ""For me four years is a long time and I don't want to overstay my welcome. You have to commit your whole life to being a Premier League manager.  ""It's time to have that break. I'm looking to have a break, recharge the batteries and when the batteries are recharged you are better prepared to carry on doing the job at this level.  ""It's not just a job I'm after, it's the right job. You can never say never but I can't see myself being in charge of another football club at the start of next season.""  West Ham United's supporters made it clear what they felt of the unloved Allardyce as abuse rained down from the stands at St James' Park as they lost to Newcastle United.  And while it is true the 60-year-old is a managerial taste that will never be acquired by some, Allardyce can rightly be pleased with his four years at Upton Park.  The brief from owners David Sullivan and David Gold was to get the Hammers into the Premier League and keep them there - two missions he accomplished comfortably.  Allardyce, in other words, has done a solid job at West Ham and it will take a lot to move them even further forward.  He may not have been a popular figure among the fanbase - not that he seemed to care - but this is a manager who did what he was asked to do. For that he deserves respect and credit."
307,"West Ham captain Kevin Nolan scored a hat-trick as relegated Reading bade farewell to the Premier League with a 22nd defeat of the 38-game campaign.  The Hammers took a 2-0 first-half lead with Nolan making the most of an error by keeper Alex McCarthy before Ricardo Vaz Te drilled in the second.  Reading drew level in three second-half minutes thanks to strikes from Garath McCleary and Adam Le Fondre.  But Nolan slotted home the hosts' third before nodding in a fourth late on.  West Ham dominated for large periods, although they could have been left with red faces on the final day of the season after their two-goal advantage evaporated inside the first 15 minutes of the second half following two quick-fire Royals strikes.  However, the Berkshire side showed their true colours with more erratic defending which allowed Nolan, who is not blessed with pace, to twice escape his markers and seal victory for the home side.  That win, their 12th in the league, helped Sam Allardyce's men finish 10th in the table. Reading, whose fate was sealed at the end of April, end the season in 19th, with manager Nigel Adkins likely to have already started planning for next season long before this final encounter.  His side were bullied in the first half by yet another impressive performance by Liverpool forward Andy Carroll, in the final game of his loan spell with the Hammers.  Allardyce has stated he would like to sign Carroll permanently but it has been reported that West Ham can only afford £10m - after this display his value is likely to be much higher.  He inadvertently set up the first for Nolan after McCarthy's clearance came off the back of the tall striker and landed in the path of his team-mate, who passed into the empty net.  Moments later, Carroll brilliantly plucked down Mohamed Diame's cross from the left and laid the ball off for team-mate Vaz Te to rifle in the second.  However, West Ham lost their composure after the interval. First, McCleary pulled one back for Reading with a 20-yard shot which took a heavy deflection off Mark Noble.  Less than two minutes later, Jobi McAnuff's cross from the left found substitute Le Fondre at the far post for an easy tap-in.  Reading were looking favourites to pick up only their seventh league win but with 11 minutes remaining they were undone by a slick Hammers move as Nolan tucked home after running on to a clipped ball from Noble.  And with Reading spirits dampened, Nolan completed his hat-trick in the 87th minute with a header from Modibo Maiga's right-wing cross.  ""Great credit to the players, they showed really good character and in the second half we came out and scored two good goals.  ""We were in the ascendancy up until they scored the third.  ""That was a shame but it's what you do in both penalty areas.  ""There is a good feelgood factor going forward for next season, which is important.""

308,"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe at the RST, reviewd by site user Liz Melia    The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe became a magnificent visual spectacle in the hands of the RSC and though there were flaws, none were enough to mar the excellence of the production.     Though this is the third production of CS Lewis' tale to be staged in Stratford in recent years, it should still be a guaranteed success as it will enthrall the young - and young at heart - time and time again.    The audience was allowed to escape - via a wardrobe - with four young siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, from life as evacuees to Narnia, a land enchanted by the White Witch to make it always winter but never Christmas.     Patrice Naiambana's movements and sounds as noble lion Aslan and the work of Mr and Mrs Beaver bring the animals to life and it is easy to see how children could forget this wasn't real. There wasn't too much dialogue to distract from the essentially visual production, which made it particularly accessible to younger members of the audience - something often lacking in this type of production.    The extravagant set and spotlights made for a real fairytale experience. The costumes were fabulous, from the glamorous White Witch to the surreal creatures, and the continuous action made it impossible to look away from the stage.    Effects and staging were also astounding - as even though they were mainly low-tech, the falling snow, Lucy and Susan's ride on Aslan's back and the journey through the wardrobe they really transported you into the action.    The cast, as an ensemble, was strong and it's difficult to spotlight those who really stood out although Joanne Pearce was outstanding as the Cruella DeVil-like White Witch.     The ham-evil of the witch was ever-so-slightly camp and diluted what could have been terrifying scenes, particularly those with the leather-clad wolves, for smaller children.    Ingenius tricks used in make-up and wardrobe transform the cast into forest and jungle creatures - the witch's reindeer, the rat, eagle and centaurs looked fantastic - but it was strength of performance that made the animals.    Patrice Naiambana's movements and sounds as noble lion Aslan and the work of Mr and Mrs Beaver bring the animals to life and it is easy to see how children could forget this wasn't real.     Some of the solo singing was not that strong - though when the cast gathered together it lit up the stage. Some of the acting from the four young evacuees was a tad tiresome as well at times (some stage-school shouting) but not often.    To keep young children (and restless adults) enthralled in a performance for more than two hours was no mean feat - and I'm sure the children and adults gained equal pleasure from the production.    It was also almost possible to forget this is an allegorical take on Christianty and become instead embroiled in an epic fairy tale of the old-fashioned, non-political persuasion.     "
309,"Controversial plans to build a mosque in Camberley have been thrown out by councillors at a heated meeting. The local Bengali Association's bid to knock down a listed building and build a domed mosque was rejected by Surrey Heath Borough Council. Local historians and residents had argued the town's heritage must be protected and opposed the plans. Abdul Mojid, who chairs the association, said they would consider whether to appeal against the decision. More than 350 people packed into Camberley Theatre in Knoll Road, with some residents queuing from 0900 GMT for a ticket. The plan involved knocking down the listed Victorian school building in London Road, which is about half a mile from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. It was originally home to Yorktown Infants and Primary schools, before later becoming St Gregory's Roman Catholic school. When the school closed, the building was sold to the Berkshire, Hampshire & Surrey Bengali Welfare Association (BWA) which has been using it as an Islamic centre since 1996. The association argued that the building no longer met the needs of the growing local Muslim community, and people wanted to worship in a mosque and not in a school. The plans had been approved by the council's planning committee earlier this year, but overturned on a technicality. The school building has been used as an Islamic centre since 1996 Nahrni Choudhury, who spoke at the meeting on behalf of the BWA, accused some of the campaigners of racism. Speaking after the meeting, she said: ""I am upset. It's not just about what the buildings will be. ""It's about the fact that we are Muslims and we are an ethnic minority and they don't want to see a mosque here."" Conservative council leader Moira Gibson admitted there were ""a few racist elements"" but said said she did not think the campaign was fuelled by Islamophobia. Please turn on JavaScript.

""It's about being progressive but actually preserving part of the history of Surrey Heath and Camberley.""

310,"Their investigation follows reports that men bitten by the Phoneutria nigriventer experienced priapism - long and painful erections.  A two-year study has found that the venom contains a toxin, called Tx2-6, that causes erections.  Further tests are being carried out in the US before the substance can be approved for human use.  The results, from the Medical College of Georgia, are expected in a month's time.  The bite of Phoneutria nigriventer, known as the Brazilian wandering spider, is potent and can be deadly in some cases.  The Brazilian and US researchers interviewed men who claimed their sex lives had improved after a spider attack.  The relevant toxin identified in the venom has been tested successfully on other animals.  So far, scientists believe that combining a version of the spider's venom with an existing drug for erectile dysfunction - such as Viagra, Cialis or Levtra - could produce better results."
311,"More than 3,000 mourners paid tribute to the 28-year-old, who collapsed and died during the Confederations Cup semi-final against Colombia in France on 26 June.  Prime minister Peter Musonge led government and international personalities in the short burial ceremony that preceded a three-hour long church service in the Yaounde Notre Dame des Victoires cathedral.  There were military honours, short prayer and traditional rites before the fallen hero was decorated posthumously as commander of the national order of valour by Musonge.  He was then buried in the middle of the four hectare sports complex.  President Paul Biya attended the church service but did not go to the burial ground.  The service was led by Bishop Jerome Owono Minboe, who talked about hypocrisy and the need for people to live pure lives.  Six eulogies were read by members of Foe's family, the Cameroon FA, skipper of the national side Rigobert Song and Fifa president Sepp Blatter.  The speakers praised the departed star for his talent and service to humanity.  Joseph Mbende and Joseph Nkono, who spoke on behalf of the bereaved family, appealed for the completion of Foe's sports complex, with an estimated cost standing at around £3.5m.  A day before the burial the remains were exposed in the Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium, home to the Indomitable Lions, with over 30,000 people turning out in tribute to Foe."
312,"Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe has died after collapsing during an international match in France.  The 28-year-old fell to the ground unchallenged in the 72nd minute of a Confederations Cup semi-final against Colombia in Lyon.  He was treated on the pitch before being stretchered off and receiving further treatment, including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and extra oxygen.  Foe spent last season on loan at English club Manchester City from French club Olympique Lyon and also played for RC Lens.  Medical staff are believed to have tried to restart his heart for 45 minutes but without success.  ""The player was still alive when he was taken to the medical centre in Gerland Stadium in Lyon, where he died,"" said Alfred Mueller, Fifa's Swiss medical officer for Lyon.  ""It is too early to determine the exact causes of his death.""  An autopsy will be carried out to determine the cause of his death.  After paying a tearful tribute to Foe, France beat Turkey 3-2 in the other Confederation Cup semi-final.  Fifa president Sepp Blatter said: ""Fifa and the whole family of football are shattered by this unbelievable tragedy.  ""On their behalf, I wish to convey our sincerest condolences to his family and loved ones, to Cameroon football and his club, and express all our support at this painful time.  Blatter also said that the Confederations Cup final between France and Cameroon will definitely go ahead on Sunday.  France captain Marcel Desailly had questioned whether or not the game should take place.  ""I would totally understand if the Cameroon team refused to take part in the final,"" he said."
313,"The fire was reportedly centred on Camden Canal Market, to the east of Chalk Farm Road.  Police closed off several roads and the Hawley Arms pub, near the source of the fire, suffered severe damage.  London Fire Brigade has said the blaze is being brought under control and there are no reports of casualties.  LFB station manager Guy Foster said the fire was centred around Camden Canal Market, where a number of market stalls had caught fire.  He said the train line between Camden Road and Kentish Town West had been shut down.  Residents have also been evacuated from some houses and flats.  Firefighters were alerted at about 7.20pm on Saturday to the blaze which has reportedly consumed part of the Hawley Arms, a popular Camden pub which is frequented by celebrities including singer Amy Winehouse.  There were unconfirmed reports that some people were trapped, but London Fire Brigade spokesman Nick Comery said he had heard nothing to support that.  He told BBC News 24: ""It's an ongoing job and we are doing our best to bring it under control and to stop it spreading.  ""It involves currently some market storage properties, shops and dwellings.  ""It is a large area that is involved. It is a severe fire, there is a lot of smoke going up into the sky.""  BBC News reporter James Cooke said the fire appeared to have broken out in a row of shops.  Revellers from local pubs and bars were moved away from the danger area, where flames were leaping up to 30ft in the air.  Conservative mayoral candidate Boris Johnson said: ""This will come as a terrible blow to their livelihoods and the area generally. My thoughts are with the traders, local residents and the emergency services who are, as usual, performing brilliantly under pressure.""  London Ambulance Service said it has ambulances and a hazardous response team at the scene.  Seth Owuadey, 48, who lives in Kentish Town, was in a bar opposite the Hawley Arms and saw the first flames as they grew stronger.  ""A fire engine arrived but it took about 40 minutes for more to come, even though by then the flames were the height of a house.  ""We thought it started in the Hawley Arms, but it started in an alleyway behind there.""  Moira Smith, 46, also of Kentish Town, saw the flames out of the window of her home ""and the next minute, it was on the news"".  Sitting on a bar stool in the middle of the road at the edge of the cordon in Chalk Farm Road, she said: ""You could tell it was serious. The smoke was black.  ""I'm just shocked by it all. Please God, there'll be no casualties.""  The markets area is a major tourist attraction attracting up to 300,000 visitors each weekend to its six open-air and indoor markets and vibrant mix of bars, clubs, shops and restaurants."
314,"Punk Rocker Sid Vicious has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen was found in their New York hotel room.  The former Sex Pistol and Miss Spungen were staying in a room at the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.  Staff said Mr Vicious phoned room service to raise the alarm and then ran downstairs saying ""something's happened to my girl"".  Police called to the scene handcuffed Mr Vicious. As he was led away he shouted at a small crowd gathered to ""sod off"".  A New York police department spokesman says he will face a murder charge under his real name, John Ritchie. If proven guilty he could face life imprisonment.  The controversial punk rock star met Miss Spungen in London last year and moved to New York to work on a career outside of the Sex Pistols.  The band effectively split in January after lead singer Johnny Rotten walked out at the end of their US tour.  Police say Miss Spungen was found in Room 100 dressed only in her underwear with stab wounds to her stomach. They also retrieved ""drugs paraphernalia"".  The pair were in the spotlight earlier this year after being charged in London for possession of amphetamine. Friends say recently they had been visiting heroin addiction clinics.  Malcolm McLaren, Sid Vicious' manager, is expected to fly out to New York on the first plane tomorrow.  He said: ""I can't believe he was involved in such a thing. Sid was set to marry Nancy in New York. He was very close to her and had quite a passionate affair with her.""  But the former bass player's mother, Anne Beverley was critical of her son's relationship with Miss Spungen:  ""I didn't like his girl. I called her Nauseating Nancy. She was a bad influence on my Sid."""
315,"The shootings on Sunday have left the small town of Crandon, in the north of the Midwestern state, in shock.  The gunman, named as Tyler Peterson, 20, worked full-time as a deputy sheriff in Forest County.  As well as his ex-girlfriend, he shot two childhood friends and a 14-year-old girl. His motive is not yet known.  Police Chief John Dennee said Peterson, who also worked as a part-time police officer, was not on duty at the time of the shooting.  The incident occurred at his ex-girlfriend's house shortly before 0300 local time (0800 GMT), where the young people had gathered to watch movies and eat pizza, reports said.  A seventh youth is said to be in critical condition in hospital.  Residents of Crandon, a community of 2,000 about 225 miles (360 kilometres) north of Milwaukee, were ordered to stay in their homes while police hunted for Peterson.  At about 3pm local time he was ""brought down by a sniper"", Crandon Mayor Gary Bradley said.  ""There is probably nobody in Crandon who is not affected by this,"" Mr Peters said, adding that students would be especially affected.  ""They are going to wake up in shock and disbelief and a lot of pain.""  Jenny Stahl, whose 14-year-old daughter Lindsay was the youngest victim, said she had thought the teenager would be safer staying at a friend's house than travelling home late at night.  ""I'm waiting for somebody to wake me up right now. This is a bad, bad dream,"" Mrs Stahl said.  Bud Evans, an elder at Crandon Praise Chapel, told BBC News 24 that worried relatives had gathered at the church as they waited for news.  ""If there's five or six children or kids, young adults, whatever, involved in this, I'd know every one of them - the community's that small and that tight-knit,"" Mr Evans said.  The incident comes only six months after the Virginia Tech campus shooting, in which more than 30 people were killed."
316,"The UK is to send an infantry battle group to Afghanistan in what Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon called the biggest British troop deployment since the Gulf War.  In response to a US request the battle group, which is built around 45 Commando Royal Navy Marines, is heading to Afghanistan to battle the remnants of the Taleban and al-Qaeda forces.  Mr Hoon said: ""This a powerful force - total up to 1,700 strong.""  It also includes three Chinook helicopters of the RAF's 27 Squadron. ""These troops are being deployed to Afghanistan to take part in war fighting operations,"" he said. ""We will be asking them to risk their lives...they may suffer casualties."" Parts of 45 Commando are already in the region aboard HMS Ocean, Mr Hoon said, adding that the remaining companies were in a state of readiness in Arbroath. The defence secretary said that al-Qaeda continued to pose a threat to countries including the UK. Mr Hoon's Conservative opposite number, Bernard Jenkin, said that his party would back the deployment - although he indicated that the announcement had come as something of a surprise. A 1,500-strong security force of British troops are currently serving with the 4,500-strong International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF). The new deployment of troops will be involved in combat. The Defence Secretary told MPs that a German unit would formally assume command from the UK of the subordinate headquarters of ISAF in Kabul. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said that negotiations are still ongoing for Turkey to take over Britain's primary role in ISAF. Mr Hoon told MPs that talks between Turkey, the UK and the US had been ""extremely positive"".  In January, Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed Afghanistan's leader Hamid Karzai to Downing Street but stopped short of offering more troops. Mr Karzai has kept up his appeal for a significantly expanded military presence in Afghanistan to help prevent renewed fighting between Afghan warlords. General Tommy Franks, head of America's Central Command said the overall mission in Afghanistan was far from over. There has continued to be hard-fought battles between US forces and some remaining Taleban and al-Qaeda strongholds."
317,"Garvey was a Jamaican-born black nationalist who created a 'Back to Africa' movement in the United States. He became an inspirational figure for later civil rights activists.  Marcus Garvey was born in St Ann's Bay, Jamaica on 17 August 1887, the youngest of 11 children. He inherited a keen interest in books from his father, a mason and made full use of the extensive family library. At the age of 14 he left school and became a printer's apprentice where he led a strike for higher wages. From 1910 to 1912, Garvey travelled in South and Central America and also visited London.  He returned to Jamaica in 1914 and founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). In 1916, Garvey moved to Harlem in New York where UNIA thrived. By now a formidable public speaker, Garvey spoke across America. He urged African-Americans to be proud of their race and return to Africa, their ancestral homeland and attracted thousands of supporters.  To facilitate the return to Africa that he advocated, in 1919 Garvey founded the Black Star Line, to provide transportation to Africa, and the Negro Factories Corporation to encourage black economic independence. Garvey also unsuccessfully tried to persuade the government of Liberia in west Africa to grant land on which black people from America could settle.  In 1922, Garvey was arrested for mail fraud in connection with the sale of stock in the Black Star Line, which had now failed. Although there were irregularities connected to the business, the prosecution was probably politically motivated, as Garvey's activities had attracted considerable government attention. Garvey was sent to prison and later deported to Jamaica. In 1935, he moved permanently to London where he died on 10 June 1940. In 1964, his body was returned to Jamaica where he was declared the country's first national hero."
318,"You are in: South Yorkshire > SY People > Profiles > Peter Stringfellow Peter Stringfellow, the son of a Sheffield steelworker, has supposedly had hundreds of girlfriends - if not thousands. He's known for having a few pounds in the bank too... We ask him about his life. Peter Stringfellow, the ladies man and strip club pioneer, has come a long way since his modest upbringing in the steel city of Sheffield. He came into BBC Radio Sheffield in 2008 to speak to Gareth Evans about his life and the famous Mojo Club on Pittsmoor Road in 1960s Sheffield. Peter was born in 1940: “I left school when I was 15 years old as it was a waste of time for me. My mum and dad recognised that I was a different kind of guy,” says Peter. ""My dad was a quiet man, born in Sheffield in 1919. I used to ask him why he went straight back to the steelworks after being through Austria, Germany, Italy, Scotland in World War 2, then back to Sheffield and his old job. He said, 'That's what we did, son'."" When he left school, Peter worked as a projectionist at the old Wicker Cinema and then The Regal. Peter recalls his father's views on his career: Kath, Peter and Jill groove on stage at Mojo, 1965 ""He did call me once when I was about 17 and said, 'Son, it's about time you got a proper job'. So I went into English Steelworks down Attercliffe way. I went there for my dad and put my notice in after two weeks. I was there for six weeks. It was a great influence: never go back again!"" Peter Stringfellow and his fiancee Bella came to Sheffield in autumn 2008 for the launch of a new book about the art of the King Mojo Club 'and Beyond...' It was published to raise money for the Sheffield Children's Hospice. Peter came in to BBC Radio Sheffield to speak to Gareth Evans about the book and the success of the Mojo. You can hear the interview by clicking on the link below. Although Peter and his brothers Paul and Geoffrey moved down to London to find their fortune in the 1980s, many of Peter Stringfellow's family still live in Sheffield: ""My brother Terry stayed up here. We've been to visit Aunty Dorothy and Uncle Patrick, we're going to see Aunt Sybil, Aunt Jean, Uncle Jack... it's nice to know the older family are still around."" The young Peter Stringfellow broke away from his roots, chasing money and girls. He ended up in the British Merchant Navy and was travelling the world at 17. “I went ashore in New York with $10 dollars in my pocket and was amazed. It was like something out of a superman comic. When I came back to Sheffield I still had New York in my head and I had something that no-one else I knew had – worldly experience and the desire to have money, and lots of it.” Soon Peter opened his first club in Sheffield, the Black Cat Club. “I had the Beatles at the Black Cat and then wanted more of what they were having. So I opened up more clubs, most notably Mojo which became one of my most successful clubs. I have no doubt in my mind that the Arctic Monkeys' [also Sheffield based] parents went to that club.” The Mojo Club was open for three years until 1966, in an old Victorian house on Pittsmoor Road. John Hall and Tina Turner at the King Mojo Club Some of the biggest names played there - Jimi Hendrix, Ike and Tina Turner, The Small Faces... but it wasn't the easiest club to get to: ""It was one bus into town, from town to the Wicker, another bus up Pittsmoor Road, maybe even another bus! You had to really want to go to the Mojo Club! ""Bus after bus used to empty the crowd. In three years, English pop exploded - The Small Faces, The Who, The Spencer Davies Group... ""We discovered soul music coming in from America. Wilson Pickett, Alvin Cash and the Crawlers came all the way to Sheffield from Philadelphia. There were Ike and Tina."" Some of the big names at the Mojo Peter Stringfellow recognises that his special skill was to mix all sorts of music under one roof, and this led to the popularity of the club. ""I mixed them all up - I liked everybody's music, not just one sort... I'd put Herman's Hermits into a blues show - you cannot really do that! ""But I think, if music's good, I like it - the genre doesn't matter."" Stringfellow recollects a visit from an American legend who at the time was a known as a ""weirdo."" ""We paid £50 for Hendrix - there's an advert in The Sheffield Star archives which says, 'The well-known weirdo Jimi Hendrix.' ""Someone tipped the police off saying that Hendrix had drugs. They didn't have a drugs squad in those days so they sent the fire brigade! The fire officer said, 'Come on then son, where are these drugs?' Jimi Hendrix had this big reefer and he said, 'Sorry man, I don't do drugs.' They had no idea and just walked out! Jimi played the most incredible set that night."" Alcohol is available almost everywhere nowadays, but when Peter started out his clubs weren't licensed: ""The Black Cat Club, The Blue Moon Club, Down Broadway - no alcohol,"" says Peter. ""I didn't get a license for alcohol until 1969 for a club I called The Penthouse."" Instead, Sheffield's teenagers hung out in Coffee Bars like Bistrotheque on Sheffield High Street. Down Broadway: the Bistrotheque, after the Mojo In February 1966 the Mojo Club was closed down by the authorities owing to ""nuisance caused by noise."" Peter Stringfellow went on to open Bistrotheque on the High Street in Sheffield, and then the successful Penthouse club. The Mojo Club wasn't just a place for progressive music - it was also a hot spot for contemporary art. Two Sheffield lads Dave Manvell and Paul Norton were responsible for nearly all the art on the walls of the club, while Colin Duffield designed the posters for this club and other successors. ""They did it for free at The Mojo Club, these boys and other art students would come and paint the place. There was lots of psychedelic art,"" says Peter. Many of the images are reproduced in the book Pop Art of Sheffield's King Mojo club and Beyond... The book includes art from the walls of other clubs - Chesterfield's Victoria Ballroom, The Ark Club in Sheffield, The Penthouse, the Bistrotheque on the High Street and more - including the high street store C&A! The book is priced at £9.99 and proceeds go to the Sheffield Children's Hospital Charity. Until the 1980s Peter had been holding normal music nights, but at this point he started selling his most profitable “product” – girls, lots and lots of girls. “I went to a strip club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in the 80’s and loved it. I then immediately opened up Stringfellows New York and it became a great success as I changed it to a strip club.” However, Peter Stringfellow's success didn’t come without any pitfalls. Other clubs in Miami and Los Angles were a disaster and put Peter in huge debt. Yet his passion and dedication didn’t falter and he was soon back on track. He converted his club in Covent Garden, London from having girls three nights a week in 1996 to rebrand it ‘Cabaret of Angels’ in 2000 when it became a strip club seven nights a week. “It’s a nice feeling having the success I have, but I have spent a lifetime getting here. I didn’t just win X-Factor!” He now sits comfortable on his throne of girls and money, but his past has been pitted with debt and critics slagging off his personal life. In 2003 he was voted by Channel 4 viewers as the 18th worst Briton. “That poll was frivolous and it just made me laugh. As you get older its just all funny.” Nothing seems to affect Peter in his personal or business life. It is all about his success and he doesn’t care what anyone else thinks. Yet is he willing to share his success with anyone else? “First of all I’m not a businessman, I’m just a bloody good club owner. I’m very autocratic and have a very good team but ultimately I make the final decision. When you work for yourself you can go bankrupt but if you’re a chairman of a PLC (Public Limited Company) then you can get a very good payoff. I would possibly consider turning the Stringfellows brand into a PLC and letting people buy shares, but I have no hot plans for it yet.” He neither confirms nor denies claims that he has slept with over 3,000 women, rather he is more focused on his future. “The past is such a long time. I now have a beautiful fiancée who I am marrying next Valentines Day and have three little dogs, two children and four grandchildren who I love all dearly.” His fiancée is 25 year old Bella Wright, a former Royal Ballet dancer. So is he finally growing up and settling down for good? “My life at the moment is fantastic and I have no plans to change. The idea of retiring is old and dated. I will continue what I’m doing my whole life as long as it keeps me happy and interested. I will see what comes my way.” Peter lives his life by the second and puts his success down to pure determination and passion. He will not settle for anything less than he desires. “If you can find something that you enjoy and can dedicate yourself to and wake up every morning and think ‘wow’, then you have it. It doesn’t have to be easy and whatever you think your future is going to be like, it’s not going to be that at all. In life you have no idea what is coming, and that is a wonderful thing.” Watch footage of Peter Stringfellow talking about his life growing up in Sheffield: The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites In November 2008, the Local Government Association called for lapdance clubs to be reclassified as ""sex encounter establishments"" (like peep shows in London) which would mean local authorities would have more say in where they are placed.

319,"Oliver, famed for his ""pukka"" catchphrase and cheeky cockney persona, has been the TV face of Sainsbury's for the past three years.  He is set to appear in a fresh series of adverts over the next 12 months.  He will also work on product launches and continue to develop recipe cards for customers, Sainsbury's said.  The retailer claims Oliver has had a direct impact on its sales, helping it to maintain its slender grip on second spot in the UK supermarket stakes, behind Tesco.  When Oliver recommended spreading truffle butter under the skin of Christmas turkeys last year, the company said, more than 50,000 jars of the product were sold.  Some advertising industry sources have even claimed Oliver's association with Sainsbury's has brought the company an extra £1bn of sales - or more than £200m in gross profit.  But many retail analysts are sceptical about Oliver's impact on Sainsbury's flagging performance.  Earlier this year, the company unveiled annual profits of £667m.  But its disappointing 2.3% increase in sales, in stores open more than a year, left investors shaking their heads.  By comparison, Tesco's annual profits were up 13% to £1.3bn, with a 4.1% in sales from existing stores.  Some analysts say Sainsbury's has already lost its second place to US-backed Asda.  Richard Ratner, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce, said no amount of Jamie Oliver's mockney charm could disguise the underlying malaise.  ""It is possible to see the effect of Jamie Oliver's endorsements on individual lines, but the overall effect is impossible to calculate.  ""It certainly hasn't had a major effect. Their like-for-like sales (discounting the effect of new store openings) are not where they would like them to be.""  TV chefs are highly prized by marketers for their ability to shift individual products.  But the impact of their endorsement is much harder to quantify across an entire retail chain.  ""I suppose it could be argued that if it wasn't for Jamie Oliver, they would be doing even worse.  ""But there isn't a Jamie Oliver line as such, so it is difficult to tell.  ""Perhaps they should stop the Jamie Oliver ads and see what effect that has on sales,"" Mr Ratner told BBC News Online.  Dominic Allport, at Mintel, said Sainsbury's were ""still struggling quite badly.""  One major problem, he said, was that they are losing ground in non-food retailing.  High profit margin items such as clothes and electrical goods are a major growth area for supermarkets.  But Sainsbury's were struggling to keep up with Tesco, and Oliver's ads, which have so far concentrated on food, are unlikely to be much help.  He said they also had few town centre stores, which would allow them to sell ""value-added products to more affluent customers.""  They also needed to move away from their strongholds in the south, open more stores in the north, where they have about 7% of the market.  But ""trying to keep pace with the juggernaut that is Tesco"" was a tough job for all UK retailers, he added.  There were signs that Sainsbury's is starting to win the battle.  But the turnaround has not been as quick as that achieved by another iconic British retailer, Marks and Spencer, which has concentrated on new product lines and store revamps.  Sainsbury's was trying out innovative ideas - such as joint ventures with the likes of Boots and Early Learning Centre - but the results were so far inconclusive, he added.  Jamie Oliver has undoubtedly generated a lot of publicity for Sainsbury, Mr Allport argued.  His recent Channel 4 series, in which he gave a group of underprivileged teenagers a chance to train as chefs had been particularly successful, helping to fend off growing cynicism about his ""pukka"" lifestyle.  But there was still a danger of over-exposure, Mr Allport argued.  ""They have got to tread carefully with Jamie Oliver. There is a fatigue effect if he is seen too much.  ""Another year is perhaps sufficient."""
320,"UK men's magazines FHM and Zoo have said they are halting publication.  FHM was launched in 1985 under the title For Him Magazine. Zoo was launched in 2004.  An online statement from publisher Bauer Media read: ""Unfortunately it's true and it has been announced today the intention to suspend publication of FHM.""  The statement added that it had been ""an absolute joy producing the magazine over the years"".  ""Thank you for all your support, we will keep you updated with developments over the coming weeks.""  During the 1990s, FHM dominated the men's market and was published in 27 countries, including Pakistan and India.  It claimed that its annual poll of the 100 Sexiest Women in the World ""helped propel the careers of many well-known actresses, musicians and models"".  The magazine industry has been particularly vulnerable to online competition, and ""lads' magazines"" have been struggling to hold on to their readers.  In the last 10 years, FHM's circulation has fallen from about 500,000 to below 100,000. In the last 12 months, rivals Nuts and Loaded have both closed their doors.  The publishers said: ""Men's media habits have continually moved towards mobile and social."" However, it did not specifically blame the online market for its closure.  It said that FHM and Zoo had a combined digital audience of more than five million."
321,"A British Medical Association report said patients should be particularly wary of tests which could be bought over the internet or via mail order.  And it warns ad hoc tests may do harm than good, either through false positive or inconsistent results.  The prostate cancer test and mammograms for women under 50 are two tests whose worth are questioned by the BMA.  An estimated £65 million was spent on private screening in the UK in 2004.  But while patients may pay for the initial screening, if a potential problem is discovered it is the NHS that picks up the bill for further tests, counselling and treatment.  The BMA says formal screening programmes, such as breast checks for women between 50 and 70, have been introduced because they have been proven to be of benefit in detecting disease.  But the BMA says there are numerous examples where screening is available without such strong evidence to support its use.  Research has shown for example, that mammograms in women under 50 may not detect small cancers, and that it involves a high chance of misleading results.  This can lead to further invasive tests and to surgery in many women whose cancers might never have progressed during their lifetime.  The use of the PSA test, which is provided on the NHS, is also questioned by the BMA, which says it ""cannot identify those who will die"" and warns the treatment of prostate cancer ""has side effects that can cause more problems than the disease"".  Two thirds of men with high PSA do not have prostate cancer, while some men with prostate cancer do not have high PSA.  The BMA adds that no evidence exists to show whether treating localised prostate cancer does more good than harm.  Concerns were also raised in the report about whole body computer tomography (CT) scans for people without any symptoms - which can cause false alarms and involve significant doses of radiation - and electrocardiograms (ECGs) for people without symptoms of heart disease.  The report says unregulated screening can put patients at risk because of a lack of evidence they are effective, no quality control, poor follow up and insufficient information before and afterwards.  It also says pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), now carried out on embryos to see if they carry an inherited disease.  Some are concerned it could be used to create 'designer babies' by selecting gender or eye or hair colour, but the BMA says, due to the difficulties involved, PGD is only to be used by couples at serious risk of having a child with a disease, and ""frivolous"" use is unlikely.  It adds there are concerns about the use of information on genetic tests on adults by insurance companies, and says the current moratorium should be used to consider if such information should be treated any differently from other medical data.  Dr Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA's Head of Science and Ethics, commented: ""There is no doubt that some specific screening tests have the potential to save lives but this does not mean that there are no associated risks.  ""We want the public to be extremely wary of unregulated screening.  ""People should be especially cautious about testing kits that can be bought through the Internet and mail order.  ""The BMA is also worried that even with the existing major programmes the information about the benefits and limitations may be insufficient for patients to make an informed choice based on the harms and benefits of taking part.""  Emma Taggart, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ""We know that mammograms are not as effective in women under 50, as breasts are dense and harder to image. Only women at a higher risk because of their family history are entitled to mammography, in the absence of any breast symptoms, before this age.""  Dr Chris Hiley, of the Prostate Cancer Charity, said: ""There are major uncertainties about the ability of the PSA test to identify correctly men who have prostate cancer and exclude, correctly, men who probably don't have cancer.  ""This is why the PSA test isn't available on the NHS in a screening programme and why we are urging the government to invest in research to find a better, more reliable test.""  Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation said the organisation did not support the indiscriminate use of exercise testing to screen patients with coronary heart disease. ""  I'm all for breast screening under 50. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago, I asked to go on the mammogram list, after my GP messing me about and a pointless visit to genetic medicine, I was refused. I don't blame women for attending private screenings. When my mother used to attend chemotherapy there was a girl of 16 there who had had a mastectomy and reconstruction, another girl of 24 and one aged 28, and still we're being told it isn't common in young women. Who is kidding who? If I had the money I would definitely pay.  Natalie, Scotland, UK  The system of medical checkups in Britain, including screening, is inadequate. Everyone should be given an annual general check-up on the NHS, covering eyesight, hearing, cancer screening, heart condition, blood pressure etc. This is what happens in Japan. I am sure regular check-ups would save the government in Britain a fortune, and make the nation healthier.   J. Riley, Japan  Yes, I recently had a CT heart scan, which can detect early signs of coronary heart disease (this would normally require invasive procedures). In my case the results were very good but it did occur to me at the time that regulating this kind of testing might be necessary - otherwise it becomes an extremely effective way of queue-jumping within the NHS and the cost of providing such tests to any and every patient who wanted them would be far more than the NHS could possibly afford. It's another example of a key dilemma facing the NHS and which is not being addressed how do you limit or ration health services if they are all free at the point of use? The NHS is part of the civilised society which Britain is but these issues must be considered, rather than ignored as this government has been doing, if the health service is going to survive in the face of dramatic (and costly) medical advances.   Tudor Lomas  My daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 34. She found the lump herself, by which time she had three tumours and half her lymph glands were affected. We have to find a more effective way of screening young women for this devastating disease.  Yvonne Osman, Newark, Nottinghamshire  The demand for private testing (for all kinds of things and as with health care generally) is driven by the reality that patients often have real concerns - that a test will definitively answer, quickly - that the NHS is unable or unwilling to address unless you are happy to wait for months on end, by which time the problem may be untreatable. It is not at all obvious that ""DIY"" tests done using labs or other forms of private medicine are any less reliable than tests done by the NHS. Unless and until the NHS can provide the service people want, it is entirely reasonable that people will seek alternative and supplementary ways to get health care when it is needed, rather than in 9 months. Doctors, politicians and the NHS need to face this reality and find ways to allow patients to make use of what is available outside and inside the NHS in a complementary way, rather than whining that such and such a treatment should be their monopoly.

322,"Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes has completed his takeover of Premier League newcomers QPR.  The 47-year-old has secured a 66% stake in the club, buying out previous majority shareholders Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone.  Fernandes will work alongside the Mittal Family, who have retained their 33% stake.  ""QPR is a raw diamond and hopefully I can contribute into turning it into a diamond,"" said Fernandes.  He will take the role of chairman of QPR Holdings Ltd and will be joined on the board by joint Tune Group owner Mr Kamarudin Bin Meranun, one of Malaysia's most successful business tycoons.  ""Everyone knows I've followed West Ham all my life but I've always had a soft spot for QPR,"" said Fernandes, who is also team principal of Formula 1's Team Lotus. ""Rangers were one of the first teams I watched as a child at Loftus Road.""  Amit Bhatia, who will resume his position as vice-chairman, told the club's official website: ""I'm very excited to welcome Tony to QPR and having spent considerable time with him, know that we share the same vision and values.  ""We have discussed in great detail how to restore pride at the club and I'm very pleased with the outcome of these discussions.  ""It was a very difficult decision to resign from the board when I did, so I'm thrilled to be back and would like to thank all those who supported me and my family and look forward to serving the club to the best of my abilities again.  ""Tony and I will work alongside each other to try and make this season as exciting and successful as possible. I love this club and this is a very happy day for me.""  Fernandes added: ""The opportunity to get involved with the club was mentioned to me by the previous owners and here I am.  ""I've always wanted to be involved in football and the appeal of a London club, like QPR, was too good an opportunity to turn down.""  QPR won promotion back to the Premier League by winning the Championship under manager Neil Warnock last season.  They kicked off their campaign back in the top flight with a 4-0 home defeat by Bolton last weekend but Fernandes has already given his backing to the former Sheffield United and Crystal Palace boss.  ""It's a momentous day,"" said Warnock. ""Everybody connected with QPR should be excited.""  Fernandes added: ""I have ambitions in the long term.  ""I could easily say we're going to win the Champions League and the Premier League but that's really not my style. I don't want to make big promises I can't guarantee.  ""I want the fans to be proud of what we're doing and be involved as much as we can.  ""The fans pay good money and are stakeholders, so whatever we do, I want the fans to be proud. We'll do it in style and with integrity.  ""I'm keen to create a good Academy, so that there's a constant supply of players. We're in a fantastic part of London and we should be bringing kids through.  ""The third aspect is to be a strong partner in the community and to make a difference in the community.  ""Of course, you don't go into anything in the sporting world and not want to be the best, but these things take time and I'd rather let the results speaks for themselves."""
323,"The Hutton Inquiry found he died as a result of a slit wrist in July 2003.  But the medics said the small amount of blood they saw around the body was inconsistent with the cut on his wrist being the cause of death.  They spoke to the inquiry and Thames Valley Police, who say the investigation will not be reopened.  The scientist killed himself after being named as the possible source of a BBC story.  The story, which claimed that the government had ""sexed-up"" a dossier on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, led to the weapons inspector being subjected to intense pressure.  The pair gave a press conference after renewed media interest was sparked by the article.  Fellow paramedic Dave Bartlett said: ""Everyone was surprised at the outcome [of the Hutton Inquiry].  ""I would have thought there would have been more blood over the body if someone had bled to death.""  He added that the pair's observations of the scene ""were inconsistent with the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry"".  ""We stress that is our personal opinion. We do not represent the views of any body or group.""  Explaining her belief that the wound on Dr Kelly's wrist did not cause his death, Ms Hunt said: ""There just wasn't a lot of blood.  ""When someone cuts an artery, whether accidentally or intentionally, the blood pumps everywhere.""  The pair are not the only ones to question the inquiry's findings.  A team of scientists calling themselves the Kelly Investigation Group also believe there would have been much more blood at the scene.  But Dr Bob Van Hegan, a consultant pathologist, disagrees with the paramedics' assessment.  He told Sky News that in addition to the wrist wound there were three further factors which could have contributed to the scientist's death.  Dr Van Hegan pointed out that Dr Kelly's coronary arteries were in a poor condition, he suffered from a vascular disease and he had taken an opiate drug.  Tom Mangold, a former BBC journalist and friend of Dr Kelly, said: ""The fact that the paramedics did not find sufficient blood does not mean that it was not spilt.  ""Although I am sure they are speaking in good faith there is no doubt in my mind, or anyone else connected with the case, that David committed suicide.""  In March Oxfordshire coroner Nicholas Gardiner decided not to reconvene the inquest into Dr Kelly's death after it was adjourned while Lord Hutton held his inquiry.  The inquiry, which concluded that the weapons expert committed suicide, was deemed to remove the need for a full inquest.  A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said on Sunday: ""[We] are fully satisfied with the outcome of the investigation into David Kelly's death. """
324,"Up to 35 people have died and 100 others have been injured after three trains were involved in a collision during morning rush hour in south London.  Two commuter trains carrying an estimated 1,300 passengers between them collided shortly after 0800 GMT at Clapham Junction - Europe's busiest railway junction.  A third empty train later ran into the wreckage killing some passengers who had survived the first crash.  Many passengers are still trapped as fire crews are cutting through the tangled carriages to reach them.  Emergency services have said the extent of the injuries mean some passengers have received operations at the scene.  At nearby St George's Hospital in Tooting staff are on emergency alert as coaches and ambulances wait to take those needing medical care to its new accident and emergency unit.  Passengers well enough to leave by foot, stood by the rail track and were described as ""visibly shocked and distressed"".  Many have been taken to a nearby school for first aid treatment.  Witnesses, unable to reach survivors because of the extent of the wreckage, have reported seeing appalling injuries.  They described how carriages were sent hurtling into the air before crashing back down again after the collision.  The accident took place when the 0718 from Basingstoke to Waterloo approached the junction.  Early reports indicate it was slowing for signals when the 0614 from Poole, travelling from Bournemouth due to track problems, ran into the back of it.  Experts have said this train would have been travelling at about 40mph.  Shortly afterwards an empty train leaving Clapham junction hit the wreckage.  British Rail has said initial reports indicate the crash was caused by signalling failures.  The Transport Secretary Paul Cannon is understood to be on his way to the scene of the tragedy."
325,"A controversial rail link from Heathrow's Terminal 5 through south west London has been shelved due to a lack of money, according to the BAA.  The £675m line would have connected the airport terminal to Reading, Guildford and London Waterloo stations.  BAA said its decision to withdraw the rail link application followed concerns raised over level crossings delays.  ""We have been unable to develop solutions which fully address these concerns,"" BAA said.  Richmond council had opposed the scheme due to increased congestion it said would occur at barriers at Barnes, Mortlake and North Sheen.  Heathrow's surface access director Allan Gregory said: ""We've listened to the concerns raised by local residents about the impact of Airtrack and worked hard to try and resolve issues including level crossings.  ""Despite our considerable efforts, including discussions with Network Rail and the local highway authorities, we have been unable to develop solutions which fully address these concerns.""  He added the project was also cancelled due to lack of funds.  ""We have considered alternative scheme options and how these might be funded but in the absence of securing additional funding in the current economic climate, Heathrow Airport is unable to justify meeting the full cost of the project,"" he said.  Richmond council is yet to comment on the cancellation of the scheme."
326,"Brownsea Island, in Poole Harbour, Dorset, where the first camp for 20 boys was held by Robert Baden-Powell in 1907, is the focus of celebrations.  Some 300 scouts from 160 countries have set up camp at the National Trust site.  Some 40,000 scouts and leaders from across the world are also at a 12-day jamboree near Chelmsford, in Essex.  The Hylands Park event, opened on Saturday by Prince William, is believed to be the biggest event in the history of the Scout Association.  At Brownsea Island, 300 scouts assembled for a ceremony at 0800 BST (0700 GMT).  Chief Scout Peter Duncan, a former Blue Peter presenter, signalled the start of scouting's second century by blowing the original kudu horn that Lord Baden-Powell blew to start the first camp.  He said: ""Our aim is to bring up the next generation of useful citizens with a wider outlook than before and thereby to develop goodwill and peace in the world with comradeship and co-operation.""  This would be ""in place of the prevailing rivalry between classes, creeds and countries which have done so much in the past to produce wars and unrest"".  The Dorset-based scouts led the world in renewing their scout promise to build a peaceful and tolerant society.  Some 400,000 scouts in the UK took part in hundreds of similar events.  Scouts around the globe also reaffirmed their scouting promise in ceremonies.  Events were held in places as far afield as Namibia and Ecuador while, in Bucharest, Romania, scouts formed a human chain around the parliament building.  There are now thought to be 28 million scouts worldwide.  Cardiff scout Jon Grimes, 19, said scouting was as relevant now as it was 100 years ago.  He said: ""When [Lord Baden-Powell] first ran the camp, he brought together different social classes from public schools and less fortunate backgrounds. It was about crossing the social divide and making friends.  ""Our camp this year will be about making friends between people from different cultures.""  Mariama Irele, 17, from Senegal, said of the Dorset event: ""Two days ago I arrived here on a boat with 300 strangers - now they are all my friends.  ""If young people around the world can repeat what has happened here, then we really can help build a more friendly world."""
327,"The scheme, which includes building a tunnel for the A303 near the ancient Wiltshire site, was estimated to cost £183m when it was announced in 2002.  But now the government says the project will cost around £470m  A detailed review of the tunnel plan, as well as other road proposals for the site, will now be carried out.  The tunnel scheme had been identified in a government study as the best option to divert traffic away from Stonehenge.  Alternatives included re-routing the A303 away from the historic stones.  A three-month public inquiry finished in May 2004 and the planning inspector's report was submitted to the government in January.  But the Department for Transport (DfT) said on Wednesday that a detailed survey of the tunnel site had revealed two factors which would make the scheme more complicated - and expensive.  The first was the presence of large quantities of soft chalk, and the second a high water table.  ""The increase in scheme costs represents a significant change to the basis on which the government originally decided to progress this scheme,"" roads minister Stephen Ladyman said.  ""Our recognition of the importance of Stonehenge as a World Heritage site remains unchanged, but given the scale of the cost increase, we have to re-examine whether the scheme still represents value for money.""  A DfT spokesman said the problems would not have surfaced in the original government study.  He added there was a possibility a further public inquiry could be called if the government opted for another scheme.  It had been hoped work would start by early 2006, but the DfT spokesman could give no indication about how long the review would take.  The government will also consider the implications of delaying the project while other A303 improvements are carried out.  Any delays in approving the road plan will have an impact on English Heritage's proposal for a £67m visitor centre at Stonehenge.  Those plans were backed by members of Salisbury District Council's northern area committee on Tuesday and will now go forward to a decisive planning meeting on 26 July."
328,"A decades-old proposal for a road route past Stonehenge is still the most popular locally, a councillor has said in a letter to Highways England.  A re-routing of the A303 between the Countess and Long Barrow roundabouts was suggested before a 2004 public enquiry, according to Ian West.  He said he believed ""more than 90% of local residents"" would choose this over the government's £2bn tunnel option.  Highways England said it was committed to considering suggested alternatives.  In it, the Liberal Democrat county councillor for Till and Wylye Valley said he wanted to present an alternative to the tunnel ""for serious consideration"".  The idea is for a surface-laid dual carriageway to the south of the single carriageway currently in use.  ""Over the last 23 years or so that I have represented this area on the council, this scheme has been suggested by many residents to me and I believe it has a great deal of local support and merit,"" he wrote.  Mr West also represents Wiltshire County Council on the Stonehenge World Heritage Site Steering Group.  Among the benefits he lists are that it is the cheapest option, has the shortest completion time and is not visible from Stonehenge.  But he did admit there could be a loss of archaeology with this route cutting across the World Heritage Site.  Chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, Andy Rhind-Tutt, is opposed to this road plan and said: ""Any further damage to arguably the most significant prehistoric landscape in the world must be prevented at all costs.""  He would rather see a major bypass of nearby Salisbury and removing the A303 altogether from the World Heritage Site.  Highways England said it was aiming to launch a public consultation early next year.  ""As we develop our proposals in compliance with the statutory processes, we will consult a variety of stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, road users and interested parties,"" a spokeswoman said.  In January the government awarded a £17.5m design contract for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) road tunnel near the ancient stones to ease congestion on the A303.  A similar tunnel scheme for the route, which links London and the South West, was dropped in 2007 because of the spiralling cost."
329,"Grade II listed Gravesend Town Pier, in Kent, was originally opened in 1834.  But the introduction of the railway at the turn of the century saw a decline in the number of vessels using the river and the pier fell into disrepair.  In 2002, Gravesham Borough Council began a restoration project funded by various grants, and on Thursday the pier will be officially reopened.  As well as walking along the pier, people will be able to dine at the new restaurant and bar.  When it was first built, many of the colonial settlers departed for their new lives from the pier, as did many of the crews involved in the early voyages of discovery."
330,"A cream tea is usually eaten as a mid-afternoon snack or when on holiday, as a stop-gap during that long break between the midday and evening meals. The essential ingredients of a cream tea are:  The jam and cream are piled atop the scone, which is then eaten slowly (with the hands rather than a knife and fork). Occasional sips of tea or coffee are taken to refresh the mouth between bites.  Each of the four ingredients contributes to the experience of eating a cream tea and can therefore reduce the pleasure if not prepared adequately.  For best results the scones should be freshly baked, to the point of them still being warm to the touch. Artificially maintaining the warmth (eg, by keeping them under lights or by reheating them) is unacceptable. The scones should be approximately 2.5"" in diameter and should be almost as tall as they are round. Do not worry if the scones look 'untidy' (ie, have begun to split or are lopsided). This is often an indication that the scones are home-made, or at least have been made by someone who regularly makes them at home.  There are, of course, many varieties of flour from which scones can be made although, generally speaking, the scones in a cream tea should be made from ordinary, white, self-raising flour. A good cream tea will include two healthy-sized scones, which should be split horizontally before applying the jam and cream.  The world of jams, conserves and preserves is indeed a complex one, and thus the scope of jams available for a cream tea can be enormous. For a good cream tea one should choose a jam that is fairly sweet, has a smooth texture and, ideally, is red (strawberry or raspberry are perfectly acceptable). Preserves tend to be too sweet, whereas jams such as gooseberry detract from the overall aesthetics of a cream tea due, in part, to being the wrong colour. The jam should be well-laden with fruit but should be cooked to the point where the fruit is soft and has begun to break down into smaller chunks, thus making it easier to spoon, spread and bite.  A good cream tea vendor will provide you with a generous dish of jam, preferably home-made. Do not accept poor substitutes, such as those nasty little plastic cuboids full of sticky stuff that are sold on trains and in poor-quality cafés in the name of jam. The jam should be applied to the scone in 'dollops' (ie, large spoonfuls). The size of the scone and jam may make it tricky to eat, but one should persist and pile on as much as is physically possible.  It is essential that the cream in a cream tea is clotted cream. Not 'double' cream or 'spooning' cream (whatever that is) but ultra-thick clotted cream, the sort that has to be forcibly removed from its container and will not drop off an upturned knife or spoon in a thousand years. When placed on the scone it will need to be squashed flat rather than spread, and should be generously applied, hence the unsuitability of other types of cream. As with the jam, cream should be piled high on the scone, bearing in mind only that which can comfortably fit into one's mouth.  Clotted cream is made by gently scalding milk over boiling water and allowing to cool overnight. This produces a thin, yellow-coloured crust on the top, pieces of which should still be visible even if it has been decanted from the original container into a smaller dish or pot. Once peculiar to the south-west counties of England, clotted cream is now available all over the world. The Cornish company Rhodda's, for example, provide an excellent service in this respect, while the Devonian company Torridge Vale take orders online for the full range of their products, including clotted cream.  To fully experience the pleasure of a cream tea it is important that the eater has black tea or coffee as a supplement. Why black? Adding milk to either of the two beverages tends to thicken their texture and can dull the palate, thus seriously reducing the pleasure of eating a cream tea.  The coffee should be freshly made, preferably from beans or ground-coffee rather than the freeze-dried granules. If tea is your choice then something light such as Earl Grey should suffice, although uninitiated black tea drinkers may wish to add a slice of lemon to their cup before consumption.  Expect to pay no more than £2.50 (at time of writing) for a cream tea that includes two scones, two 3"" diameter dishes filled with cream and jam, and a pot of tea or coffee (enough for two cups per person).  Contrary to popular belief, cream teas do not form a principal part of the staple diet in Devon and Cornwall (the two most south-westerly counties in England). It is here, however, that cream teas originated (although scones are originally of Scots origin) and are widely sold - in fact, as part of the tourism industry, they play a major role in keeping the economies of Devon and Cornwall afloat.  The best cream teas can be bought from small shops, cafés, or private front rooms or gardens, where they are likely to be freshly made on the premises. Cafés, restaurants or coffee bars on premises run by larger organisations (such as The National Trust) are unlikely to equal the cream teas available in small, family-run businesses - they are likely to be considerably more expensive and less generous in the quantities of jam and cream supplied - though there are naturally exceptions to this rule.  These are some of the places where the cream teas served are of the highest quality:  Also reputed to sell excellent cream teas are the Dorchester Hotel in London and Raffles in Singapore, although if expense is taken into account these may well have to be disqualified from this list.  The question refers to the two generally acceptable methods of preparing a cream tea. The Devonian method requires the eater to place the cream onto the half-scone first, allowing it to begin soaking into the scone, almost as a replacement for butter or margarine. The Cornish method is the reverse, with the jam being positioned first and the cream applied as a second topping.  The Devonian method has the advantage of reducing the inherent dryness of the scone, whereas the Cornish method of preparation has the sweet jam lusciously sandwiched between the two savouries. The choice of which method one chooses eventually comes down to personal taste and neither method is better or more acceptable than the other."
331,"In a small, noisy laboratory, tucked away in London's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, a tiny plant is growing.  It looks just like a very small parsley bush, but it is actually a very special little plant indeed.  Clean air has to be constantly circulated in the lab to protect it from any bacteria.  This precious specimen is the Anogramma ascensionis fern, commonly known as the parsley fern. Since the 1950s, botanists believed it to be extinct.  It is native to Ascension - an island in the South Atlantic, which is one of Britain's overseas territories. And a small project supported by Kew's overseas territories programme has rediscovered and rescued it - a timely success story, as this year has been dubbed International Year of Biodiversity.  Kew botanist Phil Lamden and local conservation officer Stedson Stroud found the plucky little plant clinging to a precarious existence on a mountainside in the harsh volcanic landscape.  ""We were down the back of Ascension's Green Mountain, which has very, very steep slopes. You have to be really careful because if you slip you're a goner,"" Mr Stroud recalled.  ""And we came across this beautiful little fern and immediately knew it was the lost Anogramma that had been extinct for the last 60 years.""  Ascension is covered by bleak, forbidding lava flows, and only 10 plant species are known to be truly ""endemic"" - found nowhere else in the world.  According to Kew scientists, goats that were released on to Ascension by Portuguese explorers in the 1500s, ate their way voraciously through the island's greenery for 350 years before any of the flora was even described to science.  The introduction of more invasive herbivores - rabbits, sheep, rats and donkeys, together with over 200 species of invasive plants, further squeezed out the island's original plant inhabitants. The rediscovery of Anogramma boosts to seven the number of surviving endemic plant species on the island.  Mr Stroud said that, in the excitement, both of the researchers ""forgot where they were"".  ""We were scrambling around, looking to see if there were more, and then we realised, we should really have safety ropes and stuff around us,"" he said.  There were more plants - four in total. But as far as the researchers knew, these were all that remained of Anogramma. So with the help of his colleague, Olivia Renshaw, Mr Stroud mounted a rather perilous effort to protect them.  ""We had to keep the plants alive - they were on a bare rock face and it was a really dry period, so Olivia and I went down twice a week carrying water and we set up a drip feed,"" said Stedson.  After a few weeks of tending the plants, the next part of their plan was even more risky. They had to get pieces of the ferns back to Kew so that more plants could be grown in the safety and sterility of the lab.  Stedson climbed down the ridge one again - this time to collect a few small cuttings of the spore-forming or reproductive parts of the plants.  Once harvested, the spores were vulnerable to drying and contamination, and the team had just 24 hours to transfer the precious cargo to the laboratory in Kew's Conservation Biotechnology Unit (CBU).  The samples were placed in a sterile container and rushed to the nearby airfield. From there, they were flown to a military airport in the UK, where a car was waiting to race them to Kew. Fortunately, the dust-like fern spores survived the journey intact.  Dr Viswambharan Sarasan is head of the CBU. He explained that their arrival was not the end of the challenge.  The spores had to be bleached to eliminate any bacteria, before the plants could be grown in culture.  ""That is the really risky part,"" he said. ""If you bleach them for too long, you could kill the spores, but if you don't treat them for long enough, there could be remaining bacteria that will grow in culture and kill them.""  And Dr Sarasan had only a 1p-piece-sized clipping of fern to work with - the smallest sample he had ever cultured from.  After another nervous period of waiting, he was relieved to discover that the process had left the spores intact and viable.  He and his colleague Katie Baker, a botany undergraduate student working at Kew, have now succeeded in growing 60 new Anogramma plants in culture - all from four tiny plants on a cliff face in Ascension.  The team hope eventually to restore Anogramma to its former wild habitats on Ascension's Green Mountain.  And Mr Stroud has even managed to grow some of the plants in a shade house on the island itself.  ""Each and every day, you're there, tending and looking, and hoping that something will happen,"" he said.  ""Then one day you see something and - watching the plants grow - you can't ask for anything more.""  Colin Clubbe, who leads the UK overseas territories programme at Kew, says that this rescue effort was a small but vital part of a much wider goal to protect native plants in Britain's overseas territories before they are lost forever.  Plants are such an important component of our lives,"" he said. ""And if we lose them, we lose them - extinction is forever.  He says that ""holding on to our natural environment"" could help us protect many of the plants we depend on.  ""We do exploit species - we're reliant on plant products. We use them as a source of genes and, in these extremely dry habitats, like Ascension, plants that are naturally adapted may hold some answers to things like plants' responses to climate change.""  This is actually the third extinct plant that Mr Stroud has rediscovered and, for him, it is an ongoing and very personal mission.  ""There's never a time that I'm not actually looking fort these species because, we say they're extinct, but I believe they are there,"" he said.  ""It's so satisfying, bringing a plant back from the brink of extinction.""  Hear more from the researchers on Science in Action on the BBC World Service on Friday 25 June."
332,"The government is to create a marine reserve almost as big as the UK in the Atlantic waters of Ascension Island.  Just over half of the protected area will be closed to fishing.  The fishery in the other half will be policed under a grant of £300,000 from the Louis Bacon Foundation, a charitable body.  It is the latest marine reserve to be declared around remote islands, which will increase marine conservation zones to about 2% of the ocean.  That remains a far cry from the 30% recommended by scientists to preserve species and expand fish stocks, but is much more than just a few years ago.  Governments have designated marine parks at Palau in the North Pacific, Easter Island and Pitcairn in the South Pacific, and New Zealand's Kermadec islands, in what has become a landmark year for ocean conservation.  The latest reserve at Ascension Island is said to hold some of the largest marlin in the world, one of the largest populations of green turtles, big colonies of tropical seabirds and the island's own unique frigate bird.  The reserve totals 234,291 sq km, slightly less than the size of the United Kingdom. It could be ready for formal designation as soon as 2017, once further data has been collected and analysed.  Dr Judith Brown, director of fisheries and marine conservation for Ascension Island government, said: ""The economic benefit from the fishery has provided much-needed income for the island.  ""This donation will help fund the enforcement to protect the closed area from illegal fishing.""  The Great British Oceans Coalition, which includes the Blue Marine Foundation and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, has been campaigning since 2014 for the designation of all or part of Ascension's waters.  Charles Clover, Blue Marine Foundation chairman, said: ""Ascension has been at the frontiers of science since Charles Darwin went there in the 19th Century, so it is entirely appropriate that it is now at the centre of a great scientific effort to design the Atlantic's largest marine reserve.""  An accident of colonial history has left the UK and France with huge potential to safeguard marine life around remote oceanic islands.  The Conservative party promised in its 2015 manifesto to create a ""blue belt"" of protected ocean round the UK's Overseas Territories.  The commitment was described by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith as ""the biggest conservation commitment by any government ever, pledging to protect an area of ocean three-and-a-half times the size of Britain""."
333,"""They had to kill him to prolong the life of apartheid,"" Nelson Mandela has said of Steve Biko.  Biko, a leader of the black consciousness movement in South Africa, died of major head injuries in South African police custody 25 years ago on 12 September 1977.  His contribution to the black fight for freedom from apartheid is often placed as second only to that of former President Nelson Mandela.  The anniversary of his death at the hands of the apartheid government's police is being marked across South Africa but is also the cause of a row over what he means for South Africa today  Steve Biko was never a member of the ANC and was active politically in the late 1960s and 1970s when the ANC was banned.  At the time young black activists moved away from the ANC's stress on non-racial ideology towards one that emphasised black empowerment and consciousness.  The arguments today in South Africa are about whether the ANC has taken on board his ideas and become an heir to his struggle for black rights or whether it is just appropriating his name when it suits them.  ANC supporters and those who claim to be the heirs of black consciousness argue over whether he would have joined the ANC had he lived and whether he would have supported the policies of the ANC government.  Born in the Eastern Cape of South Africa in December 1946, Steve Biko became a prominent anti-apartheid campaigner in the late 1960s while studying medicine.  A member of the non-racial National Union of South African Students, he decided that the union was too dominated by white liberals and founded the black South African Students' Organisation.  This stressed the need for black South Africans to take direct control of their own destinies.  Biko underlined the need for blacks to throw off mental as well as physical oppression but did not take the view that whites had no place in South Africa.  ""No race possesses the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and force, and I wish there is room for all of us in South Africa,"" he wrote then.  But on a pessimistic note he added: ""One wonders if the interests of blacks and whites in this country have not become so mutually exclusive as to remove the possibility of there being room for all of us"".  Steve Biko was viewed with alarm by the South African apartheid government and in 1973 he became a ""banned"" person - being restricted to his home town of King William's Town.  But he continued to work for the consciousness movement - leading to his arrest four times between 1975 and 1977.  The uprising against the white government's discriminatory education system, which started in the Soweto township on 16 June 1976, left hundreds of black people dead across South Africa and was a watershed in the development of internal opposition to the regime.  The student movements which led the protests were strongly influenced by Steve Biko.  His arrest and violent death at the hands of the police brought an abrupt end to his life and political career when he was still just 30 years old.  But it also brought ever greater international condemnation down on the South African Government, especially after the Justice Minister, Jimmy Kruger, said that Biko's death ""left me cold"".  Steve Biko became an icon second only to Nelson Mandela in the struggle against apartheid - recognised around the world as a symbol of resistance and sacrifice.  Internationally, this was emphasised by the Hollywood film, Cry Freedom, based on Biko's life.  After the election of the ANC Government in 1994, the Truth and reconciliation Commission was set up under Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Commission denied an amnesty to five policemen who admitted being involved in his death, though they have never been prosecuted.  In a tribute to him, Nelson Mandela wrote that just before his death, Steve Biko was arranging a secret meeting with ANC leaders and was killed to prevent him joining forces with them.  But the Azanian People's Organisation (Azapo), who still profess his black consciousness views, accuse the ANC of appropriating and corrupting his legacy.  ""Biko was not a neutral, apolitical and mythical icon that today he is scandalously made out to be in order to legitimise a black majority government that is weak,"", Azapo said, according to the French news agency AFP.  The black Sowetan newspaper takes the view that in South Africa today he would have argued that ""more emphasis should be placed on African self-reliance"".  So in South Africa the struggle continues for Steve Biko - but over his memory and legacy rather than against apartheid."
334,"Former champion jump jockey Richard Dunwoody is among the first volunteers for a research project examining the long-term effects of concussion on competitors in sports.  The study, Concussion in Sport, seeks to establish whether retired sportsmen and sportswomen have an increased incidence, or suffer an earlier onset, of neuro-degenerative disorders.  Dunwoody said: ""It was accepted we would suffer concussion but we gave little thought to the long-term effects of repetitive head injuries.""  The 52-year-old, who won the jockeys' title three times in a 17-year career ended in 1999 by a neck injury, added: ""This is an important research project, not only for racing, but for all sports.  ""It will be of great benefit to establish the facts regarding the effects of concussion and to be able to minimise risks for athletes in the future.""  The initial screening process will focus on retired jockeys.  Former champion jockeys Sir Tony McCoy, Peter Scudamore, John Francome and Stan Mellor, whose sport has the highest recorded rates of concussion, have also volunteered for screening.  Funding and support for the project, which will subsequently extend to all sports in which concussion is a recognised risk, has come from a range of sources, including the Injured Jockeys' Fund (IJF), racehorse owners Godolphin and American football's NFL, as well as private backers.  The International Concussion & Head Injury Research Foundation is the European wing of a collaboration between existing projects in Australia, Switzerland and the USA.  The ICHIRF was founded in 2014 by Dr Michael Turner, the former chief medical adviser to British Horseracing, who now holds that position with the Lawn Tennis Association. He will lead the research project.  Dr Turner said: ""For the first time, a state-of-the-art, controlled, multi-sport research study will look exclusively at concussion in European sportsmen and women, starting with a detailed study of over 200 former jockeys.  ""Through impartial, objective analysis of a significant pool of data, we will seek to establish whether there is any correlation between repeated concussion and long-term damage to the brain.""  The project also has the backing of former boxing world champion Barry McGuigan and England World Cup-winning rugby union coach Sir Clive Woodward.  Woodward said: ""Concussion has now become a major concern for all contact sports. Only through high-quality, independent research can we uncover the true facts surrounding this complicated condition.""  Retired sportsmen and women from other sports are being invited to enrol in the Concussion in Sport research, along with members of the public who have never had a concussion to contribute to the study as the 'control group'."
335,"Newport County caretaker boss Jimmy Dack has revealed he was offered the permanent manager's job but has opted to leave the League Two club instead.  Dack took over as caretaker when former manager Justin Edinburgh left for Gillingham in February.  ""The offer was there for me but I just felt that it was the right decision now for me to move,"" Dack said.  ""I've had four fantastic years seasons at this football club and I've given my all in every season I've been here.""  Former England captain Terry Butcher, ex-Mansfield boss Paul Cox, ex-Cheltenham manager Mark Yates and ex-England striker James Beattie are all understood to be in the running for the vacant post.  Dack would not be drawn on his reasons for stepping down but confirmed he does not have another job lined up to go to.  ""That's personal between me and Howard [director Greenhaf] and the football club,"" Dack said.  ""I decided that I've been here four years now, I've given everything for four years and... I just thought the time was right for me to pass the baton on and let someone else take the club on.  ""I've come in and I've probably dealt with more in three months than most managers do in three seasons... it's made me a better person and a stronger person for it.""  However when asked, the 42-year-old admitted he would like to be a manager elsewhere.  ""Yes, that could be a possibility, but I would be a number two elsewhere as well,"" Dack added.  Dack will oversee Saturday's final League Two game at home to Oxford United on Saturday 2 May and is aiming to leave on a high, saying ""I'm going to get three points"".  County were promoted from the Conference Premier in 2013 under the guidance of Edinburgh and Dack, an achievement Dack says was one of his proudest moments at the club.  But the Exiles look set for a third season in the division despite last weekend's 2-0 away win over York.  Although Newport are just three points outside the play-off places with one game remaining, seventh-placed Plymouth have a goal difference of plus-18 over the Welsh side."

338,"Over the last few decades, thanks to modern technology, the gates of a new world under the oceans have been flung open: a world that has preserved several chapters of human history in the forms of harbours, cities, temples, statues and shipwrecks.  But this is also a treasure trove that needs protecting. International seas are largely unregulated, meaning most underwater archaeological wealth can be retrieved and sold without any obstacle.  Award-winning archaeologist and broadcaster, Win Scutt, explores the archaeological wealth at the bottom of the sea & the anarchy that reigns when it comes to retrieving it.  Faced with a growing treasure hunting industry, the UNESCO has stepped in and is hoping to enforce a new convention to protect underwater cultural heritage by the end of the year.    Using special recording equipment, Win takes the listener underwater as he dives with a team of archaeologists excavating a shipwreck off the coast of Israel. As the mission progresses, he finds out what makes underwater archaeology unique, often challenging and sometimes very dangerous.     But the hostile environment is also what makes shipwrecks the best time capsules in archaeology, from which a great deal has been learnt. And with an estimated three million undiscovered shipwrecks, spread across the oceans, the journey of discovery has only just begun."
339,"A growing trend is for people to go online to get their daily dose of religion.  Religion is very important to most Indians, and the country is dotted with temples and religious shrines.  But increasingly, many young Indians are expressing their discontent with organised religion and are seeking alternatives.  Madras, in the deep south, has for years been a very conservative city. The city's Tamil majority population is deeply religious, and the city and its surrounding areas has some of the country's oldest and most magnificent temples.  But the city is also very modern and, economically, is one of the country's most progressive. It is at the centre of the growing automobile industry as is an important player in the cutting edge IT industry.  Advertising director Dinesh Damodaran is typical of many of the young executives in today's India.  He holds a high-pressure job in a demanding profession, working to tight deadlines.  With growing stress levels, young people like him are seeking a way to release their anxieties. But a visit to the neighbourhood temple is not what he has in mind.  ""A lot of religious practices have been handed down from generation to generation. A lot of it has lost its relevance. I think modern-day youth want something with a direct impact on what they do.""  In an India at the forefront of an IT revolution, it is not surprising that an online portal decided to cash in on this need for immediate salvation.  Mahesh Mohanan set up saranam.com, a website which sells religious services, in 1999.  For a fee ranging from $4 to $300, Indians can perform virtual complex religious ceremonies in any temple in the country.  ""People just log in, go through our services and place an order,"" says Mohanan.  ""We have a network of priests, we call them franchisees. They go out and perform the ceremony.""  Mr Mohanan hit upon the idea when he had to make a pilgrimage to several temples after he got married, and just found the experience too arduous.  ""Basically, people don't have time,"" he says.  ""It's much easier. They don't have to worry about things like parking, and everyone has an internet connection.""  But it is not just Hindus - people from other religions too are look for fresh approaches.  Many of India's Christians, for instance, are being swayed by the growing influence of evangelists.  The Apostolic Tabernacle church is located in one of Madras oldest neighbourhoods, Vadamalai. The church itself, however, is brand new - a low-rise building with a large, neon cross.  Inside hundreds of worshippers are gathered in a packed auditorium. The pastor, Reverend Sam Chelladurai, is one of they city's best-known preachers and was trained in the United States.  His congregation is mixed - men and women, affluent and working class, and predominantly young.  Reverend Chelladurai also has a popular television programme on God TV, an evangelist channel.  ""Today the world is ridden with all kinds of problems; young people are going through divorce, financial trouble, job and career related problems,"" he says.  ""It's a very competitive world, one that puts a lot of tension in them.  ""They come here and they begin to hear some hope. We use music for that purpose.""  As for stressed-out advertising executive Dinesh Damodaran, the answer lies in a meditation technique once popular among Buddhists.  ""I meditate using the Vipassana technique - it's very effective, it helps me handle the day-to-day pressure of work,"" he says.  ""You feel a lot more calm and are more productive at work.""  Vipassana is growing in popularity in India. Many institutions - both government and private sector - now offer courses for their employees.  India's booming economy is increasingly having an impact on how young urban Indians lead their lives.  And in a country with religious practices that date back centuries, some traditions are clearly having to adapt to changing needs."
340,"Old wounds were reopened this week when the failing health of the former Ugandan military leader Idi Amin became a hot topic for media outlets across Africa.  When reports that Mr Amin, who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, was in hospital in a coma first surfaced last Saturday, attention focused initially in Uganda on Mr Amin's state of health.  Radio Uganda, Monitor FM, and the Kampala-based, Muslim Voice of Africa radio ran the news near the top of every bulletin.  The paper quoted Mr Amin's ""favourite wife"", Nalongo Madina Amin, saying she had asked for Amin to be allowed to return to Uganda.  ""She said [Ugandan President] Museveni told her that Amin had abused Ugandans' human rights and so had to answer for his sins the moment he is brought back,"" the paper said.  ""Surely he should be allowed back home, so that if he is to die, he dies here,"" it reported her saying.  This question came to dominate Ugandan comment during the week: Should a very sick Mr Amin be permitted to come back to Uganda without facing trial for up to 400,000 deaths and disappearances during his rule?  The New Vision daily, which supports the government, headlined its editorial ""Amin's decision"".  ""Amin's case is complicated"", it said. ""He has a lot to answer for in the minds of millions... [But] Amin has a right to return home. At the same time, all Ugandans are subject to the law.""  The independent Monitor was unequivocal: ""Amin has a right to live in Uganda.""  ""Although his regime is associated with gross human rights abuses, Amin has not been convicted of any crime since he was toppled in 1979,"" the paper argued.  ""None of the governments that came after him has tried to extradite Amin to answer for his crimes... In the eyes of the law, the former dictator is still innocent until proven guilty!""  A commentary by Opiyo Oloya in New Vision speculated on where Mr Amin should be buried: ""His death can neither be accorded the resources of the state nor the sympathy of the public.""  ""The most the family should expect is to be allowed, at its own expenses, to bring the body for burial in Uganda. Many Ugandans killed by Amin never even got that much.""  Some Ugandan papers also tried to test public opinion.  The Monitor ran a survey, which concluded that ""Ugandans want former President Idi Amin back home.""  ""Ugandans also want the government to give him all the benefits of a former president. In case he dies, Ugandans said Amin should be accorded a state burial at the Heroes Ground at Kololo.""  But the lively and often bitter tone of the discussion board on the New Vision web site paints a more complex picture.  There are several dozen replies to the question, ""Should Amin return?"", with many contributors claiming first-hand experience of Mr Amin's brutality.  Another is convinced his father was killed by Mr Amin, but says proving it is difficult: ""I still have not seen the solid evidence that would sway an unbiased court.""  One contribution - ""No-one in this forum will convince me that I should forgive and forget about Amin's atrocities to my family"" - harvests several critical replies.  ""Anger and vengefulness... are NEGATIVE emotions, sapping up your nervous energy"", writes one.  Whilst another is sceptical about politicians in general: ""Show me one Ugandan president who has not killed massive amounts.""  ""Let's not get stuck in history, let's try to move on.""  BBC Monitoring, based in Caversham in southern England, selects and translates information from radio, television, press, news agencies and the Internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages."
341,"General Idi Amin has seized power from President Milton Obote, the man who led Uganda to independence in 1962.  The general led a military coup while the president was out of the country attending the Commonwealth conference in Singapore.  Ugandan troops have sealed off Entebbe airport and there are reports of tanks and soldiers on the streets of the capital, Kampala. The president's residence is said to have been surrounded and major road links have been blocked.  Dr Obote became the country's first prime minister in 1962 at the head of an uneasy coalition between his own Uganda People's Congress and the Kabaka Yekka or King's party representing the Baganda tribe from the largest and richest province of the country.  Sir Edward Mutesa, better known as ""King Freddie"", became president.  Four years later Obote ousted the king and revised the constitution to make himself president.  General Amin, for seven years heavyweight boxing champion of Uganda, spent most of his army career as a sergeant, but once Dr Obote became president was rapidly promoted to chief of the armed forces.  A broadcast on Uganda radio accused the Obote government of corruption and said that ministers and senior civil servants owned cars, fleets of buses and even aeroplanes.  The broadcast said the army believed President Obote's policies would lead to bloodshed, accusing him of giving preferential treatment to the Lango region in the north of the country.  Cheering crowds were reported in the streets of Kampala after the radio broadcast.  Dr Obote arrived at Nairobi airport in Kenya tonight and was taken immediately to a hotel where he is holding talks with the Kenyan vice president, Arap Moi and the attorney general and foreign minister."
342,"The Ugandan authorities have denied knowledge of the whereabouts of British-Israeli citizen Dora Bloch.  The 74-year-old grandmother disappeared three days ago, shortly after Israeli commandos rescued hostages detained by Palestinian hijackers at Uganda's Entebbe airport.  Mrs Bloch, a widow, was one of a group of non-Israeli passengers released on 2 July (Friday) from the Air France airbus hijacked in Athens five days earlier.  She was taken to Mulago General Hospital in Kampala because she had a piece of food stuck in her throat.  A British diplomat visited Mrs Bloch in hospital on Sunday evening after the Israeli swoop on Entebbe.  Two plain-clothed guards told the British official that she was about to be discharged to the Imperial Hotel in Kampala.  When he returned to the hospital an hour later with some food he was denied entry.  A statement from the Uganda Ministry of Health claims former doctor, Mrs Bloch, left hospital to re-join the other hostages before the Israeli raid and after that Uganda ceased to have responsibility for her. The UK Minister of State for the Foreign Office Ted Rowlands told the Commons that the Ugandan response was ""totally unacceptable"" and was a cause for ""grave concern"". In Kampala, the Ugandan police told the British High Commission yesterday that a search had found nothing. A formal complaint has been made to the Ugandan High Commissioner in London, Fredrick Isingoma. The British High Commissioner to Kampala, Mr James Hennessey, is waiting for a flight at Heathrow after cutting short a holiday in Britain. He hopes to meet President Idi Amin in the next couple of days. Mrs Bloch's son Ilan Hartuv - one of the rescued hostages - has spoken to the world's press from his home in Tel Aviv: ""We know that President Amin would not want to harm a sick old woman. We are throwing ourselves on his mercy."" Dora Bloch, who lives in Tel Aviv, had been on her way to her youngest son's wedding in New York."
343,"BBC director-general Greg Dyke has described the corporation as being ""hideously white"".  Mr Dyke did not say the corporation was racist but acknowledged that, like the Metropolitan Police, it had a problem with race relations.  He admitted the organisation's management structure was more than 98% white.  And he said it was unable to retain staff from ethnic minorities and questioned if they were made to feel welcome.  His comments were made during an interview broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland on Sunday.  Mr Dyke said: ""I think the BBC is hideously white.  ""The figures we have at the moment suggest that quite a lot of people from different ethnic backgrounds that we do attract to the BBC leave.  ""Maybe they don't feel at home, maybe they don't feel welcome.""  The director-general said a failure of the corporation's equal opportunities policies was most noticeable at the highest levels.  ""Our biggest problem is at management level. I had a management Christmas lunch and as I looked around I thought, 'We've got a real problem here',"" he said.  ""There were 80-odd people there and only one person who wasn't white.""  Mr Dyke insisted the BBC was committed to eradicating racism but voiced concerns that similar determination was missing among some elements of the police.  He said he realised the Metropolitan Police also had problems in this area.  ""I'm not at all sure that the Metropolitan Police at all sorts of levels actually does.""  'What are we going to do?'  He added that by 2003, 10% of the BBC's UK workforce and 4% of management would be from ethnic minority backgrounds.  Mr Dyke said: ""You can have all the equal opportunities policies you like, but if actually, the gateman doesn't let blacks through the gates, you've got a problem, haven't you?  ""I don't believe the BBC is like that, but we are not saying 'What are we going to do about this'.""  A spokeswoman for the Commission for Racial Equality said Mr Dyke had made similar statements before but welcomed his latest remarks.  She said: ""I welcome his acknowledgement that there's a problem and that he's trying to do something about it.  ""I think the key is getting the senior management to reflect the society we live in and that's a real challenge because once that situation is sorted then that will obviously have a beneficial knock-effect on the rest of the corporation.""  A BBC spokesman said in a statement: ""The BBC has a responsibility to reflect in its workforce and in its output the diverse nature of the community we serve, and indeed which funds it.  ""We want a BBC where diversity is seen as an asset, not an issue or a problem; a BBC which is open to talent from all communities and all cultures; a BBC which reflects the world in which we live today, not the world of yesterday."""
344,"I am not surprised that some readers of the Mail on Sunday, the Daily Mail and the Express are furious with the BBC. If I had paid my licence fee in good faith for an organisation which claims it is passionately committed to impartiality, only to discover – according to the Mail on Sunday – that the organisation itself has admitted it is biased, I would be pretty livid.  According to the Mail on Sunday, and other recent press reports, we have admitted that we are an organisation of trendy, left-leaning liberals who are anti-American, biased against Christianity, in favour of multiculturalism, and staffed by people who wouldn’t know an unbiased fact if it hit them on the head.  The Mail on Sunday based its story on a leak from what it called a “secret” meeting of BBC executives and governors, and claims that it was our former political editor, Andrew Marr himself, who confessed to the liberal bias of the organisation. His take was reinforced by Jeff Randall, who until recently was our business editor. “If they say it, then it must be true” was the thrust of the story.  Well I was one of the people who was at the ""secret"" meeting. and I have to say the reality was somewhat different to the way the press are reporting it.  For a start, this wasn’t a secret meeting... it was streamed live on the web. The meeting was made up of executives, governors and lots of non-BBC people like John Lloyd from the FT and Janet Daley from the Daily Telegraph. It was planned as a serious seminar to investigate and understand better the BBC’s commitment to impartiality in an age in which spin and opinion riddle much of the world’s journalism. The seminar was part of a bigger project kicked off by Michael Grade earlier this year to re-examine the underlying principles of impartiality in the digital age when boundaries between conventional broadcasting and the new platforms will increasingly disappear.  To keep us all on our toes, a rich variety of formats was used during the day. I was on a ""Hypothetical"" – where a panel of people in charge is given a series of mounting “real life” crises and asked how they would handle each of them. It was fun, occasionally illuminating, and often very challenging.  There was for example a heated debate about the whether or not a Muslim newsreader should be allowed to wear a headscarf. Jon Snow was all in favour. BBC Washington correspondent Justin Webb was vehemently against. I had deep reservations because I felt a scarf would be a distraction from the news but pointed out - in the interests of debate - that if we banned the headscarf, how would we justify that cross which I was sure I had once seen Fiona Bruce wearing. From this discussion emerged the wholly untrue newspaper story that the BBC had banned Fiona’s cross.  The point of the Hypothetical is to generate discussion, debate and ideas. The situations aren’t real; the discussions aren’t binding and they certainly don’t define BBC policy.  There was discussion of the BBC’s culture and some provocative points were made.  Jeff Randall made a few good jokes about the occasional examples of political correctness he found among some BBC colleagues. I remembered an incident about 15 years ago when a freelance reporter working for me on a programme about bullying in Feltham Young Offenders’ Institution asked me if it was acceptable to broadcast what they had discovered: that most of the bullies in Feltham at that time were black and most of the victims were white. Not only was it acceptable, I told the reporter, if he had evidence of this he had a duty to report it. And so we did.  Andrew Marr made some comments about BBC culture being more liberal than the rest of the country – points he makes in his book on journalism.  The main thing is, however, they were both giving their personal opinions. That is entirely their right and what they had been asked to do in the interests of discussion. I disagree with them. I found their claim of liberal bias unconvincing – based on anecdote and attitude rather than evidence.  The BBC employs more than 20,000 people across the UK. It is not a chattering class club of the kind depicted by the papers. It is a hugely varied organisation with many different cultures and a huge variety of opinions on every single issue among its staff. What does unite BBC staff however, is a deep commitment to BBC values and at the heart of those values is a commitment to impartiality.  When I first joined the BBC I asked a very experienced and subtle journalist what was meant by BBC impartiality. “It means we don’t take sides,” he said. “We don’t take sides either explicitly or implicitly. We test all opinion toughly but fairly and we let the audience make up their own minds.”  It’s a simple but absolutely correct definition which audiences see, hear and read in our output everyday. In the end, the personal views of our staff are not the point. The issue is that their views and opinions never stray on air.  And that’s where the broad audience comes in. What really counts is not what a group of BBC executives and VIPs think, or indeed what a few columnists believe. The important thing is whether or not our audiences think we are biased. And on that the evidence is robust.  Asked recently which of the four main broadcasters they would term ""trustworthy"", nearly two thirds - 60% - cited the BBC. In contrast, 26% said ITV, 16% mentioned Channel 4, and 14% Sky. (Mori, 2006)  That research is very cheering but it never allows us to rest on our laurels. Impartiality is not so much a fixed point as a process of open mindedness which should be the basis for everything we do in journalism.  Part of that open mindedness is being tested in exercises like the Hypothetical which ran at the impartiality seminar. No one has all the answers on any subject and debate and discussion are vital if we are to ensure that impartiality remains a living reality rather than an empty claim.  It’s a shame that the newspapers have made mischief with the seminar, but we won’t let this small storm put us off trying to get impartiality right."
345,"The tax arrangements of some public sector workers, including thousands at the BBC, have been criticised by MPs.  A Public Accounts Committee report says too many make their own arrangements to pay tax and national insurance, which could allow them to contribute less.  It said it was shocked to find the BBC had 25,000 such ""off payroll"" contracts - 13,000 for people who were on air.  The BBC said many of these were short-term contracts, but it was carrying out a detailed review of tax arrangements.  The Public Accounts Committee began its inquiries into off payroll contracts after it emerged earlier this year that the former head of the Student Loans Company was being paid via a company.  The arrangement - agreed by the tax authorities - potentially saved Ed Lester tens of thousands of pounds in tax.  It triggered a Treasury investigation across the government, which revealed that for more than 2,400 civil servants, tax was not being deducted when their wages were paid through PAYE.  Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge said: ""It was... shocking to find out that no fewer than 2,400 central government appointees were benefiting from off payroll arrangements.  ""Furthermore, the Treasury Review only covered civil servants. Tax avoidance in the public sector goes much wider.""  The Labour MP said avoiding tax and national insurance when paying public sector staff was ""almost always staggeringly inappropriate"".  She urged the public sector to ""show leadership in the fight against tax avoidance"" and should avoid the practice of using off-payroll arrangements for staff.  Jonathan Isaby, political director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, said many people would be ""astonished"" by the findings.  ""People are paying huge amounts of tax as it is for this country and they will feel even more angry if they think that those in public bodies, in the government, in local councils, and indeed their favourite TV presenters, are not paying their fair share as well,"" he said.  John Whiting, director of tax policy at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said some workers make their own tax arrangements for legitimate reasons.  ""If you are just an ordinary freelancer, which is very prevalent these days - anyone from a plumber to journalist - working here and there, working through a company, then it is a perfectly sensible way of organising your affairs,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.  ""What this report is targeting are people who are in what is often termed as 'disguised employment' - they're really an employee but they are putting the aura around them of 'No, I'm operating for a company'.""  This, he said, was the charge being made against some BBC staff and some public sector workers.  Mr Whiting said the authorities did have a ""notorious"" anti-avoidance provision to deal with this, named IR35, which has been operating since 2000, however the MPs' report pointed out that this provision was ""not that easy to apply"" and it was not being applied in as many situations as it could be.  ""Therefore, people have been getting away with it,"" he said.  The committee said it still lacked full information about the number of people employed by the National Health Service or in local government who were paid through private companies.  Members acknowledged that ultimately, whether or not staff with off payroll contracts were paying the right amount of tax was dependent on HM Revenue and Customs properly enforcing the rules.  But they also expressed concern that in recent years, HMRC had reduced its enforcement of legislation designed to eliminate tax avoidance through the use of intermediaries.  The BBC said that the actual number of people who were not paying tax at source was far smaller than the figures suggested.  In a statement, the broadcaster said: ""In many cases an individual - such as an occasional contributor to programmes - could be issued with a contract each time he or she is booked to appear.  ""We note the conclusions of the PAC report and will respond to the points raised as part of our detailed review of tax arrangements.""  David Smith, the BBC's head of employment tax, said the corporation was ""complying with the legislation that is there"".  Mr Smith said: ""It's not necessarily staff positions we are using the service company route for.  ""These are people who are freelance by their very nature, or certainly that's the way their services want to be provided to the BBC and the use of the service company is therefore there to protect the BBC from any unexpected exposure should HMRC disagree with that position."""
346,"Detectives investigating the murder of a five-year-old boy, whose severed torso was found in the River Thames, are meeting experts on ritualistic killings in South Africa.  They hope officers from the world's only Occult Crimes Unit will be able to help them identify the child and his killers.  Scotland Yard believes the killing could be Britain's first ""muti"" murder and a South African pathologist who carried out a post mortem said he found all the hallmarks of a ritualistic killing.  Commander Andy Baker and Detective Inspector Will O'Reilly will also brief Nelson Mandela about the murder, before the former South African leader makes a public appeal for information on Friday. The torso of the boy, who has been named 'Adam' by officers, was discovered near Tower Bridge in September of last year. During their trip the detectives will also meet academics, doctors and spiritualists in the hope of shedding new light on the investigation. Although the crime is unknown in Britain, South African police deal with a number of ritualistic murders every year. Scotland Yard also hopes ground-breaking forensic work will paint a biological picture of Adam, and reveal a specific country or region where he grew up. It believes Mr Mandela's intervention in the case could lead to new information. Commander Baker said: ""Mr Mandela is a highly respected, valued and revered man by people across the world and in particular by the African community. ""Scotland Yard is deeply grateful he has agreed to help with this inquiry, and we hope that his valuable contribution will encourage those with information to come forward."" Since the boy's body was discovered officers have been unable to find out who he is, despite extensive inquiries and the offer of a £50,000 reward. Adam, who is black, was found in just a pair of orange shorts. No-one fitting the boy's description has been reported missing in the UK or Europe. Police believe he was killed in London but that he originally came from Africa. They say the possibility he was killed by paedophiles is looking increasingly remote."
347,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A police sergeant seen in video footage hitting a woman during a G20 protest in London has been suspended, Scotland Yard has said. He is shown hitting the woman in the face with his hand and her leg with his baton after allegedly being sworn at. The sergeant works for the Territorial Support Group. The Independent Police Complaints Commission - probing Ian Tomlinson's death during the 1 April protests - is examining the 2 April incident. Opposition members of the London Assembly said the latest incident proved that Mr Tomlinson's assault was not an isolated incident. The woman who was seen being assaulted by the officer has been identified only as Nicky. Her sister Natalie Thompson, from Brighton, said: ""It has been stated that there are injuries but I'm not allowed to comment but I have been misquoted already."" The latest video footage featuring the female protester has been passed to the IPCC, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said. ""The officer has been identified and suspended pending further investigation. The officer works as a sergeant in the territorial support group,"" he added. Earlier, police said the actions of the officer featured in the footage raised ""immediate concerns"". ""Every officer is accountable under law, and fully aware of the scrutiny that their actions can be held open to,"" police said. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""The decision to use force is made by the individual police officer, and they must account for that."" The IPCC said it had been made aware of the latest footage by the Met and would now be looking at the ""best way to progress an investigation into the actions of the officer involved"". Jenny Jones, the Green Party's home affairs spokesman on the London Assembly, said she was worried officers may have hidden police uniform numbers to avoid identification. ""This new video footage confirms what many of us knew, that the assault on Ian Tomlinson was far from being an isolated incident during the G20 protest,"" she said. She added: ""Any attempt to avoid accountability by hiding police uniform numbers, destroying video images, or collusion over statements, must be severely dealt with."" A Met spokesman said the grey epaulette flashes on the officer should also have carried his sergeant stripes. David Howarth, the Liberal Democrat's justice spokesman, has called for a ""full-scale inquiry"". ""The fact that this video shows another example of an officer with his number obscured assaulting a member of the public indicates that there is a systematic problem here, not just a series of individual acts of misconduct,"" he said. ""The question is on my mind whether the police are using a some kind of 'designated hitter' system."" Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: ""It is no doubt a pressure cooker environment, however highly trained professionals are supposed to be better at defusing the situation."" Andrew Or, a photographer who was standing near the woman, said the strike across the face could have been accidental. ""I was actually quite shocked when I saw the movement of the arm and her being hit by the policeman,"" he said. ""He may not have meant to hit her, he may have been swinging his arm in a movement to say move back."" The video footage of the female protester emerged as the IPCC continues to investigate the death of Mr Tomlinson, who suffered a heart attack and died during the demonstrations on 1 April. The IPCC took up the case after footage taken by a New York fund manager showed Mr Tomlinson being pushed to the ground by a police officer shortly before his death. Days later more video footage aired on Channel 4 appeared to show the newspaper vendor being struck by an officer with a baton. The police officer seen in the video of Mr Tomlinson has been suspended by the Met. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said it was ""absolutely right"" any allegations regarding the new video footage should be thoroughly investigated.     "
348,"A married father-of-four faces a life behind bars for a series of horrific rapes and murders.  The Old Bailey jury found David Mulcahy guilty of the rape and murder of three women, seven more rapes and five counts of conspiracy to rape.  The court had heard that Mulcahy had ""hunted"" women in and around London with his childhood friend John Duffy - the so-called ""railway rapist"", now serving life imprisonment for rape and murder.  Mulcahy, a 41-year-old builder of Chalk Farm, north London, had planned a number of the attacks in the 1980s with his ""wicked soulmate"", the jury heard. As youths Duffy and Mulcahy used to go out shooting at people with air rifles. Their friendship continued after they both got married and used to go out together at weekends. Giving evidence in Mulcahy's trial, Duffy said: ""We would plan it quite meticulously. ""We would have balaclavas and knives. We used to call it hunting. We did it as a bit of a joke. A bit of a game."" In July 1984 the pair raped two girls on Hampstead Heath.  ""We were very excited we had two victims. We thought it was great really,"" said Duffy. He said the two men had laughed about the rapes afterwards while listening to Michael Jackson tapes. In 1985, the pair turned to murder. Alison Day, was just 19 years old when she was raped and strangled at Hackney Wick station, east London, in December 1985. The following April, schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer, 15, was attacked by the men as she went to the shops to buy sweets. She too was raped and strangled near her home in Horsley, Surrey.  A month later in May 1986, newly-married TV presenter Anne Lock, 29, was killed by Mulcahy - probably suffocated - as she returned to her home at Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire. John Duffy, 41, was jailed for life in 1988 for two of the murders but cleared of killing Anne Lock. He had attacked more than 20 women - most aged between 15 and 32 - at railway stations in and around London and became known as the ""railway rapist"". Mulcahy's part in the appalling crimes was only revealed by Duffy while in prison."
349,"An anti-poll tax rally in central London has erupted into the worst riots seen in the city for a century.  Forty-five police officers are among the 113 people injured as well as 20 police horses.  A total of 340 people have been arrested in the heart of London's West End, popular with musical and theatre goers, as cars have been overturned and set alight.  Four tube stations have been shut for safety reasons as police try to clear the streets, with much of central London now cordoned off.  Demonstrators have attacked police with bricks and cans.  Fire fighters attempting to extinguish the blazes have been hit with wood and stones.  Restaurants have been forced to close early by the violence which left shop windows smashed and many businesses with their contents looted.  The violence erupted just after 1600 BST following a peaceful march against the poll tax which saw up to 70,000 people take to the streets in protest at the new government levy.  A group of protesters involved in a sit-in at Whitehall, close to the Downing Street entrance, refused to move after requests from police and stewards.  As police arrested offenders, placards and cans were thrown from the crowd and the trouble spread to Charing Cross Road, Pall Mall, Regent Street and Covent Garden.  David Meynell, deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, in charge of the operation, said a peaceful march had been ""completely overshadowed by the actions of about 3,000 to 3,500 people in minority groups"".  He said they ""without any doubt at all"" had launched ""a ferocious and sustained attack on the police"".  The Home Secretary David Waddington is expected to make a statement to the House of Commons on the rioting tomorrow."
350,"A police officer has been stabbed to death during riots at the Broadwater Farm housing estate in Tottenham, North London.  Another policeman was shot and injured after a night of horrific violence between the police and hundreds of black and white youths.  By midnight 58 policemen and 24 other people have been taken to hospital.  It is the first time shots have been fired in a British riot.  The trouble was sparked off by the death of local resident Cynthia Jarrett who died of heart failure after four policemen burst into her home during a raid yesterday.  Earlier today, her family met to discuss her death with the police and demanded an inquiry. They made it clear they did not want any kind of public disorder.  Britain's first black council leader, Haringey's Bernie Grant, issued a statement condemning the police for the way they searched Mrs Jarrett's house.  The trouble began at 1845 GMT when police were called to Mount Pleasant, Willan Road and The Avenue.  They were pelted with bottles and petrol bombs, cars were overturned and set alight as were shops and other buildings. There was widespread looting.  About 500 police with shields, helmets and truncheons battled with rampaging youths threw bricks, bottles and cans from walkways within the estate as fires turned the night sky red.  At around 2145 GMT several gunshots were heard and one officer was shot and seriously wounded in Griffin Road.  Half an hour later a police officer was stabbed in the neck, suffering serious injuries. He died later in hospital.  Ten minutes after the stabbing another officer was shot and slightly wounded.  One senior officer said: ""This is not England. This is just madness. My men are being used as target practice.""  He said three of his men had sufferd burns but that the police did not have the resources to tackle the intense violence.  ""We haven't got the weapons to combat this kind of sickening violence.""  Teargas equipment is on site but senior commanders are reluctant to use it for fear of harming residents trapped inside their homes.  Police have blocked entrances to the estate to contain the riot.  The Tottenham riots come just a week after violence erupted in Brixton, south London following the accidental shooting of Cherry Groce."
351,"Riots have broken out on the streets of south London after a woman was shot and seriously injured in a house search.  Armed officers raided a house in Brixton early this morning looking for a man in connection with a robbery.  Crowds began to gather outside the district's police station when news broke the police had accidentally shot the man's mother, Cherry Groce, in her bed with apparently no warning.  Local people had already been very critical of police tactics in Brixton and a mood of tension exploded into violence as night fell.  Dozens of officers dressed in riot gear were injured as they were attacked by groups of mainly black youths with bricks and wooden stakes.  The rioters also set alight a barricade of cars across the Brixton Road with petrol bombs and some looted shops in nearby streets.  The suspected armed robber was not home when the police raided his address and Scotland Yard described the shooting of his mother as a ""tragic accident"".  One of Mrs Groce's daughters told the BBC everything happened very quickly.  ""It was a loud noise that made me run down the stairs - by the time I got down there were three police dogs, police rushing everywhere and one of them had a gun,"" she said.  Mrs Groce is being treated at St Thomas' Hospital in central London and her family say the mother-of-six may never walk again.  ""She is just in a state of shock - she cannot recall with any great accuracy because it all happened so fast,"" said her brother Tony Young.  A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said it did all it could to prevent mistakes like this, but it had to recognise the increased use of firearms by criminals made errors more likely."
352,"The six remaining hostages held by armed men in the cellar of a restaurant in Knightsbridge, London have been released unharmed after five days.  The crisis began on 28 September when nine staff of the Spaghetti House chain gathered to collect the week's takings amounting to almost £13,000.  Three men burst in and led the staff, all Italians, down into a small basement storeroom. One man managed to escape and alert the police who quickly cordoned off the area.  The gunmen held the rest in a storeroom, which was cramped and hot but well-stocked with tins of food. Over the next couple of days they released two hostages who became ill.  When it became clear the police would not give in to the gunmen's demands, the siege finally ended at 0340 GMT today and Franklin Davies, the gang's leader, shouted out: ""The hostages are coming out.""  Commander Christopher Payne ordered them out one by one and the Italians emerged tentatively before collapsing into the arms of police and being taken by ambulance to hospital for check-ups.  The Metropolitan Police had taken a hardline but tactful approach to the situation.  It had dismissed the group's claim it was part of a Black Panther splinter group, the Black Liberation Army, fighting against capitalism and the oppression of black people.  After referring to Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Sir Robert Mark, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had refused their demands for a plane and safe passage to Jamaica.  But the group had been given a radio, coffee and cigarettes in exchange for the release of two hostages who were unwell.  The freed hostages were Mario Roscelli, Enrico Mainini, Gino Barni, his brother Bruno, Renato Nasta and Giovanni Scrano.  Two of the gunmen who are West Indian - Wesley Dick, aged 24 and Anthony Gordon Munroe, aged 22 - have been charged at Cannon Row Police Station.  Davies, a 28-year-old Nigerian student, is being questioned at St George's Hospital.  Police had found him lying in the cellar with a gunshot wound and a .22 pistol beside him.  The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, has sent a telegram to Sir Robert praising him for the successful handling of the siege, the first of its kind in Britain.  At a news conference at Scotland Yard, Sir Robert paid tribute to the 400 officers who worked on securing the safe release of the hostages.  He also praised Italian Consul General Mario Manca whom he described as ""a sensitive, gallant and truly unselfish man"" and presented him with a mounted crest of the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Police.  At the height of the siege, Mr Manca had offered himself as a substitute for one of the hostages who was taken ill and then released.  Sir Robert also thanked the hostages and their relatives for their patience and fortitude, and also the press for their careful reporting of the situation."
353,"Hundreds of black and white youths have taken to the streets of Brixton, in south London attacking police, ransacking shops and burning cars after the death of a black man in police custody.  About 50 police officers in riot gear have formed a line across Brixton's main road to stifle pockets of trouble and prevent anyone entering the area - the scene of massive rioting in 1981 caused by racial tensions.  One report said two shots were fired as the centre of the demonstration moved into the area of the Ritzy cinema.  A police motor cyclist is reported to have been pulled from his machine by a crowd of at least 10 rioters.  Officers have sealed off a two-mile area around the centre of Brixton and both Brixton and neighbouring Stockwell tube stations have been closed.  A police helicopter has been despatched over the area.  Riots broke out after a peaceful picket of the police station - triggered by the death last week of Wayne Douglas, 26.  Police said Mr Douglas, who was being questioned about a burglary, collapsed at the local police station.  A post-mortem later revealed he had suffered from heart disease.  The protest about his death developed into a march down Brixton's main street.  A standoff ensued between the police and about 100 demonstrators triggering a backlash of violence.  Witnesses have reported hearing groups of black youths shouting ""Killers, killers"" at the police.  A spokeswoman for the police said seven civilian casualties had been reported so far, and police were also dealing with sporadic pockets of trouble in the area around Brixton town centre.  She said there had been unconfirmed reports of petrol bombs being ignited.  ""Officers were wearing protective clothing because we had reports of missiles being thrown,"" she added.  ""We gave them every opportunity to move off peacefully but they hadn't done so."""
354,"Last April's riots in Brixton, south London were caused by serious social and economic problems affecting Britain's inner cities, a report has said.  Lord Scarman's inquiry into what he called the worst outbreak of disorder in the UK this century also blamed ""racial disadvantage that is a fact of British life"".  The report criticised police and the government, but it said there was no excuse for the violence and praised officers for their conduct during the disorder.  The investigation found the rioting was caused by a spontaneous crowd reaction to police action - rightly or wrongly believed to be harassment of black people - and had not been planned.  On the night of 10 April two police officers were attempting to help a black youth who was bleeding from a suspected stab wound when they were approached by a hostile crowd.  The local community was already aggravated by ""Operation Swamp"" - during which large numbers of black youths were stopped and searched - and the confrontation quickly escalated.  Over 300 people were injured, 83 premises and 23 vehicles were damaged during the disturbances, at an estimated cost of £7.5m.  Lord Scarman called for a new emphasis on community policing and said more people from ethnic minorities should be recruited to the force.  He also advised the government to end racial disadvantage and tackle the disproportionately high level of unemployment among young black men - as high as 50% in Brixton.  The report has been widely welcomed by senior policeman and government ministers."
355,"At least 27 people have died after a fire at King's Cross station in central London.  The blaze reportedly began at about 1930 GMT in a machine room under a wooden escalator.  The escalator connected the Piccadilly line - one of five underground train routes which run through King's Cross - with the mainline station.  The fire started as the evening rush hour was trailing off but hundreds of commuters were still in the station which is London's busiest.  Many passengers were trapped underground as the escalator went up in flames.  More than 150 firefighters wearing breathing apparatus tackled the blaze and searched for survivors.  But they were not able to bring the main fire under control until approximately 2150 GMT.  It is feared the death toll could reach 40 after a search of the station has been completed.  A fire brigade spokesman, Brian Clark, said the scene in the concourse at the top of the burnt escalator was one of total devastation.  Mr Clark said tiles had come off walls and concrete was damaged because of the intense heat.  ""The situation there must have been very frightening and that is an understatement,"" he added.  About 20 people, including four members of the emergency services, have been taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation and burns.  The chairman of London Regional Transport (LRT), Sir Keith Bright, has described the blaze as a ""major disaster"".  Sir Keith said LRT was already implementing a policy to replace old wooden escalators with non-flammable metal ones.  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was ""horrified"" to hear of the ""dreadful"" fire and sent her deepest sympathies to the families of those who have been killed and injured.  The Railway Inspectorate has started an investigation into the blaze and will advise Transport Secretary Paul Channon about ordering an inquiry."
356,"Up to 35 people have died and 100 others have been injured after three trains were involved in a collision during morning rush hour in south London.  Two commuter trains carrying an estimated 1,300 passengers between them collided shortly after 0800 GMT at Clapham Junction - Europe's busiest railway junction.  A third empty train later ran into the wreckage killing some passengers who had survived the first crash.  Many passengers are still trapped as fire crews are cutting through the tangled carriages to reach them.  Emergency services have said the extent of the injuries mean some passengers have received operations at the scene.  At nearby St George's Hospital in Tooting staff are on emergency alert as coaches and ambulances wait to take those needing medical care to its new accident and emergency unit.  Passengers well enough to leave by foot, stood by the rail track and were described as ""visibly shocked and distressed"".  Many have been taken to a nearby school for first aid treatment.  Witnesses, unable to reach survivors because of the extent of the wreckage, have reported seeing appalling injuries.  They described how carriages were sent hurtling into the air before crashing back down again after the collision.  The accident took place when the 0718 from Basingstoke to Waterloo approached the junction.  Early reports indicate it was slowing for signals when the 0614 from Poole, travelling from Bournemouth due to track problems, ran into the back of it.  Experts have said this train would have been travelling at about 40mph.  Shortly afterwards an empty train leaving Clapham junction hit the wreckage.  British Rail has said initial reports indicate the crash was caused by signalling failures.  The Transport Secretary Paul Cannon is understood to be on his way to the scene of the tragedy."
357,"Scotland Yard has hailed the security operation surrounding the royal wedding as an ""amazing success"" despite 55 arrests around its security zone.  About half the arrests were for breach of the peace and a man was held for an alleged sex assault on a girl, aged 14.  Ten people carrying climbing gear and anti-monarchy placards were arrested near Charing Cross.  Other arrests were for drunk and disorderly, criminal damage, theft and over a suspected environmental protest.  Three people were held in the Covent Garden area over the alleged demonstration, police said.  Anti-terror powers were used to arrest one man who was seen taking suspicious photographs of transport hubs and security personnel in the Charing Cross area.  Three others were held over drug offences and four for allegedly carrying an offensive weapon.  Met Police Assistant Commissioner Lynne Owens said the success of the overall policing operation showed that the force could handle security for next year's Olympic Games.  She said her 5,000 officers should be ""immensely proud"" of their role in the ""happy and safe"" event.  She admitted to pre-event ""nerves"" and defended the decision to carry out a string of pre-event raids as ""entirely justified"".  An estimated one million people had gathered along the wedding route.  The police said that number was more than expected.  Officers questioned masked anti-monarchy protesters in Soho Square as a huge security operation took place around Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and The Mall.  Thousands of police officers created a ""ring of steel"" around the venues. Snipers took to rooftops and undercover officers mingled among the crowds  More than 90 people were banned from the area and up to 80 VIPs were granted personal protection.  Over the past few days police have arrested three people believed to be planning to behead effigies at the wedding.  They were detained by police in Brockley, south-east London, on Thursday night.  There were also several raids on squats across London, which drew criticism from one Labour backbencher.  John McDonnell accused police of ""disproportionate"" action, saying the raids appeared to be ""some form of pre-emptive strike"".  Elsewhere, anti-monarchy group Republic held a peaceful ""not the royal wedding"" street party in Red Lion Square, Holborn."
358,"Two men have been convicted of the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, 18 years after he was stabbed to death near a south London bus stop.  Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty by an Old Bailey jury after a trial based on forensic evidence.  Scientists found a tiny bloodstain on Dobson's jacket that could only have come from Mr Lawrence.  They also found a single hair belonging to the teenager on Norris's jeans. Sentencing will be on Wednesday.  In an exclusive interview with the BBC's Panorama, Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence said: ""I don't forgive the boys who killed Stephen. They don't think they have done anything wrong.  ""They took away Stephen's life and there is nothing in their behaviour or anything to show they regret what their actions have done and the pain it has caused us as a family.""  In a statement read by his lawyer outside the Old Bailey, Stephen's father, Neville Lawrence, said the convictions were a moment of joy and relief - but he could not rest until all of those who killed his son were brought to justice. He described the investigation and preparation of the case as ""faultless"".  He later told Channel 4 News: ""I'm praying that these people now realise that they've been found out and say to themselves, 'yes I did this awful deed, but I wasn't alone in that action that night and there are other people also guilty of what I've done' and name them.  ""I hope before the sentence is passed, they will talk and give the rest of these people that killed my son up.""  Duwayne Brooks, Stephen's best friend who had been with him on the night of the murder, tweeted: ""Some justice at last"" ""Some justice at last"".  Acting Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, acknowledged that police believe there were five people involved in the murder, but there are currently no ""live"" lines of inquiry.  ""If there was an opportunity to bring the other people who were involved in that night to justice, we would do so,"" she said.  The original failed investigation into the murder led to the Metropolitan Police being branded as institutionally racist.  Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he was stabbed to death near a bus stop in Eltham, south east London, in April 1993.  Police identified five men who were later named in a damning public inquiry as the ""prime suspects"".  By that time, there had already been a catalogue of police errors and two failed prosecutions, one brought by Stephen's parents.  But in a four-year-long cold case review, a fresh team of forensic scientists uncovered microscopic evidence linking two of the five men to the murder - evidence that the police had held all along.  The material - bloodstains, clothing fibres and a single hair belonging to the teenager - were recovered from the clothes of the suspects which had been seized in 1993.  Scientists recovered the material using advanced techniques which were not available to the original case scientists.  Dobson, 36, and Norris, 35, denied the murder. They said their clothing had been contaminated as police mixed up evidence over the years. Detectives spent months establishing the movements and handling of the exhibits since 1993 - and the jury were told that contamination was implausible.  Dobson was jailed for five years in 2010 for drugs trafficking. He is among a small number of men to have been tried twice for the same crime after the Court of Appeal quashed his 1996 acquittal for the murder.  Norris was convicted in 2002 of a separate allegation of racially threatening behaviour.  In mitigation, ahead of sentencing on Wednesday, counsel for Dobson said there was no evidence he had been the leader or prime motivator of the group that attacked the teenager.  Norris's counsel repeated his client's pleas of innocence - and revealed his client had been beaten up while on remand at Belmarsh prison, suffering a broken nose and four broken ribs.  Mr Justice Treacy discharged the jury and thanked them for their ""dedicated service"". He told them the public owed them a debt of gratitude.  As the defendants left the dock, Dobson told his family not to worry, and Norris waved to the gallery. Members of both men's families shouted back.  The Metropolitan Police's Acting Deputy Commissioner, who ordered the 2006 cold case review that led to the convictions, said the case had been extremely important for the Lawrence family, the force itself and society at large.  Cressida Dick added: ""It's a matter of huge regret to the Met that it has taken 18 years to get to this point.  ""It has been a unique case in policing. Firstly the horrible, horrible nature of the attack on the night, the time in which it has taken to bring anybody to justice, and the tireless campaigning of the Lawrences.  ""There is no comparable case. All homicide cases are terrible, but for us it is a very important case.  ""Most importantly, we wanted to be able to bring people to justice for the killing and try to give Doreen and Neville Lawrence and their family some sense of justice."""
359,"A man has been branded one of the most prolific and depraved sex attackers in British history after being convicted of a string of assaults.  Dubbed the Night Stalker, Delroy Grant, 53, raped and assaulted elderly victims over a period of 17 years in south London, Kent and Surrey.  Police said he was responsible for some of the most ""awful and disturbing crimes"" in Scotland Yard's history.  But they also apologised for missing chances which could have stopped him.  Police have linked Grant to incidents involving 203 separate surviving victims - but fear his actual number of victims could be as many as 600.  They think many of his victims may have died without reporting what had happened.  Det Ch Insp Colin Sutton, from the Metropolitan Police (Met), said: ""Officially we have looked at 203 offences but my guess would be you could probably double or treble that number.""  Commander Simon Foy, head of the Met's homicide and serious crime command, said: ""We are deeply sorry for the trauma suffered by all those victims and our failure to bring Grant to justice earlier.""  The police chief branded Grant a ""perverted, callous and violent individual"" who attacked some of the most vulnerable people in society.  Grant, of Honor Oak, south London, denied 29 charges, including burglary, rape and sexual assault, between 1992 and 2009, at Woolwich Crown Court.  The father of at least eight children and full-time carer for his estranged wife Jennifer, who has multiple sclerosis, targeted vulnerable elderly people in their homes at night.  The attacks took place in Warlingham, Shirley, Beckenham, Bromley, Addiscombe, Orpington and West Dulwich.  Officers had been hunting the Night Stalker, under the codename Operation Minstead, since 1998 when two rapes were linked to the same attacker.  Police missed a key chance to stop Grant in 1999 because of a paperwork blunder, it can now be revealed.  He was mistakenly ruled out of a police inquiry when the DNA of another suspect with a similar name was confused with his.  An officer also visited Grant's home but, after finding he was not there, never returned to speak to him.  An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation found that confusion by the Met over a suspect and a poor response to a burglary led to them failing to arrest the serial sex attacker sooner.  IPCC Commissioner for London Deborah Glass said: ""It is clear that a simple misunderstanding had horrific consequences.  ""Police missed the opportunity because confusion led to the wrong man's DNA being compared.""  Three Scotland Yard officers have faced misconduct proceedings over the botched investigation into one of Grant's burglaries.  Crown Prosecution Service lawyer Andrew Hadik said: ""The bravery of Grant's victims, who had to relive their ordeal while giving statements to the police and assisting with the investigation, was pivotal in bringing him to justice.  ""We thank them for their courage and for helping to put an end to Grant's crimes.""  Grant was found guilty of raping an 89-year-old woman after breaking into her home in 1992.  He also carried out the brutal sex attack of an 81-year-old woman in Warlingham in 1998.  The convictions bring to a close a massive manhunt that cost tens of millions of pounds and involved hundreds of officers.  Mr Foy added: ""He was also feared by many people living in the same communities and it is not too dramatic to say when he was caught, thousands of people in the South East were able to switch out their lights and go to sleep without the dreadful thought they would be preyed upon by Grant.""  Masked sexual predator Grant preyed on frail men and women in south London and violated them in their homes, sometimes for several hours.  Many of his victims were blind, deaf or had conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.  Grant targeted detached and semi-detached 1930s houses in leafy suburbs, often gaining entry by levering out double-glazed window units with a crowbar.  The hallmark of many of his offences was to cut telephone lines, remove light bulbs, then grab his victims with a gloved hand.  Grant woke terrified pensioners by shining a torch in their eyes before talking to them.  He then subjected his vulnerable victims to degrading and humiliating sexual assaults for a gratification described in court as impossible to understand.  The case was described at Woolwich Crown Court as one ""which keeps us all awake at night"".  Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting, said the series of attacks ""really is the stuff of nightmares"".  Among a string of ""almost laughable"" explanations at Woolwich was his claim that his ex-wife stored his semen in 1977, then waited 15 years to frame him for the crimes.  Grant also tried to blame his own son telling officers: ""Have you thought about my son Delroy Junior?""  The man went to great lengths to avoid capture as a nationwide manhunt to catch the Night Stalker rapist gathered pace, the court heard.  But a massive surveillance operation led to officers catching Grant red-handed as he drove home from a burglary in November 2009.  More than 70 undercover officers, supported by hidden cameras and a helicopter, staked out several streets in Shirley, near Croydon, in an ambitious operation after Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson called for a ""step change"" in the hunt.  Judge Peter Rook told Grant: ""You have been convicted of 29 offences of the utmost gravity.  ""I am not going to sentence you today because there are various matters that the barristers want to put before me.""  Victims may give evidence in court before the sentencing on Friday morning.  ""You should appreciate the sentence you receive will be what is called an indeterminate sentence,"" Judge Rook said  The term will be ""very long indeed"", he added."
360,"Roald Dahl's widow Felicity said the plaque was ""fantastic""    A blue plaque has been unveiled at the site of a favourite sweet shop of the young Roald Dahl, later immortalised in the author's memoirs. The old shop, now a Chinese takeaway, is in the Cardiff suburb of Llandaff, where the author was born and spent his early years in the 1920s. Dahl's widow Felicity said she was delighted his son Theo, who had flown from the US, had unveiled the plaque. ""It's fantastic. It's an enormous accolade to Roald,"" she said. The event is part of the fourth annual Roald Dahl Day celebrations. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The shop was located at 11 High Street, Llandaff, a short distance from Llandaff Cathedral, whose school Dahl attended from 1923 to 1925. The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory author later wrote an account in his autobiography Boy of ""The Great Mouse Plot"", describing how he and four accomplices got their revenge on the reputedly terrifying sweetshop owner, named Mrs Pratchett in his book, by slipping a dead mouse into a jar of gobstoppers. Danny, the Champion of the World ((1975) The plaque is the first in public view to recognise Dahl's life in Llandaff, and needed a visit from Mrs Dahl to assist in pinpointing the exact location of the shop. Children from local schools had been invited to the ceremony on Monday afternoon, which was followed by a re-enactment of ""The Great Mouse Plot"". Mrs Dahl said: ""What's so lovely is that he was born here, he went to school here and certainly sweets were a major part of his life and [were part of] possibly the most famous book of all, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. ""Theo, his son, was able to pull the curtain on the plaque and that, for me, was fantastic."" She added: ""I think he [Dahl] would have been amazed. He would have a smile on his face, he really would."" It is believed the owner of the sweetshop was a woman named Catherine Morgan, who would have been in her 70s at the time Dahl was a local schoolboy. The owner of the Chinese takeaway, Han Lau, said she had been aware of the connection with Dahl. ""I'm very proud the plaque is on and this shop is connected to Roald Dahl. It's an honour to be associated with such a great man,"" she said. ""I've got two boys - one is 20 and he read all the books and the other is seven and he's just finished his first Roald Dahl book."" Geoff Barton-Greenwood from the Llandaff Society said: ""We think [the blue plaque] is very significant because it is the first public recognition of Dahl's birth in Llandaff."" The former sweetshop has been a Chinese takeaway for many years Dahl's family lived at two houses in the area, one of which does have a commemorative plaque, but it is not visible from public areas, he explained. The society is looking to work with other organisations to create a Roald Dahl trail in Cardiff, starting at the Norwegian church in Cardiff Bay where Dahl's parents and their family worshipped and ending in Radyr in the north of the city, where the family lived at an art-nouveau mansion prior to his father's premature death. Dahl had five children with his first wife, the American actress Patricia Neal. They divorced in 1983 and he married Felicity d'Abreu Crosland.     "
361,"Both are world-famous authors who wrote some of their best known works in their sheds. But, as Roald Dahl's centenary is celebrated across the country, his widow reveals how heavily the children's author was influenced by Dylan Thomas's hut when building his own.  They are two writers famous for completely different types of writing.  Roald Dahl is celebrated for his imaginative children's stories, and Dylan Thomas for his poetry.  But it was Thomas who Dahl turned to for inspiration when he struggled to sit down and write in his house.  As a father of young children and with a bustling home, Cardiff-born Dahl initially found it hard to shut himself off and write.  Finding too many distractions in his house, he remembered fellow Welshman Dylan Thomas, who he called ""the greatest poet of our time"", had found a peaceful shed to write in close to home.  Thomas wrote works such as Under Milk Wood, Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night, Over Sir John's Hill and Poem on His Birthday inside his hut.  The writing shed was a former garage teetering on the edge of a cliff, with a view of the hills, the town of Laugharne and the Taf estuary below.  Dahl travelled to visit Thomas's hut in Carmarthenshire in the 1950s and, peering through the window, decided to make a replica of it to write in.  Surrounded by pictures (1), inspirational quotes and photos of family and friends (2), Dahl sat in a wing-back chair, which used to be his mother's, with a hole cut in it to relieve the pressure on an abscess he developed in his back (3).  While writing, he rested his legs on a battered suitcase, covering them with a sleeping bag when they got cold (4).  The writer used a cardboard tube with a piece of wood propped on top to work at, writing purely with pencils on yellow paper (8). He had a rubbish bin on one side for rejected pages (7), and a filing cabinet and books on the other (5).  His desk was a place for mementoes to inspire him, with objects such as the hip bone he kept after a hip replacement, and a ball made out of silver foil chocolate wrappers (9).  Although Dahl based the design of his hut on Thomas's shed, there was one major difference - the lack of natural light. He often kept his curtains drawn (10) to block out the outside world and was dependant on an angle-poise lamp (6) for light.  Dahl's widow Felicity said: ""He realised he had to have a space of his own in the garden away from the children and the noise and the general domesticity and he remembered that Dylan had felt the same.  ""And so he went down to Wales to look at Dylan's writing hut and, like everybody, fell in love with it.""  Built to the same proportions, with the same angled roof - the similarities could be a coincidence. But according to his widow it was built in a similar design by Dahl's builder friend Wally Saunders, who the BFG was based on.  ""He built it exactly to the same proportions as Dylan's hut, the same roof, one skin of brick,"" said Mrs Dahl. ""Of course Dylan's hut was a garage originally, whereas Roald had nothing, it was an empty space that he built on.""  While Dahl wrote in semi-darkness, Thomas had large windows (10) to take in the beautiful view from his writing shed perched on stilts on the cliff above the boathouse, where he lived in Laugharne.  Built as a garage by a previous owner, the poet filled his ""word-splashed hut"" with curled pictures of Byron, Walt Whitman, Louis MacNeice, WH Auden (1 and 2) as well as lists of alliterative words beside his pencil pot (8).  He sat on a simple chair (3) writing on paper (4), while throwing rejected pages onto the floor (5).  Like Dahl, he kept books on hand (6), mementoes to inspire him (9) and he also kept a supply of boiled sweets on his desk (7).  She said: ""It was so similar to Roald's hut. Everything was very simple, and Roald was like that, he didn't want rich yachts, he wanted a simple life, he was a countryman, again, like Dylan.""  Dahl wrote many of his books in the hut in the garden of his home Gipsy House in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, which was recently moved to the nearby Roald Dahl Story Museum at a cost of £500,000.  Describing his writing shed on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs programme in 1979, Dahl described the haven he had created.  He said: ""A little hut, curtains drawn so I don't see the squirrels up in the apple trees in the orchard. The light on, right away from the house, no vacuum cleaners, nothing.""  He added: ""When I am in this place it is my little nest. My womb."""
362,"Cardiff is set for a big adventure in 2016 to celebrate the centenary of one of its most famous sons, Roald Dahl.  Loved for children's books such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Dahl was born in Llandaff and spent his early schooldays there.  Arts organisations have come together for a series of events, including a Cardiff-wide City of the Unexpected, which will mark his legacy.  Roald Dahl 100 aims to build on the Dylan Thomas centenary success in 2014.  The Welsh government, National Theatre Wales, Wales Millennium Centre and Literature Wales have unveiled details of a programme of events.  The launch was at the Norwegian Church in Cardiff Bay, where Dahl was baptised.  Deputy Minister for Culture Ken Skates said: ""The Roald Dahl 100 celebrations in 2016 should be quite an adventure - in the words of Willy Wonka, 'Tremendous things are in store for you! Many wonderful surprises await you!'""  Dahl's grandson, Luke Kelly said: ""It is wonderful to hear today all the exciting plans both in Cardiff and throughout Wales for 2016. My grandfather would have been moved and delighted by the range of activity as am I.""  He and Dahl's widow Felicity were unveiling an official Roald Dahl 100 logo on a flag, which will fly from the Norwegian Church Arts Centre in 2016.  City of the Unexpected will be bring a mix of theatre, art and performance spectacles across Cardiff.  John McGrath, of NTW, which is joining forces to co-produce events with the WMC, said: ""Expect to see everyday places utterly transformed - seen through the eyes of Roald Dahl - and get ready to meet some of your favourite characters in the most unexpected ways"".  Literature Wales will bring a programme across Wales, which it says will be aimed at children and adults alike.  Chief executive Lleucu Siencyn said: ""Roald Dahl is loved by children and adults all over the world but not many know that he was born in Cardiff and is one of ours. In 2016 we plan to bring Dahl back to Wales.""  With his stories available in 59 languages and with more than 200 million book sales worldwide, the centenary celebrations will be on a global scale.  Highlights include Steven Spielberg's adaption of Roald Dahl's The BFG, to be released in cinemas next July."
363,"Roald Dahl spent two years at the Cathedral School in Llandaff, from the age of seven to nine. He then moved to St Peter's boarding school in Weston-super-Mare and suffered from homesickness. At the age of 13 he moved on to Repton School in Derbyshire.  Dahl's largely unhappy time at school is chronicled in Boy, the memoir of his childhood, in which he shares stories about his school days and his family."
364,"Two British military personnel have been injured after they ejected from their Harrier aircraft, which crashed on to a runway in Cyprus.  The crew members were on a training exercise at the Akrotiri base when it is thought the plane caught fire.  They were taken to hospital with ""non-life-threatening"" injuries, officials said. Next of kin have been informed.  The pair both serve with 20 squadron, a training squadron for navy and RAF crews, based at RAF Wittering, Cambs.  The incident occurred just after 1510 local time (1310 GMT).  A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""We can confirm that a Harrier aircraft crashed on to the runway at RAF Akrotiri during a training sortie.  ""The two personnel on board both ejected safely. An air crash investigation team is being assembled, and their investigation will determine the facts.  ""It would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the incident.""  The Ministry of Defence was unable to confirm whether the personnel were from the RAF or Royal Navy.  Akrotiri airfield opened in 1956 and is a permanent base for 84 Squadron, which performs search-and-rescue duties as well as supporting UN peacekeeping forces on the island.  The airfield is also used as a staging post for transport aircraft as well as for training.  The Red Arrows display team also practises at the base from late March each year.     "
365,"It is 200 years since Napoleon backtracked on his grand scheme to make his empire metric, but today the British remain unique in Europe by holding onto imperial weights and measures. With the UK's relationship with its neighbours under scrutiny, can it ever adopt the metric mindset?  It's an existential question that reveals much about how you make sense of the world. Is your ballpoint pen 6in long or 15cm?  Do you buy petrol by the gallon or the litre? Cheese by the ounce or the gram? And just how far is Dover from Calais - 21 miles or 34km?  Call it a proud expression of national identity or a stubborn refusal to engage with the neighbours. Either way, the persistent British preference for imperial over metric is particularly noteworthy at a time when its links with Europe are under greater scrutiny than ever.  Supporters of traditional weights and measures may have rejoiced in 2007 when the European Commission announced it was dropping its attempts to bring the UK into line with the rest of the EU.  But a looming anniversary is a reminder to decimal sceptics and enthusiasts alike that successful resistance to metrication is not always permanent.  In February 1812, some 17 years after France first went metric, Napoleon I introduced a system for small businesses called mesures usuelles - French for customary measurements. These were based on the old, pre-revolutionary system, in response to the unpopularity of the new decimal codes.  Only after Napoleon's departure did France go fully metric in 1840, using the law to enforce metrication.  But if the French eventually learned to think in units of 10, the UK, so far, has not. All the evidence suggests that, despite more than decade-and-a-half of goods being labelled in both metric and imperial, the British remain defiantly out of step with their counterparts across the channel.  In May 2011, a survey by supermarket chain Asda suggested 70% of customers found metric labelling confusing and wanted products labelled in imperial instead. In response, the company reverted to selling strawberries by the pound for the first time in over a decade.  According to social historian Joe Moran, author of Queuing For Beginners, the notion that imperial measures embody tradition and reassurance accounts for much of their appeal to the British.  ""It may also have something to do with the poetic, concrete names used in the old imperial system, particularly for coins - tanner, half a crown, guinea, etc, that just seem more familiar, friendly and native than metrics.""  Nonetheless, the legal requirement to display measurements for most products in both systems means many Britons have become adept at making the mental switch from ounces to grams and back again.  Nowhere is this duality more apparent than in relation to alcohol. Imperial measurements for spirits were phased out in 1988. Yet it remains illegal to sell beer and cider in any other units than pints.  It is a discrepancy that is reportedly mirrored in the illegal drugs market, with cannabis typically sold in ounces while cocaine is packaged in grams.  However, support for traditional measurements has gone beyond shoppers merely expressing a consumer preference.  In 2001, grocer Steve Thoburn became a cause celebre - if French terms are not inappropriate in this context - after being convicted for using scales showing only imperial weights. The Metric Martyr group's appeals against conviction were rejected all the way up to the House of Lords and, in February 2004, by the European Court of Human Rights.  Given the widespread association in the UK between the metric system and the European Union, it's tempting to view the battle simply as an expression of hostility towards political integration.  For one of the Metric Martyrs, Neil Herron, however, it was primarily concerned with how we understand the world around us.  ""It's about the language and vernacular with which we relate to each other,"" he says. ""Even with kids who have been educated in metric for the past 30 years, watching a football match talk about a penalty kick being 12 yards or the striker being six foot tall.  ""It goes to the core of who we are. If we are going to change we will do it organically, with the consent of the people. We won't have it imposed.""  Despite its popular identification with European bureaucracy, British attempts to scrap imperial measurements stretch back long before the UK came under the jurisdiction of Brussels.  In 1863 the House of Commons voted to mandate the metric system throughout the Empire, and in 1897 a parliamentary select committee recommended compulsory metrication within two years. In 1965 the Confederation of British Industry threw its weight behind the cause and the government set up the UK metrication board in 1969, four years before the UK joined the European Common Market.  Joining the community meant signing up to directives on standardised measurements, although the deadline for implementation was repeatedly pushed back. Since 1995, goods sold in Europe have had to be weighed or measured in metric, but the UK was temporarily allowed to continue using the imperial system.  This opt-out was due to expire in 2009, with only pints of beer, milk and cider and miles and supposed to survive beyond the cut-off. But ahead of the deadline, the European Commission admitted that persuading the British to accept grams over ounces was a lost cause, and shops could continue to label products in both systems.  To supporters of metric measures, it is a source of frustration that what they regard as a more logical mechanism has never achieved predominance.  Robin Paice of the UK Metric Association insists there is nothing intrinsically British about miles and pints and, for that matter, nothing inescapably foreign about kilometres and litres.  ""I don't believe things are hard-wired into the national mentality,"" he says.  ""The government has done very little to explain why it would be to the benefit of the UK to use the world's system. If people are asked to change the habits of a lifetime without explanation they are naturally quite reluctant. It's very much a failure of leadership.""  The UK may have the failure of Napoleon's armies to cross the channel to thank or blame for the resistance of imperial. But it is not the only country to fail to enthusiastically embrace metrication.  Japan's traditional shakkanho system was supposed to have been replaced by metric in 1924, but remained popular. It was forbidden in 1966 but is still used in agriculture.  And of course the US continues to weigh and measure in customary units, a system derived from imperial. According to Moran, the similarities between the two codes has served to reinforce UK Atlanticism.  ""Our residual attachment to imperial weights and measures is really to do with a resilient fact about our geo-political position: we are an island with one eye on America and an ambivalent attitude to the continent,"" he says.  ""In Britain the metric system has been associated with mainland Europe and also, since Napoleon, with European imperialism. The Americans used a set of weights and measures that was a variant on the imperial - and Americans coming over here in the war probably strengthened the sense that we had this in common.""  Switching between imperial and metric, the UK's approach to the issue may mirror the debate about its place in the world. But whichever way you measure it, the Channel isn't getting any larger or smaller."
366,"Europe's Industry Commissioner Gunter Verheugen said: ""There is not now and never will be any requirement to drop imperial measurements.""  The decision will not affect current law on metric measurements, but means imperial equivalents can be used too.  It follows years of wrangling between London and Brussels over metrication.  The commission has kept extending the deadline for the UK to complete the full transition to the metric system, with the most recent deadline being 2010.  This would have meant setting a deadline for ending the traditional delivery of pints of milk - and the sale of pints of beer in the UK's pubs.  Every one of the UK's road signs would have had to be changed from miles to kilometres - a move which opponents warned would be both expensive and confusing.  But it was the move, begun in 2000, to make the UK's market traders sell their produce in kilograms rather than pounds and ounces which caused outrage among traditionalists.  Sunderland grocer Steve Thoburn inspired the ""metric martyr"" movement with his defiance of the order to abandon the imperial measurements.  In 2001, he was convicted for having weighing scales which had only imperial measurements.  He died unexpectedly from a heart attack three years ago and, while the campaign he founded failed to win traders the right to ignore metric weights altogether, it has brought some results  Under the plans which have now been scrapped, even displaying the price of fruit and vegetables in pounds and ounces would have become grounds for a criminal prosecution.  Mr Verheugen's role includes trying to improve the EU's reputation in member states - and in an interview with the BBC, he admitted the EU had been making itself unpopular on an issue that did not really matter.  ""I organised a huge consultation, and the result was that industry told us there was no problem with the existing system.  ""I want to bring to an end a bitter, bitter battle that has lasted for decades and which in my view is completely pointless. We're bringing this battle to an end.""  However, campaigners on both sides of the debate have played down the significance of the announcement.  John Gardner, director of the pro-imperial British Weights and Measures Association, said: ""I've seen the European Commission statement and what they're saying is it will be allowed to use imperial measurements as additional information.  ""We think that the European Commission statement is extremely misleading. From our point of view the situation hasn't changed and the campaign goes on.  ""If a trader tries to conduct his business in just imperial measurements that will be illegal.""  The UK Metric Association said the statement does not mean that traders can go back to weighing and pricing in imperial measures, and it will be ""business as usual"".  Chairman Robin Paice said: ""While we regret this proposal to prolong the current muddle of metric and imperial units, it will only delay but not stop the inevitable move toward all-metric shopping.  ""Many of the big supermarkets have already stopped giving obsolete imperial prices, and we expect this trend to continue. There is no question of going backwards.""  Science and Innovation Minister Ian Pearson said he welcomed the commission's proposal.  ""This shows that the commission has listened to our views and recognised the strong arguments that we've made for maintaining dual metric and imperial labelling and the right for the UK to decide on the future use of pints and miles,"" he said.  ""We know how important this is to the British people and are grateful for the commission's support for this use to continue.""  The UK first mooted plans to convert to an all-metric system in 1965.  That led to generations of schoolchildren being promised that they would be the last ones who would have to learn two different systems."

368,"Henri Michel has quit as coach of Africa Cup of Nations co-hosts Equatorial Guinea just weeks before the start of the tournament.  He says he left in protest at interference from ""a third party"".  The country's sports minister has accused the Frenchman of ""sabotage"" but Michel said it was the authorities who were undermining him.  ""Working conditions were worse than before,"" Michel said in an interview broadcast by French radio.  ""I have stopped my work because there are more problems than before, political problems rather than sporting problems.""  It is the second time the French trainer has left the job because of meddling in team affairs.  He briefly left his post in October, before returning following the sacking of the then sports minister.  The most recent dispute centres on a player who was called up by officials rather than by the coach - and a dispute over the location of the team's pre-tournament training camp.  Michel wanted to go to Ghana whereas the government has arranged for the squad to travel to South Africa.  Michel is also angry about outstanding salary payments and the failure of the authorities to repay expenses.  Equatorial Guinea are in Group A at the Nations Cup, along with Zambia, Senegal and Libya.  Former coach Casto Nopo has been drafted in to take charge for the time being.  They are the lowest ranked team at the tournament and will be competing at the CAN for the first time in their history."
369,"Abbey National has joined the competition in the online banking market with the launch of its internet bank, Cahoot.  However, on a day marked by technical problems on the internet, hundreds of customers were prevented from opening accounts with the new bank.  Cahoot managing director Tim Murley said the website had crashed in the morning, after taking several 100 applications.  He said the situation had improved later in the day, but the problems had still not been resolved.  ""It's not gone as well as we had hoped,"" he said, adding that they had yet to uncover what had gone wrong.  He said Cahoot had had considerable interest, with applications peaking at about 1,000, but many people had not been able to get through.  The flotation of rival internet bank, Egg, was also marred by technical problems which prevented private investors from selling their shares in the crucial first hour of trade, although the problem was later cleared up.  To lure customers in an increasingly competitive market, Cahoot is offering credit cards and overdrafts interest-free for a year to its first 25,000 customers.  Over the longer term, the bank will offer credit cards and overdraft interest rates of between 7% and 11%.  The bank also plans to introduce other products, such as share dealing, savings and personal loans.  ""We don't make much money on the zero per cent [interest rates], but it is really about establishing yourself,"" said Tim Sawyer, Abbey National's marketing director.  ""We're expecting a good response, not a deluge,"" he said.  Cahoot, with only 56 staff, wants to attract customers by being the lowest-cost players in the market and plans to target the individual needs of customers.  ""We're going very much on individualised pricing offering rates based on credit history,"" Mr Sawyer said.  The bank aims to have 100,000 customers and 150,000 accounts by the end of this year.  By 2003, it hopes to have 5% of the online banking market, with 300,000 customers and 630,000 accounts.  Abbey National joins a slew of financial institutions which are launching online banks.  Egg, the online bank of UK life insurance and pensions group Prudential, starts trading on the stock exchange on Monday.  Halifax plans to launch Intelligent Finance in July and Lloyd's TSB's evolvebank.com will kick off toward the end of the year.  All the banks are offering low costs for customers and competitive rates through new technology, such as mobile phones with internet access.  Analysts say that banks are unlikely to make great profits from online banking, but say the competition among banks to cut costs will be passed onto the consumer."
370,"Mr Pamuk has been charged under Turkey's criminal code with insulting the country's national character.  The court case followed comments by Mr Pamuk about the deaths of one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds in Turkey.  The trial of Turkey's most internationally-acclaimed author is not due to start until mid-December.  But his case has caught the eye of European politicians weighing up Turkey's bid for membership of the European Union.  Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, the official responsible for shepherding Turkey through the membership process, did not mention Mr Pamuk's case when he made his opening statement.  They were clearly upset that the court had been brought under a new, supposedly more liberal penal code that the European Commission had pushed Turkey to introduce.  One MEP described the court case as ""most unfortunate"". Another stated that it was ""unacceptable"" that Turkey should join the EU while it still practised such restrictions on free speech.  Mr Rehn agreed that the court case was regrettable, while stressing that Turkey had made clear positive progress on human rights.  He said he had serious concerns over the interpretation of the penal code, and that the case was in contravention of the European convention on human rights."
371,"Celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of the Turkish Republic have been marred by a row between the country's fiercely secular establishment and the ruling Justice and Development Party, which has Islamist roots, over Islamic-style headscarves.  Headscarves - regarded by secularists as symbols of radical Islam - are banned in official ceremonies, schools, universities and public offices.  The row has its roots in the way in which the Turkish Republic was established.  The formation of a Turkish Republic from the ashes of the old Ottoman empire in 1923 marked the beginning of massive political and social change.  Mustafa Kemal, later known as Ataturk, or father of the Turks, drove through a programme of westernisation.  He introduced a democratic parliamentary system. Religious laws were abolished and secularism became the cornerstone of the modern Turkish state.  The Arabic script used by Turks for a thousand years was swept aside. Modern Turkey adopted the Latin alphabet and Western calendar.  Turks were forced to take surnames and women were given full political rights.  After Ataturk's death in 1938, Turkey's powerful military, which launched three coups between 1960 and 1980, took on the role of guardian of a united, secular Turkish state.  In 1997, it helped to ease Turkey's first Islamist Prime Minister from power.  Today, Kemalism, as it is known, is still the dominant ideology and Turkey, a member of Nato and candidate for European Union membership, is increasingly westward looking.  But Ataturk would have been distinctly uneasy about the rise of political Islam over the past decade.  The current governing party, Justice and Development, has Islamist roots.  It stresses its support for secular democracy and its pro-Western outlook.  It has used its first year in power to drive through a raft of democratisation reforms, which it hopes will ease the way to eventual EU membership.  But as the latest row over headscarves demonstrates, the party still has an uneasy relationship with Turkey's secular establishment, which continues to view it with suspicion."

373,"The new leader of the Roman Catholic church in Scotland is to be formally installed at two ceremonies in Glasgow.  The Most Rev Mario Conti, 67, was named by the Pope as the successor to the late Cardinal Thomas Winning, who died in June 2001.  The first part of his officially becoming the archbishop of Glasgow takes place at St Andrew's Cathedral with a ceremony known as Vespers, or Evening Prayer of the Church.  This is followed on Friday by the second stage, which will see him celebrate Mass in the cathedral for the first time as archbishop.  Thursday evening's proceedings will hear a reading of the Papal Bull (letter of appointment) by the Vatican ambassador to the UK, Archbishop Pablo Puente. This came from Pope John Paul II on 15 January and talks of Mario Conti's ""sincere heart"" and ""diligent proclaimation of the truth"". Senior politicians, including First Minister Jack McConnell and Scottish Secretary Helen Liddell will be present. The Rt Rev John Miller, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, will also be in the congregation. Representatives of other Christian traditions, the Jewish and Islamic faiths have been invited. During the ceremony, representatives of the different aspects of the life of the Archdiocese of Glasgow will come to the bishop's chair to greet him and offer their homage. Later, he will walk to the front of the sanctuary to meet and greet the representatives of public life and ecumenical guests.  On Friday, the new archbishop will enter the cathedral behind a procession of 200 clerics, cardinals, archbishops, bishops and priests. The Right Reverend Conti, who has been Bishop of Aberdeen since 1977, has spoken out on ethical matters such as abortion and cloning. Speaking after his appointment, he said his new job would give him a platform to make those views more widely known. He said his priority in his new job would be to meet the priests of the diocese to ""find out their concerns"". The Rt Rev Conti was born in Elgin, Moray, on 20 March 1934 and educated at St Marie's Convent and Springfield School."
374,"Put simply, it means all 10 outfield players in a team are comfortable in any position.  So if a defender wants to go on a mazy run towards goal, a midfielder will fill in for him at the back - and stay there.  It may sound crazy, but it was a style of play that made Holland the greatest side of the 1970s.  The brains behind it all was the Dutch captain and Ajax star player - Johan Cruyff.  With two fabulous feet and mesmeric ball skills, Cruyff was at the heart of everything Holland did - literally.  All 15 of their goals in the 1974 World Cup either started or ended with the captain.  Cruyff was mainly an attacking midfielder, but he popped up all over the pitch, conducting some of the most stunning football ever seen.  The Dutch passed the ball so well that opponents sometimes spent minutes without getting a touch!  Cruyff's finest moment was in a group match against Sweden.  With a defender niggling him on the touchline, Cruyff's left foot flicked the ball back behind his own right leg.  The hapless full-back tackled at thin air and ran off in the wrong direction - looking very confused!  The ""Cruyff turn"" was born. As far as we know, he's the only player to have a trick named after him!  Not for the first time, the hosts West Germany spoiled the party - by narrowly beating the Dutch in the final.  But Cruyff's place in history was assured - as the game's first true total footballer.  Verdict: A pioneer off the pitch and a magician on it. The best player never to win a World Cup."
375,"The flotation by Thai Beverages - maker of top-selling Chang beer - had been expected to be approved on Wednesday.  Officials said a formal decision had been delayed indefinitely so it could be made ""free of outside pressure"".  Anti-alcohol campaigners held another demonstration outside Bangkok's stock exchange on Wednesday.  Thai Beverages had hoped to raise more than $1bn (£530m) in the April flotation, which would have been the largest by value in Thailand's history and the first by a brewer.  The company, with more than 40 drink brands, is part of the empire of Thailand's wealthiest man Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi.  Chang beer was launched in 1995 and has overtaken rival Singha, with about 68% of market share.  Singha's maker Boon Rawd was said to be monitoring market reaction to the listing as it mulls a stock market flotation of its own.  The protesters have the backing of Chamlong Srimuang, a long-time mentor to Thailand's prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  They say alcohol is against Buddhism, Islam and traditional Thai culture and are vowing to continue their fight until the proposed listing is rejected.  ""Today is a day of relief for the Thai people concerned over an ill society already damaged by excessive alcohol consumption,"" the Anti-Alcohol network said in a statement.  Thai Beverages has not yet responded to the stock exchange announcement."
376,"Ancient map with China at centre goes on show in US  The huge map is being displayed at the Library of Congress in Washington A historic map of the world, with China at its centre, has gone on display at the Library of Congress in Washington. The map was created by Italian missionary Matteo Ricci in 1602. It is one of only two copies in existence in good condition. Because of its rarity and fragility - the map is printed on rice paper - the map has become known as the ""Impossible Black Tulip of Cartography"". This is the first time it has been on public show in north America. Ricci created the map at the request of Emperor Wanli who wanted it to help scholars and explorers. The map was purchased by the James Ford Bell Trust in October for $1m (£0.62m), making it the second-most expensive rare map ever sold. It denotes different parts of the world with annotations and pictures. The map had China at the centre of the world to underline its importance In the Americas, for example, several places are named including Chih-Li (Chile), Wa-ti-ma-la (Guatemala) and Ka-na-ta (Canada), and Florida is described as ""the Land of the Flowers"". Ford W Bell, a trustee for the James Ford Bell Trust, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper, that the map was ""one of the two best in terms of quality, as far as we know"". ""Ricci was a very smart missionary. He put China right at the centre of this new universe, this new globe, to underscore its importance,"" he said. ""Ricci, of course, was the first Westerner to enter Beijing. He was revered by the Chinese, and he was buried there."" The first secretary for cultural affairs at the Chinese embassy in the US, Ti Ban Zhang, said in a statement that the map represents ""the momentous first meeting of East and West"".     "

378,"Two people were arrested on the city's famous Place Bellecour square, in the first rioting in a major city centre.  The unrest, which followed more than two weeks of violence in France's poor suburbs, occurred hours before a curfew for minors came into force in Lyon.  In Paris, thousands of police are enforcing a ban on public meetings and the situation has remained calm.  The ban will remain in force until Sunday morning.  Police overnight said the situation across France was ""much calmer"" than on previous nights.  However, cars were set alight in the southern city of Toulouse and near St Etienne in the south-east.  A nursery school was torched in the southern town of Carpentras.  The trouble in Lyon began at about 1700 (1600 GMT) on Saturday on Place Bellecour, where a large number of riot police were on duty as a preventative measure.  Shoppers hurried away from the area and most shopkeepers closed their doors.  Officials in Lyon and 10 towns to the east of the city earlier announced a curfew to bar unaccompanied minors from the streets over the weekend between 2200 (2100 GMT) and 0600 (0500 GMT).  Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy blamed the Lyon violence on a ""demonstration by anarchists"" without elaborating.  The government has declared a state of emergency in Paris and more than 30 other areas to help quell the unrest.  The Paris ban on meetings, imposed under new emergency measures, prohibits ""all meetings likely to start or fuel disorder"".  It was announced after police reports of e-mails and text messages calling for ""violent acts"" in the city.  Mr Sarkozy has been inspecting police units in the capital, which have been beefed up by at least 2,000 extra officers from outside Paris.  The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Paris says there has been no sign of trouble there.  Either the messages were sheer bravado or the publicity given to them by police has scared potential participants away, our correspondent says.  Several hundred people rallied close to police headquarters in central Paris on Saturday to protest against alleged discrimination against youths of immigrant origin.  The country's unrest was triggered by the deaths in the run-down Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois of two youths, who were accidentally electrocuted at an electricity sub-station.  Locals said they were fleeing police but the police deny this."
379,"The Senate on Wednesday passed the extension - a day after a similar vote in the lower house.  The laws allow local authorities to impose curfews, conduct house-to-house searches and ban public gatherings.  The government says it still needs extra powers to end almost three weeks of civil unrest in France's poor, largely immigrant suburbs.  Almost 9,000 cars have been torched and about 3,000 people have been arrested.  Violence continued across France on Tuesday night but fewer cars were set on fire than during previous nights.  At the height of the violence, more than 1,400 vehicles were destroyed in a single night.  National Police Chief Michel Gaudin said on Tuesday the decline showed France was ""getting back to normal"".  But Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin told parliament ""we cannot accept that more than 200 cars burn each night"".  The violence has spread from Paris across French towns and cities, mostly in areas with a high concentration of ethnic minorities.  The riots began when two boys of North and West African origin were electrocuted in a Paris suburb after running from police, believing they were being chased.  French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy told the BBC that France has been going through a ""very deep crisis due to the crisis of immigration and the failure to integrate"".  He also pointed to the problem of racism.  Meanwhile, senior officials from President Jacques Chirac's centre-right party have suggested that polygamy is one factor in the riots, arguing children of polygamous families have less of a father figure and are more likely to live in overcrowded conditions.  Polygamy is illegal in France but until 1993, it was possible for immigrants to bring more than one wife from their home country to join them.  The lower house passed them by a 346-148 majority, and the Senate by 202-125.  The laws date from the Algerian war of independence in the 1950s.  The Socialist opposition attacked plans to extend the state of emergency, pointing out that few local governors had chosen to impose it.  Mr Chirac told cabinet ministers the extraordinary powers are ""strictly temporary and will only be applied where they are strictly necessary""."
380,"But this country now plays host to up to one million Iraqis who have fled the fighting in their country. Up to a million are in nearby Syria.  And there are big numbers in Iraq's other neighbours.  After nearly four years of war, they know they are not about to return home any time soon. The hidden crisis is beginning to demand the world's attention.  At Jordan's desert border crossing with Iraq, you see the Iraqi families arriving. Their belongings are piled high in GMCs, big American 10-seater vehicles that race across the badlands of western Iraq.  The Iraqis here will tell you of their relief after running the gauntlet of American soldiers, Iraqi insurgents, and the many bandits, that make this one of the most notorious journeys in the world. This wind-blown border post, many kilometres from the nearest town, is their safe haven, their refuge.  But Jordan is only letting in a fraction of the numbers it used to, perhaps only 10 or 15 car loads a day.  One old man I met just inside the border, who was arriving for medical treatment, was furious after a young nephew travelling with him was turned back by the Jordanians.  Almost all Iraqis you speak to have tales of how much more difficult it is to get into Jordan, compared with just a few months ago.  ""It's very difficult to get people outside of Iraq,"" explained Lutfi, an Iraqi doctor who has just managed to help his father join him in Jordan.  ""I used to come easily, there was no trouble at all. But lots of things have changed. Most of the Iraqis are forbidden to come unless they have something to prove they are studying, or for business or investment.""  The Jordanian government says there has been no formal change of policy; but a spokesman said there had been a tightening of regulations, particularly for security reasons.  It is a trend echoed around the region. Kasra Mofarah works in Jordan coordinating aid agencies operating in Iraq.  ""Most of the borders of the neighbouring countries of Iraq are very difficult to pass. They have administrative problems, passport issues, and they are not welcome any more,"" he explained.  ""Also the Western countries and the wealthier countries, they are becoming more and more difficult in terms of allocating any visa, or allowing any entrance. So it seems the doors are closing one by one around the world on the face of Iraqis.""  Even Iraqis who have managed to get one of the prized new G-series passports will be even luckier if they can get a visa.  Ashraf worked for an American company in Baghdad. He decided to get out after being kidnapped twice. Now he is stuck in Jordan:  ""I applied for a visa to go to the UK and also to the States. I got rejected many times by the British government and the American government.  ""They are pretty much responsible to help people like me and other friends that I know that worked with the military or the Americans.""  Lina and Nasir are two Iraqi doctors, who travelled to Britain to study in order to further their work on the mass graves where victims of Saddam's regime are buried.  The insurgents tracked them down and started sending terrifying threatening emails.  They were refused even an extension of their visas to stay in Britain, and were told not to bother even applying for political asylum.  ""It's unbelievable"", said Nasir. ""If you just send me home you send me to die. It's a matter of life or death, it's nothing in between.""  In fact the number of Iraqis being granted refugee status or political asylum in Britain has actually gone down since the invasion in 2003.  Only five Iraqis were granted refugee status by the British government in 2005.  It's the most graphic illustration of the world's neglect of this growing crisis.  Jordan itself has been widely praised for its tolerance in allowing in so many Iraqis. But Andrew Harper of the UN refugee agency warned that its a situation that cannot go on for ever.  ""You've got to ask how long this generosity can continue before saturation and before they start closing the borders,"" he warned. ""And once they are closed, what then happens to those refugees who are trying to escape from Iraq?""  In Jordan itself, most Iraqis are not allowed to work. Apart from a few rich businessman, they are slowly sinking into poverty.  Schooling is difficult, medical care even more precarious.  Dr Lutfi is trying to support the family he has managed to get out of Iraq. But he can't earn money here.  After being turned down for visas by Britain, the USA and Sweden, he decided there was no option but to return to Iraq and find work there."
381,"US Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration, Ellen Sauerbrey, says the refugee leaders in the camps are to blame.  Nepal is home to about 107,000 ethnic Nepalese expelled from Bhutan, which says they are illegal immigrants.  The US has said it will take 60,000 refugees, but says it can take more.  ""There is no question that severe intimidation began in the camps when the US made the offer of resettlement,"" Ms Sauerbrey told the BBC.  She was stopping over in the city of Calcutta on way to Delhi after a tour of Nepal and Bhutan.  Ms Sauerbrey blamed the refugee leaders in the camps in Nepal for the ""intimidation"".  ""For those who have spent 17 years trying to develop a programme to return to Bhutan, the idea that a large number of the refugees will come to the US reduces their political power,"" she said.  ""The refugees have also been fed on false rumours consistently.""  Leaders of these Bhutanese refugees have been trying to organise them for a long march back home through India.  But Delhi - which has very friendly relations with Thimphu - has deployed border guards and police to foil these marches.  Ms Sauerbrey says the government of Nepal must provide ""adequate security"" in the refugee camps, so that the UNHCR can provide resettlement information to the refugees and enlist those who voluntarily come forward to accept the offer.  ""If there's enough security in the camps, I am confident most of these refugees would take up the offer of resettlement in the US,"" Ms Sauerbrey said.  She said the US was interested in resettling 60,000 of the refugees over five years, but there was no limit and no quota to the US offer.  ""If more than 60,000 people are interested in being resettled and are referred to our programme by UNHCR, we will take those who qualify.  ""Most will qualify unless someone has a record of violence in the camp,"" she said.  ""We do not take these people because they are highly skilled or educated, we will take them for humanitarian considerations.""  Ms Sauerbrey, who visited Kathmandu and the refugee camps in eastern Nepal before travelling to Bhutan, said the process was formally launched after Nepalese officials went to the camps with her delegation and announced publicly the Nepalese government's support of the resettlement programmes.  She said 3,000 refugees have already applied informally for resettlement in the US.  ""Our goal this year is to interview about 15,000 and, in the next few years, we are expecting 20,000 to 25,000 per year, based on the interest generated amongst the refugees ,"" she added.  Ms Sauerbrey said the US government was keen to resolve the protracted refugee situation on humanitarian grounds.  ""If you have been to refugee camps, they are not nice places and these people have been in the camps for 17 years. That is a long, long time,"" she said.  Ms Sauerbrey said the resettlement could resolve a major part of the problem but there were people in the camps who were genuinely Bhutanese citizens and would very much like to come home.  ""The US and many other international communities do believe that Bhutan has a moral obligation with people who are genuinely Bhutanese citizens, to let them come home,"" she said.  Tens of thousand of Bhutanese of Nepali origin started fleeing the kingdom in the 1990s, complaining of persecution by the royal administration.  They found refuge in the camps in eastern Nepal, run by the UNHCR.  Several rounds of talks between Nepal and Bhutan have failed to resolve the issue.  But as Bhutan heads for its first national elections next year, the refugee leaders are pressing for the return of their people to the kingdom so that they can vote and regain their citizenship ."
382,"It is the fruit trucks that are most rigorously checked. They typically carry crates of watermelons.  Piled on top of each other, they are, the authorities say, a classic place for immigrants to hide.  One of the vehicles pulls up at Patras port. The customs officers spring into action, cutting holes in the cardboard boxes to check the fruit, clambering inside to prod and search and shining torches underneath. After a lengthy process, the truck is cleared to board the ferry.  Patras is one of Greece's biggest ports - known as the gateway to the west. Ships here leave to Italy and the vehicles on board often travel further still. It is a smugglers' hub into Europe - one of the continent's most vulnerable borders.  Suddenly there is a commotion in one corner. The guards have opened a vehicle containing gas canisters. And five men are found crammed inside. They sit, heads bowed. One says he is from Afghanistan.  The driver is taken to be questioned by the prosecutor. As officers enter the vehicle one of the migrants falls to the floor, crying uncontrollably. A guard hands him water and tries to calm him.  ""They will now be searched to see if they have relevant papers,"" says Evangelos Tasntzalos, the regional coastguard commander.  ""Then they'll be ordered to leave the country - and while they're waiting they won't be allowed in Patras or in the other big port, Igoumenitsa.""  More than 1,500 illegal immigrants were caught in Patras last year; every vehicle carrying them was impounded.  But while the port authorities are rigorous in their checks, plenty more migrants will attempt the journey. Over 80% of those entering the European Union now pass through Greece.  The typical route is in through the north-eastern corner of the country, across the Evros river from Turkey. They continue through Athens and down to Patras, in limbo until they pick what they hope is the right time to leave.  ""I'm scared I'll die at any time because it's so unsafe here,"" one Afghan says while cowering on a disused railway track. ""Nobody looks after us - there are no human rights in Greece. My dream is to go to England and I'll try every day to get there.""  The influx of new arrivals here has made immigration a hot social issue and a key theme in the upcoming election. In last month's inconclusive poll, the virulently anti-immigration Golden Dawn party swept into parliament for the first time in its history, promising to lay landmines along the border with Turkey.  The party rejects the neo-Nazi label, but its leader has been filmed making Hitler salutes, and he recently denied that gas chambers were used in the Holocaust and said the figure of six million Jews killed was ""an exaggeration"".  During a heated TV debate on Thursday a party spokesman hit a woman MP in the face, prompting a warrant for his arrest.  Last month, Golden Dawn members rounded on a derelict factory in Patras traditionally used by immigrants for shelter. They threw petrol bombs and set fire to parts of the building, clashing with riot police. The incident was sparked by the murder of a Greek man, allegedly by three Afghans.  The victim's cousin, Thymios Koklis, says the attitude of Greeks towards uncontrolled immigration is hardening.  ""We can't have so many immigrants - we don't even have jobs ourselves,"" he says. ""The migrants are in a way the victims of this whole story. But I would blame the government that doesn't do anything to protect Greeks from the hordes who come here. We're very scared of them - people say they would take the law into their own hands.""  Would he take the law into his own hands?  ""If the state can't protect me, someone has to. Myself and my family,"" he says.  Migrants now steer clear of the factory, leaving behind bits of soiled clothing and empty food packaging - the remnants of past lives strewn across the decaying floors. The building is a vast and squalid labyrinth - bits of Arabic graffiti are scrawled on the walls, shards of mangled concrete lie hanging and the place has a dank smell. There is even excrement in some corners.  Charities working on the issue say Greece must do more to help the vulnerable - and wake up to the bubbling tension.  ""I feel ashamed when I see how immigrants are treated,"" says Haralambos Tabakis from the immigration group Praksis. ""This is not the right way to deal with the issue. Greeks have been migrants for many years - we have left to Europe, the US, Australia: we would never have liked to be treated in this way. We know what migration is all about.""  As dusk falls, the hidden migrants of Patras come out to line the waterfront, gazing across the ocean to a new life. As they wait here, the immigration issue grows ever more volatile.  They came to this troubled country with dreams of Europe. But Greece is sinking further into crisis and the mood here is darkening - on all sides."
383,"What do you do if someone sees you shoot a man dead?  That was the dilemma facing Joel Smith, but in this case that someone was a seven-year-old girl.  His conclusion - shoot her too.  He then left the scene, probably stepping over Toni-Ann Byfield's young body, and has denied it ever since.  Now convicted by an Old Bailey jury of a double murder, BBC News looks at what sort of man could do such a thing?  Joel Smith, 33, was nothing special - although he liked to think otherwise.  He saw himself as a big time dealer yet rode a push bike and carried stolen credit cards.  Not the sign of a successful dealer, said investigating officer Det Supt Neil Basu.  In fact, his greatest success was to still be alive, he said.  Smith was born in London and spent almost 29 years there.  He knew little of his father and claimed to have been physically abused as a baby.  He spent his teenage years living at 862B Harrow Road in Kensal Green with his mother, coincidentally just doors away from the house where he would later murder the Byfields.  By 17, he had committed his first offence, a robbery.  This was to be the start of a criminal career that would see him notch up 34 convictions from drugs and firearms offences to violence and robberies.  On the streets, he became known as Cocaine or Kane, and was part of a notorious Harlesden gang, the Mus Love Crew.  Beneath his surly and muscular physique, Smith was a volatile, arrogant man but with an intelligence that police described as far greater than the average Trident gunman.  He was a big talker with an extremely short fuse - always trying to talk his way out of trouble, and sometimes slipping up and talking himself into it.  Occasionally he would work as a supervisor on building sites, but his convictions often led to spells in prison.  His latest was a three-year sentence for several offences including slashing his mother's boyfriend's throat.  Prison though did not seem to deter the drug dealer from taking a significantly more dangerous path towards robbing and shooting other dealers.  It was this that led him to knock on Bertram Byfield's door on 13 September 2003 with a ruse of wanting to buy cannabis.  Mr Basu has never believed Smith had met Byfield before that fateful day.  But Byfield's notoriety as a middle-tier drug dealer would have made it almost inconceivable that Smith would not have known of him, he said.  Byfield let him in and the events that followed remain unclear.  What is known is that Byfield was shot three times and appeared to have tried to defend himself with a bike.  Meanwhile Toni-Ann, who had always thought of Byfield as her father, had been getting ready for bed.  She entered the room but tried to run away when she saw what was happening. Smith pulled the trigger and shot her once in the back.  Now the judge must decide the price of this bungle which cost the life of an entirely innocent seven-year-old child."
384,"A man has been convicted of murdering a seven-year-old, who was shot in the back at her father's home in north-west London. Who was the man who pulled the trigger?  Crack dealers are seen by most criminals as the lowest of the low.  Joel Smith was one notch lower - a man not only prepared to push the highly addictive drug and to rob and shoot other dealers - but also to kill a seven-year-old girl who witnessed him killing the man she knew as her father.  Bertram Byfield - who DNA tests would posthumously prove was actually not related to her - had taken her to Brent Cross shopping centre to buy a uniform as she was starting at a new school the following Monday.  Afterwards they had visited a friend, Shelley (not her real name), who said Toni-Ann had not stopped talking about her school, as she was so excited at the thought of making new friends.  They left Shelley's home at 11pm and returned to Byfield's accommodation in an ex-offenders' hostel in Kensal Green, north-west London.  An hour later, as Toni-Ann was getting ready for bed, Smith knocked on the door on the pretext of buying some cannabis from Mr Byfield, who was known as Tony or by the street name Blacka.  Mr Byfield let him in but Smith had not come to buy drugs - he later told a cellmate he had been paid £25,000 to assassinate Blacka.  Smith was led him into the living room and when he pulled a 9mm semi-automatic out of his pocket Mr Byfield made a grab for a bicycle, which was propped up against the wall.  He probably meant to throw it as his assailant but Smith shot him three times and his body was later found entangled with the bicycle frame.  Toni-Ann, who was getting ready for bed, had wandered into the room and when Smith saw her he panicked, knowing she might be able to identify him.  As she screamed and turned to flee he shot her in the back. It was a single fatal shot.  Smith would have had to step over her body to leave the flat.  A neighbour heard the bangs but did not instantly recognise them as gunshots so Smith got away without being seen by any eyewitnesses.  But he would not escape justice forever.  Toni-Ann's mother, Roselyn Richards, said: ""I will never understand Joel Smith. A man who can shoot a seven-year-old girl in the back does not deserve to rejoin society. He has shown no remorse, maintaining his innocence in spite of the overwhelming evidence against him."""
385,"The ""bright, lively"" seven-year-old looked forward to her weekend visits to his north-west London home.  It was on one of those visits, in September 2003, that she was shot dead, along with Mr Byfield, by a crack dealer who had been paid to kill her father.  Posthumous DNA tests showed Mr Byfield, 41, and Toni-Ann were not actually related.  However, they had believed they were father and daughter, and she had been allowed to visit him despite his criminal past which had seen him jailed for dealing in crack cocaine in 1997.  It was a decision made by social workers at Birmingham City Council in whose care Toni-Ann had been placed a few months after arriving from Jamaica in June 2000.  The decision to allow the visits prompted an outcry after her death. An independent review of Toni-Ann's care criticised Birmingham social services, the Immigration Service and the Child and Family Courts Advisory and Support Service.  Following the review in 2004, Birmingham City Council apologised for its ""serious shortcomings and mistakes"".  Peter Hay, strategic director of social care and health at the council, said: ""We were too narrow in our focus.  ""Bertram Byfield was honest about his convictions and prison sentence, but there was a whole element to his life we did not assess properly.""  As well as serving time in prison Mr Byfield, who was also known as Tony or Blacka, is believed to have been affiliated to a Jamaican drugs cartel.  He had survived an attempt on his life in 2002 when he was shot six times.  After the killing of Mr Byfield and Toni-Ann, Interpol traced the girl's mother Roselyn Richards in Jamaica.  She has also criticised the care her daughter was given, saying after the 2004 review: ""Birmingham social services should have known where she was and taken appropriate action to ensure she was safe.""  Mr Hay told BBC News that Birmingham's social care and health directorate had made improvements in child protection practice immediately after Toni-Ann's death.  ""We know there were some shortfalls in the system from some agencies, however, this was not a case of neglect or abuse, but of murder.  ""Two years ago we committed ourselves to improving the way we work and Toni-Ann is also entitled to justice through the conviction of the person who shot her.""  Mr Byfield and Toni-Ann were buried together in Handsworth, Birmingham, in October 2003 following a funeral service attended by 200 people."
386,"Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that the campaign against the M11 extension contributed to a 100% increase in costs.  The Newbury bypass - the scene of Britain's most notorious road protest - was 50% over budget.  Protesters are warning of a similar campaign against airport expansion.  They say the projects ran over budget because of their action, but a spokesman for the Highways Agency said the protesters were only one factor that caused budgets to overrun.  During the M11 campaign protesters barricaded themselves inside houses in east London, which were later bulldozed.  In Newbury they dug tunnels and took to the trees.  The road cost in excess of £100m and took 34 months to complete. It was opened in November 1998.  In total more than 1,000 people were arrested."
387,"Six major environmental organisations today added their support to the growing anti-bypass campaign in Newbury, Berkshire.  Friends of the Earth, the Council for British Archaeology, Greenpeace UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Wildlife Trusts and the World Wide Fund for Nature all voiced disapproval of the new road scheme.  In a joint statement they said that a solution to the serious traffic problem was needed but that ""the proposed bypass route is not the answer"".  It said: ""Traffic on the A34 in Newbury will be back to the intolerable levels of today within five to 10 years of the bypass opening.""  Yet supporters of the scheme say the new road will provide essential relief to the congested town centre.  Contractors began work in earnest on the project last week but have since suffered numerous delays and setbacks.  Clearance has been hampered by well-organised activists employing effective disruption tactics.  Protesters have built tunnels and tree houses and are using themselves as human shields to prevent security men and diggers from moving in.  The ensuing conflict over the future of the prime countryside has become known as the 'Third Battle of Newbury' after the two 17th century English Civil War battles that took place in the same area.  Yesterday contractors supplied as many as 300 of their own security guards.  350 trees were felled, and there were 39 arrests.  In a separate development, Thames Valley Police have asked the government to help meet the rising costs of the enterprise.  They fear that policing the protest could cost up to £12 million."
388,"For centuries, Twyford Down has been regarded as one of the most mystical places in the South.   It was recognised as a gathering place for ancient tribes, and has long been acknowledged as a site of extensive ecological and historical importance.      Twyford Down is criss-crossed by 'Dongas', The paths, around St Catherine's Hill, were formed over centuries by people walking their animals into market and travelling between ancient sites and monuments.      St Catherine's Hill was a centre of human settlement around 3,000 years ago, long before the founding of Winchester. A fort was constructed in the 3rd century BC, and a Norman chapel was built in the 12th century AD.     The mysterious 'Mismaze' on top of the hill is 624 metres in length and is thought to have been first cut in the 17th Century.     Today the area is a nature reserve, renowned for its flower-rich turf and for butterflies such as the spectacular marbled white. Scrub removal and continued grazing helps maintain the hill's clear open aspect. The presence of cattle and sheep improves conditions for wildlife, recreating the type of traditional chalk landscape last seen in the 1930s.   Click through our photo gallery of Twyford Down and archive pictures of the famous roads protests.    The area hit the national headlines in the early 1990s when roads protestors, angry at the building of the new M3 extension which included a 400 foot wide and 100 foot deep cutting through the face of the Down.      Twyford Down became a byword for a new generation of protests and brought together people from all over the country, united in their opposition to the scheme.     Groups like Road Alert, Earth First and the 'Donga Tribe' built tree houses and tunnels to delay the work.     Between 1993 and 1995, thousands of people joined in the protests on the site - many were arrested. Although the protests proved unsuccessful in stopping the M3 extension, they greatly added to the cost of the project and are credited with starting a re-think in government road building policy.     A decade after the original protests, the area is once again attracting the attention of environmental protestors as there are controversal proposals to turn public land, given in compensation for the original M3 by-pass, into a park and ride car park.     Emotions unsuprisingly run high over protecting an area that not only dominates the landscape around Winchester, but for centuries has been one of the most spiritual locations in the South and now is ranked alongside the likes of Avebury, Iona and Lindisfarne in the BBC's poll to find the UK's Favourite Spiritual Place.

389,"An enormous crowd has gathered in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria, to celebrate the adoption of Muslim Sharia law.  Several other states in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria have adopted Sharia this year, in apparent violation of an agreement with the federal government not to do so.  Christian leaders in Borno, who comprise a substantial minority, say they are strongly opposed to Sharia.  Reports from Maiduguri say there was a large police presence on the streets on Saturday. Christians kept a low profile, closing their shops and businesses and choosing to stay at home. Heavy rainfall disrupted the ceremony, but it did not prevent an enormous crowd of Muslims - estimated by one eyewitness as being in the hundreds of thousands - from gathering in the central square. The governor of Borno state, Mala Kachalla, like other northern governors, has sought to reassure Christians by emphasising that Sharia, which includes punishments like amputation and flogging, will only apply to Muslims.  But Christian leaders in Borno told the BBC that they felt their freedoms were under threat, and have embarked on three days of prayer and fasting in protest. The divisions which Sharia has opened up have provided Nigeria's new democratic government with one of its most difficult challenges. In the city of Kaduna earlier this year more than 1,000 people were killed in fighting between Christians and Muslims. Sharia has been supported by some northern politicians who are opposed to the government. But it also has massive popular appeal to those who believe it will help root out corruption and restore moral values."

391,"The latest new vodka brand has caused a row in the US state of Idaho. But why are so many different types of the colourless, flavourless spirit on sale in the US and UK?  ""I judge a vodka by how I feel the next day. Our hangovers are minimal,"" says Steve Conlin, vice-president of marketing for Ogden's Own Distillery, makers of Five Wives Vodka.  ""It's made from spring water from a mountain spring. It's a good clean vodka.""  Five Wives sold well in Utah, where it is produced and bottled.  But when Conlin applied for a licence to sell it in neighbouring Idaho, it was rejected by the state liquor authority, which decides what gets stocked in the state's stores.  The authority's director, Jeff Anderson, did not like the cheeky name - a reference to polygamy practised by the 19th Century ancestors of America's Mormon population. Also, he said, there was simply no room on the shelves.  ""We've got an over-proliferation of vodkas,"" Anderson told the Idaho Business Review last week.  Idaho sells 450 varieties of vodka, he said, including different sizes of a single brand, and Five Wives would have to compete with 106 other vodkas in its price range.  ""We're telling people 'no' a lot of the time,"" he said. ""Beyond the name, this product is trying to enter a competitive set that is crowded already. ""  In recent years, drinkers in the US and the UK have been overwhelmed by a glut of new vodka brands.  Some of those are traditional Eastern European brands newly introduced on the export market, and others are ""dreamed up overnight"", says Jerald O'Kennard, director of the Beverage Testing Institute in Chicago.  ""It's relatively easy to produce,"" he says. ""You don't have to age it in a warehouse, in a barrel like a whiskey or a rum, and they're the most popular spirits. You've got a tsunami of economic and business reasons contributing to those numbers.""  The spate of new entrants comes even though most drinkers cannot tell the difference between vodkas of similar quality, spirits experts say.  In the US, by law, classic vodka is near flavourless. US regulations require that vodka produced in the US be ""neutral"" and be sold ""without distinctive character, aroma, taste or colour"". Vodkas with added flavouring such as vanilla or rasberry are treated differently.  Spirits experts say that in fact, drunk neat and at room temperature, premium vodkas do offer a variety of subtle variations in flavour, sweetness, mouth feel and weight.  But the average punter who orders a vodka-tonic cannot taste the difference, and even in blind taste tests average drinkers cannot consistently distinguish between different bottles, according to analysis by market research firm Mintel.  ""They're using it in mixed drinks,"" says Noah Rothbaum, editor-in-chief of Liquor.com and author of The Business of Spirits.  ""Once you add it to, say, cranberry juice, or once it's shaken with a lot of ice, those differences are harder and harder to differentiate.""  Many American vodkas contribute little to the actual manufacturing - they merely purchase 95% ethyl alcohol from industrial giants like Archer Daniels Midland or Midwest Grain Processors, add water, and filter the product to varying degrees.  With little noticeable distinction in taste, vodka makers rely on sophisticated marketing and branding campaigns to win customers, analysts say.  ""Making it stand out on the back bar, on the liquor store shelf, making it look cool on the table in a club, these are not small considerations,"" Rothbaum says.  Most wine bottles conform to a handful of different shapes. But companies launching a new vodka brand will hire teams to design a distinct bottle to catch the eye, for instance. (Cheap Shot sells its ""knockout quality"" vodka in a box.)  Distilled Resources Inc, also in Idaho, ferments, distils and bottles high-end flavoured and unflavoured vodkas for dozens of brands who contract with the company.  ""They came up with the name, they selected the bottle,"" says Gray Ottley, the distillery's director and vice-chairman, about one of the vodkas.  ""That's their brand. They filed the trade mark.""  In fact, three of the company's oldest brand partners - Blue Ice, Glacier and Zodiac - sell the same potato vodka, Ottley says.  Ogden's Own, based in Ogden, Utah, markets its vodka to drinkers who want something made locally.  The label, which features five young women in 19th Century dress coyly tugging at their petticoats, was an irreverent nod to Utah's Mormon history.  ""Our label is quirky and interesting,"" says Conlin. ""People like local.""  It has sold well in the six months it has been on the market, approaching Absolut in the 750ml category, he says.  Since Jeff Anderson of the Idaho liquor authority suggested religious and moral considerations played a role in the decision to keep Five Wives off the shelf, Ogden's Own hired a prominent Washington constitutional lawyer.  On Wednesday, Idaho relented and agreed to allow retail customers, bars and restaurants in the state to place special orders of Five Wives. Anderson also invited Conlin to reapply to sell Five Wives on store shelves.  ""The exposure's been very good,"" Conlin says.  ""We're happy to have this resolved and hopefully we'll be selling product in Idaho fairly quickly."""
392,"A former CIA officer sentenced to 30 months in prison has told the BBC he has made peace with his decision to leak a covert officer's name.  John Kiriakou says he believes the case was about larger human rights issues.  He is the first person convicted of identifying a covert agent in 27 years.  Defence lawyers argued that Kiriakou's actions - giving a journalist the name of a former CIA officer alleged to have taken part in waterboarding - were those of a whistleblower.  Kiriakou, 48, is set to begin the prison term on Thursday.  ""I feel oddly optimistic about the coming two years,"" he told the BBC in an interview. ""I feel very much at peace with my decision to go public on the torture issue.""  Kiriakou, a CIA officer from 1990-2004, led an operation that captured Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaeda financier.  Zubaydah was allegedly subjected to waterboarding - simulated drowning - 83 times during interrogation.  The investigation into Kiriakou's leak began after lawyers for suspected terrorists filed a legal brief that included details not provided by the government.  FBI investigators followed the trail back to Kiriakou and arrested him in January 2012, according to court records.  Prosecutors said that in 2008 the former officer leaked the name of a covert operative to a journalist, who subsequently disclosed it to a researcher working for the lawyer of a Guantanamo detainee.  When asked why he decided to leak the name, he told the BBC: ""My case was not about leaking - my case was about torture.""  ""This is a case about civil liberties and human rights,"" he said. ""Somebody needs to take a stand. I am very proud to have had a role in that.""  Kiriakou pleaded guilty in October to disclosing classified information identifying a covert agent. A deal with prosecutors limited his sentence to 30 months. Several other charges were dropped.  ""It was a crime,"" he said. ""I had no intent to violate the law. I think it was my whistle-blowing that led to this sentence.""  Prosecutors argued Kiriakou was merely seeking to increase his fame and public stature by trading on his insider knowledge. He later worked as a consultant for a US news network and published a book about his time at the CIA.  Kiriakou says he will spend his time in prison exercising and writing, but intends to use the attention the case has afforded him afterwards.  ""The justice department has made me a hero in the human rights community,"" he said. ""I intend to use this notoriety.""  John Kiriakou was interviewed by the BBC World Service programme World Update. Listen back to the interview via BBC iPlayer or download a podcast."
393,"London Fire Brigade (LFB) said Bill Faust, 36, and Adam Meere, 27, were among 50 officers called to the blaze in Bethnal Green Road, at 0400 BST.  Two people were rescued from the roof during the fire, which is being treated as suspicious by police.  The firefighters got into difficulty in the lower part of the building where the fire was most severe.  They died soon after arriving at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel.  Mr Meere only finished his training in May and then joined Whitechapel fire station.  The last firefighter to die in London was in 1993 in Willesden, north London.  Two members of the public were also taken to hospital on Tuesday and released after a routine check-up.  London Fire Brigade Assistant Commissioner Malcolm Kelly said that when firefighters arrived at the building they discovered a ""serious"" fire in the clothes shop and its basement.  He said smoke had reached all floors and was coming out of the windows.  Mr Faust and Mr Meere had entered the building wearing breathing apparatus but colleagues had to rescue them.  Mr Kelly said: ""It's a very tragic day for us and it's one of the worst events to befall an organisation like us.  ""A lot of my colleagues are very upset and distressed at the moment and we're doing everything possible to help them come through the next few days.""  London mayor Ken Livingstone said: ""This sad news serves as a reminder to us all of the tremendous work and sacrifice being made by these dedicated individuals on a daily basis.""  Firefighters are still at the scene damping down and the borough surveyor is on site examining the building which has suffered structural damage.  LFB investigation officers and police are looking into the cause of the fire."
394,"A fire at Buckingham Palace forced officials to evacuate the building on Sunday in the middle of four days of celebrations to honour the Queen's Golden Jubilee.  The blaze, which according to Palace sources started in a disused toilet in the palace's west wing, has been extinguished and salvage teams are now inspecting the damage.  A Scotland Yard spokesman said no-one from the Royal family was inside the Palace at the time, adding that as far as he knew nobody was injured.  The fire had cast doubts on whether Monday's pop concert in the Palace gardens would go ahead, but the event's organisers have confirmed that it will.  A Palace spokesman said: ""There is absolutely no question of it not.""  The fire broke out in the loft of the West Terrace at 1841 BST, but was contained in a small area and was extinguished within an hour.  Steve Newman, a fire fighter on the scene, said: ""We had around 20 pumps and the royal household has been fully informed.  ""In the course of fire fighting, four people were escorted from the roof.  ""They were staff who were guided down through the house. They were staff working on the roof.""  Fire Commissioner Brian Robinson said: ""There has been no damage to any of the Queen's treasures or artefacts  ""There is some water damage to carpets, partly caused by us and partly by damaged pipes during the course of the fire.""  The cause of the fire is being investigated by the fire brigade and the Metropolitan Police, but arson is not suspected.  The Palace and the grounds were evacuated, including hundreds of artists, musicians and workers preparing for the pop concert.  A massive music auditorium with stage and stands had been constructed in the garden and rehearsals were under way when the fire was spotted.  Queen guitarist Brian May said he had been about to rehearse with Joe Cocker when the evacuation began.  He told BBC News 24: ""It was all going extremely well ... then everything ground to a halt.  ""We've all been herded to this area by the tennis courts. Everyone's quite calm - it takes as long as it takes.""  He said the fire had not affected high spirits and described the scene as an ""enormous crowd of extremely famous people all sitting around on the lawn and chatting"".  TV and radio presenter Jamie Theakston told BBC News 24 that everyone ""was cleared away very safely"".  Palace staff are now being allowed back into the building and rehearsals have resumed.  Nick Vaghan Barret, organiser of Monday's concert, said it would go ahead as scheduled.  ""The fire is now out. The only concern is water damage and how to contain that,"" he said.  ""There will be Dunkirk spirit there tonight - I can't wait to get back in there.  ""We are not using the inside of the Palace at all, we are outside in the gardens - then I'm absolutely confident the concert will go ahead, unless there is something we do not know.""  The Queen was at Windsor Castle when the fire broke out. She was not due to return to Buckingham Palace on Sunday and has confirmed that she will stay at Windsor tonight.  At the height of the fire flames could be seen coming out of the roof as the fire began to take hold.  Fire fighters wearing breathing apparatus clambered on to the roof of the West Terrace, directing hoses towards the centre of the fire.  Crowds outside the Palace were moved down the Mall by police.  It is 10 years since much of Windsor Castle was destroyed by fire.  More than 100 rooms, covering an area of 7,000 square metres, were damaged in the blaze, which is thought to have been started by a spotlight shining on a curtain."
395,"A series of bomb attacks on London's transport network has killed more than 30 people and injured about 700 others.  Three explosions on the Underground left 35 dead and two died in a blast on a double decker bus.  The first three bombs went off at 0850 on underground trains just outside Liverpool Street and Edgware Road stations, and on another travelling between King's Cross and Russell Square.  The final explosion was around an hour later on a number 30 double-decker bus in Tavistock Square, not far from King's Cross  Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the bombings had ""the hallmarks of an al-Qaeda-related attack"".  Prime Minister Tony Blair promised the ""most intense police and security service action to make sure we bring those responsible to justice"".  Mr Blair, who flew back to London from the G8 summit in Gleneagles, condemned the terrorists and paid tribute to the stoicism and resilience of the people of London.  ""They are trying to use the slaughter of innocent people to cow us, to frighten us out of doing the things that we want to do,"" he said in a televised statement from Downing Street."
396,"On 28 February 1975 a London Underground train crashed at Moorgate station, killing 43 and injuring many more.  The train, arriving from Drayton Park, was packed with commuters when it overshot the platform and ploughed into a dead-end tunnel.  The intense heat and twisted wreckage meant the last passenger was not rescued until late in the evening.  Here are six accounts from people caught up in the disaster.  The train was not very busy and because I knew the exit at Moorgate was close to the front of the train I got into the front carriage and found myself a seat, next to the second set of doors.  I was reading my newspaper and I did not notice how far we were from Moorgate. Nothing was wrong until the train shuddered and I leant a little forward, because of the movement of the train.  Just above my newspaper I saw a lady sitting opposite me and then the lights went out. I have the image of her face to this day. She died.  As darkness came, there was a very loud noise of the crash, metal and glass breaking, no screams, all in the fraction of the second, one takes to breathe in. It was all over in no time.  After the sudden impact I went to a place which seemed very white and peaceful. I was kind of floating in the air, happy, but then went to another place, very hot, full of screams and I did not want to be there.  I had been knocked unconscious and have no further memory until I heard a shout in the distance: ""Is there anybody else there?"" And there was complete silence. Then my conservation instinct made me shout back: ""Yes, I am here!""  The voice from the distance shouted again asking: ""Can you move?"" I had my hands near my shoulders and I tried to lift myself up, but I could not because of pain. I was not fully conscious, did not know where I was, but I shouted back: ""No, I cannot move"".  I then heard the distant voice shouting again: ""Cover your face up and we'll get you out!"" I crossed my hands behind my head and felt nothing, heard nothing - I was unconscious.  The next thing I remember is that someone was lifting my body, holding me from under my armpits and I asked him: ""Who are you?""  He said ""I am David - I work for the rescue services"", so I said: ""Thank you David"". But I do not know why I was saying all this - I still did not know where I was or what had happened.  Javier Gonzalez was taken to St Bartholomew's hospital where he spent several weeks recovering from his injuries.  I was the first police officer and the first person to arrive at the Moorgate train disaster, before the fire brigade or ambulance.  I spoke to a ticket collector at the barrier on arrival and he had no idea what I was talking about. When I descended the platform by escalator, smoke started coming up from the tunnel.  I ran down the platform trying to smash windows with my truncheon, with some success, but most people were in the front carriages as this was the final stop. I assisted in getting some people off the last carriages and then to the way out.  I remained on scene for many hours until relieved by the commander of British Transport Police. The first police officer on scene normally has to stay until relieved by the most senior officer for continuity of evidence.  I attended the post mortem and was given a commendation by the coroner.  I was just about to complete my training as an ambulance man with the London Ambulance Service and was due for posting to my permanent station in the next few weeks.  I and my crew mate were working unsupervised at Smithfield Ambulance Station near the Old Bailey that day.  The first I heard of the accident was as I was driving to work from my home in Charlton and the 1400 news announced the accident on the car radio.  I was stunned, terrified and excited all at the same time, as I quickly realised that we would be attending very soon and only the casualties that were trapped would remain for us to deal with.  We eventually relieved the morning crew at 1530 and took over a completely stripped ambulance with only a radio, two hardhats and two wheeled stretchers on board.  On arrival at the underground station we were told to back the ambulance doors to the entrance, which was in front of the media and, await the next casualty to be released.  We waited for five hours until WPC Margaret Liles was brought to the surface, having been released by having her foot amputated shortly before. We raced her to St Bartholomew's Hospital - just about one mile away - under police escort and with a team of surgeons in attendance in the back.  I was working in the operating theatres at St Bartholomew's Hospital. I regularly worked in the old orthopaedic theatre which was in the basement. On this morning I arrived for work and busied myself preparing for a routine operating list.  A little while later I was told that the elective list was cancelled because the Margate train had crashed. I remember asking myself why and how Barts should be involved in what was essentially a south of the river, Southern Region incident.  It was only an hour or so later that I realised I had misheard and that Moorgate was the scene of the crash.  I remember four or five patients coming to my theatre that day. We probably had a similar number the following day as victims were still being pulled out of the wreckage.  I recall that everyone was speculating if the train driver and front passengers were likely to be brought out alive, but as time passed that became increasingly unlikely. I believe that when he was eventually extricated his injuries were such that he must have died instantly.  I was a student at the City of London Business School at that time. On the day, I entered the building via the London Wall gate, and didn't see all the fuss that was happening on Moorgate itself (where our main entrance was).  So it was not until some hours later that we came out and saw all the emergency vehicles and fire fighters outside.  Our lecture was interrupted by someone asking us to donate blood, so I went off with a group of other students to the donor centre opposite, never thinking to call my parents in Manchester to let them know I was ok.  However, my mother saw me queuing outside the centre on BBC News that night and knew I was ok.  I didn't have a television then, so I didn't see the footage until I watched the video report on this website.  Alan Perkin, lucky escape   I regularly used to use that Northern Line branch as I worked near Moorgate station and I would make the interchange daily from the Victoria Line at Highbury Station.  On that fateful day, I arrived at Highbury and my Moorgate train was already waiting at the platform. I decided to miss that one and wait for the next, but at the last moment, on a sudden impulse I changed my mind and made a dash just as the doors were closing.  I therefore arrived at Moorgate on the train directly in front of the one which was to crash. The emergency sirens started just as I reached my office in Finsbury Square.  It was horrific, as most people regularly used to cram into the first few carriages because the escalators were right at the front end of the platform.  After that day, lots of ""familiar"" faces on the morning train were never seen again."
397,"Up to 35 people have died and 100 others have been injured after three trains were involved in a collision during morning rush hour in south London.  Two commuter trains carrying an estimated 1,300 passengers between them collided shortly after 0800 GMT at Clapham Junction - Europe's busiest railway junction.  A third empty train later ran into the wreckage killing some passengers who had survived the first crash.  Many passengers are still trapped as fire crews are cutting through the tangled carriages to reach them.  Emergency services have said the extent of the injuries mean some passengers have received operations at the scene.  At nearby St George's Hospital in Tooting staff are on emergency alert as coaches and ambulances wait to take those needing medical care to its new accident and emergency unit.  Passengers well enough to leave by foot, stood by the rail track and were described as ""visibly shocked and distressed"".  Many have been taken to a nearby school for first aid treatment.  Witnesses, unable to reach survivors because of the extent of the wreckage, have reported seeing appalling injuries.  They described how carriages were sent hurtling into the air before crashing back down again after the collision.  The accident took place when the 0718 from Basingstoke to Waterloo approached the junction.  Early reports indicate it was slowing for signals when the 0614 from Poole, travelling from Bournemouth due to track problems, ran into the back of it.  Experts have said this train would have been travelling at about 40mph.  Shortly afterwards an empty train leaving Clapham junction hit the wreckage.  British Rail has said initial reports indicate the crash was caused by signalling failures.  The Transport Secretary Paul Cannon is understood to be on his way to the scene of the tragedy."
398,"More than 200 firefighters have tackled a blaze described by London Fire Brigade as the biggest seen in the capital for several years.  The brigade was called at about 13:15 BST when flames took hold at a recycling centre in Dagenham, east London.  Smoke was visible for miles as the single-storey building burned, but there were no injuries.  The brigade said fire cover at Olympic venues had not been affected.  There were initial reports that people could see the smoke from the Olympic Park, approximately six miles away.  The closing ceremony got under way at 21:00 BST.  But the BBC Weather Centre said the wind was likely to take the smoke northwards during the evening, away from the stadium.  London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: ""We've not seen a fire of this size in London for several years - it's certainly a dramatic end to the Olympics for the London Fire Brigade.  ""That said though, we are still able to attend incidents across the capital and the fire cover we're providing at the Olympic venues has not been affected.  ""At this stage we aren't sure how the blaze started as our focus is getting the flames under control.  ""Fire crews will remain at the scene for as long as necessary and a thorough investigation will begin once the fire is out in order to establish how it started.""  At its height the whole of the 100m (330ft) by 50m building was ablaze and some 40 fire engines were at the scene.  The fire was under control by 17:00 BST, but firefighters will continue damping the building down overnight."

400,"Hereford Livestock Market's controversial move to a new site after more than 150 years in the city centre has been hailed a ""success story"" a year on.  The market moved to a £7m home at Stretton Sugwas, on the outskirts of the city centre, to make way for the £90m regeneration around Edgar Street.  Richard Hyde, director of Hereford Market Auctioneers, which has run both sites, said sales were up and the new market was attracting more visitors.  At about 16 acres, the custom-built site was more than double the size and much more accessible, he said.  ""We've brought people back who haven't been to Hereford for 20 years because of the congestion and parking and difficulty getting in and out,"" he said.  ""There are new people virtually every week.""  Mr Hyde said there had a ""phenomenal"" increase in the number of cows sold through the market, with 2012 so far seeing a 59% increase.  Meanwhile, the number of sheep sales was up about 22%.  He said this time of year was particularly busy for lamb sales.  ""At the moment, lamb numbers through this market are in the top three in the country,"" he said.  Mr Hyde said the site along the Roman Road, which can accommodate about 240,000 animals a year and is set to expand, suited the future of farming.  ""Food production is massively important,"" he said.  ""The new site is an absolute godsend. It is what state-of the-art marketing in the 21st Century should be - ease of access, ease of parking. It's customer friendly and it's animal friendly. It is very nearly perfect.""  He said in contrast, the city centre site ""was a nightmare on busy days"".  The departure of the market from the city centre was met with criticism, particularly by some residents who said a slice of history would be lost as well as the market's distinctive atmosphere.  The cost of the move, which was funded by Conservative-run Herefordshire Council, was also criticised.  Mark Hubbard, leads the nine It's Our County councillors who had raised objections over the scheme.  He said the group was not against the move itself but had ""asked questions"" over the costs being borne by taxpayers.  ""I'm very glad that it's doing well, because that is what Herefordshire is about,"" he said.  However, Mr Hubbard said you had to consider how much the old site could have been improved with a £7m upgrade.  In addition, the party is opposed to the £90m retail development on the old cattle market site, which he said would ""absolutely"" damage the ""traditional market town centre"" and its shops.  ""Also it's the idea of such a retail development being built during a recession when everywhere else is contracting its retail offer,"" he said.  Meanwhile, Elwyn Maddy, a beef and sheep farmer from Michaelchurch Escley, said there had been fears the market could have been lost for good.  ""There had been a lot of opposition about spending that sort of money but it's important for the farming and rural community and it's success answers criticism that we did not need it.""  A farmer for 40 years who sits on the NFU's West Midlands Livestock Board, Mr Maddy added feedback from other farmers had generally been ""very positive"".  ""Without a doubt it's a success story,"" he said. You're getting livestock from a very large area. The layout is good, the amenities are good, it's all positive."""
401,"Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney has married American heiress Nancy Shevell at a ceremony in London.  The couple posed for pictures outside Old Marylebone Town Hall register office after being showered with confetti by wedding guests.  Ms Shevell, 51, from New York, is an heiress to a haulage fortune.  She is Sir Paul's third wife after Linda McCartney died in 1998 and he split from second wife Heather Mills in an acrimonious divorce in 2008.  Ms Shevell wore a white, long-sleeved dress and held a bouquet of roses, while the former Beatle wore a dark suit with a white shirt and pale blue tie for the occasion.  Hundreds of fans gathered outside the central London register office to see the couple arrive and depart from their wedding ceremony, and barricades were erected.  A large group of journalists and photographers also waited for several hours before the newlyweds finally emerged.  The wedding party spent more than an hour inside the venue before emerging on the steps of the building.  The couple then returned to their home in St John's Wood, London, for a reception with family and close friends.  When asked how he felt after tying the knot for a third time, Sir Paul told waiting reporters: ""Terrific, thank you. I feel married,"" adding, ""I feel absolutely wonderful.""  James McCartney, Sir Paul's son, was among the first to arrive for the party at the couple's home on Sunday evening.  'Going to last'  He was closely followed by the groom's daughters Mary and Stella, who designed the bride's gown.  Ronnie Wood, of the Rolling Stones, said he wished the couple a ""very happy future"" as he entered the party.  And Sir Paul's former Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr, one of the last to arrive at around 1930 BST, said his message for the couple was ""peace and love"".  Ms Shevell, who was married for 20 years to American lawyer and political candidate Bruce Blakeman, became engaged to Sir Paul in May.  The couple began dating four years ago in the upmarket Hamptons area of Long Island.  Life-long Beatles fan Chiara Amato said she had sat outside the register office every day since September 29 in anticipation of the couple's wedding.  She said: ""This marriage is going to last. She seems to be really nice and deeply in love with him. I have been listening to The Beatles since I was six years old. I have been to see Sir Paul in concert 27 times.""  Ms Shevell is a board member of New York's transportation authority and vice-president of her family haulage firm.  But the wedding is expected to mean an end to her work in the family business and her leaving her position on the board of the transportation body."
402,"Under-18s in New Zealand can only watch Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why with their parents, after the show was reclassified.  The country's Office of Film & Literature Classification has created a new category for the show, which will now be known as RP18.  13 Reasons Why has been a success but has also generated controversy.  It deals with the effects of a teen suicide on friends, family and the classmates she blames for her death.  Mental health charities have criticised the series for showing the character's suicide on screen and accused producers of glorifying the act.  New Zealand has the highest rate of teen suicide in the developed world and says that's why it introduced a new rating for 13 Reasons Why.  ""The most immediate concern for the Classification Office is how teen suicide is discussed and shown in 13 Reasons Why,"" reads a post by the Office of Film & Literature Classification.  ""Hannah's suicide is presented fatalistically. Her death is represented at times as not only a logical, but an unavoidable outcome of the events that follow.  ""Suicide should not be presented to anyone as being the result of clear headed thinking.  ""Suicide is preventable, and most people who experience suicidal thoughts are not thinking rationally and therefore cannot make logical decisions.""  13 Reasons Why is rated 18 in the UK, which the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) states is due to sexual violence, strong bloody images and the suicide scene.  ""The BBFC regularly consults with experts, including Samaritans, to help ensure that our classification policies and decisions in relation to challenging content are aligned with expert advice,"" Murray Perkins, compliance manager at the BBFC, tells Newsbeat.  ""Consequently, the BBFC operates a strict policy when it comes to depictions of lesser known techniques of suicide, for example.  ""After careful consideration, the BBFC classified 13 Reasons Why 18 meaning that we do not consider the series as a whole to be suitable for those who are not adults.""  Netflix also says it took precautions when making the show.  ""We knew the material covered sensitive topics, as the book did when it was published in 2007, and we worked with mental health experts to show how these issues impact teens in real and dramatic ways,"" says a statement from Netflix given to Newsbeat.  The US company claims it brought in several measures to address the controversial content in 13 Reasons Why.  ""We gave the series an 18 rating, added explicit warnings on the three most graphic episodes, produced an after show, Beyond the Reasons, that delves deeper into some of the tougher topics portrayed, as well as created a global website to help people find local mental health resources.""  13 Reasons Why is the most tweeted about TV show of 2017, with 11 million mentions on Twitter since its debut in March.

403,"Grays Athletic have parted company with manager Julian Dicks by mutual consent after 20 months in charge.  The 42-year-old has overseen a tumultuous time at the club, who dropped three divisions last summer because of financial problems.  Grays chief executive Andy Swallow told BBC Essex: ""We felt Julian wants to manage at a higher level and we had to do what was best for Grays Athletic.""  Grays finished 10th in Ryman Division One North this season.  Former West Ham and Liverpool defender Dicks was appointed Grays boss in September 2009 but they ended last season bottom of the 23 teams that finished the Blue Square Premier and dropped straight down another two divisions.  Dicks' only previous managerial experience came in the Eastern Counties League Premier Division during a five-month spell with Wivenhoe Town in the second half of the 2008/09 campaign.  On Monday, he announced his interest in becoming manager of West Ham, who will play five divisions above Grays next season.  Swallow said the Essex side would have a new manager in place within the next week.  ""It's already underway,"" he explained.  ""We will be wrapped up in four or five days, we've got a fans' meeting on 26 May, we''ll unveil the new manager at that meeting."""
404,"The 11-year-old, of Adambrae in Livingston, disappeared after being dropped off for school on Thursday.  A post-mortem examination is now being carried out in an attempt to determine the cause of his death.  The community expressed its grief following the discovery of his body on Sunday afternoon, with flowers being laid at the entrance to the woods.  Officers said Rory's death was being treated as suspicious, which is standard procedure when a body is found in the open air.  He had not been seen since his mother Michelle dropped him off near Meldrum Primary in the Deans area of the town at about 0830 BST on Thursday.  The alarm was raised on Thursday afternoon when Rory's grandfather went to collect him from school and it was found he had not been in classes all day.  A search was launched and escalated over the weekend as fears for his safety grew.  His body was found just before 1300 BST on Sunday in woods at the western end of Dechmont Law, between the M8 and Meldrum Primary. Forensic teams have continued to examine the area.  Chief Inspector Jim Thomson, who led the search for Rory, said his thoughts were with the boy's family.  He said there had been a ""fantastic response"" from people who wanted to help with the search.  ""Over the weekend we had nearly 300 members of the public helping us with the search in addition to the 70 trained mountain search and rescue teams and specialist police officers,"" he said.  ""This shows the strength of community spirit in the area and how much everyone has been affected by recent events.""  Police were at Meldrum Primary on Monday to talk to parents about whether they remember anything unusual about last Thursday morning.  Officers have also been stationed at the town's other primary schools to offer reassurance.  The parents taking their children to Meldrum Primary on Monday included 37-year-old mother-of-two Karen Carroll.  She said: ""My son normally walks to school as we live close by but obviously that's changed at the moment.  ""I'll take him there and back - that's the safest thing to do, I think.""  Deacon Glenda Wilson, of Livingston Ecumenical Parish, said: ""The clergy and all the people of the Livingston churches had been hoping and praying that Rory would be found safe and well.  ""The whole community has been greatly saddened by the news.""  The people who laid flowers at the entrance to the woods included 38-year-old Brian McPhillie, who said: ""It is just a tragedy what has happened.  ""Everyone is emotional. We've just been to the primary school and the kids are out in the playground but they are not playing. It is very sad."""
405,"The French operations of the US cosmetics giant Avon Products are to be closed by the end of the month.  Avon's Parisian office says only current orders will be guaranteed and it is unsure if its self-employed representatives will be able to get supplies after the end of October.  Avon has been in France for almost 50 years.  It employs about 120 staff in Paris, supporting 11,000 representatives who visit customers in their own homes.  Angry workers in France have accused Avon of keeping them in the dark for months and not acting in line with Avon's publically stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of ""open and candid communication"".  Estelle Croissant, an Avon employee responsible for supporting the direct selling representatives, told the BBC that a workers' council representing Avon staff in France was challenging the company for not following the correct redundancy process.  ""They have not respected all the processes according to their own rules and values,"" she said.  ""We now know an administrator has been in place since May this year, but no scheme to assist the workers is yet in place. We just feel abandoned.  ""We knew that the business was not good, but we have all been very committed and worked relentlessly over many months to help the company to try and become profitable.""  Further meetings are taking place between workers' representatives and the management.  Avon is one of the world's largest beauty companies and sells most of its products through direct selling by self-employed representatives who visit customers in their homes.  The US parent company has been through a string of reorganisations and management changes.  Two years ago, it turned down a takeover offer from rival cosmetic company Coty.  Asked by the BBC about events at its French subsidiary, a spokesman for the parent company refused to make any comment or even confirm the closure was taking place."

A Zimbabwe presidential spokesman said Mr Dell was lucky to be alive.  Zimbabwe's foreign ministry said Mr Dell had shown ""flagrant disregard"" for Zimbabwe's security laws.  ""The American ambassador must consider himself very lucky that he is dealing with a professional army that the Zimbabwean national army is,"" presidential spokesman George Charamba told the state-run Herald newspaper.  ""Elsewhere, and definitely in America, he would have been a dead man.""  The Herald said Mr Dell had been arrested by a special presidential army unit when he entered a restricted zone in the botanical gardens, near President Robert Mugabe's official residence.  The Zimbabwean ministry of foreign affairs has protested to the US embassy about the incident, which took place on Monday afternoon.  ""Such action was taken in a calculated disregard of the rules governing relations between states and was clearly intended to provoke an unwarranted diplomatic incident,"" it added.  The US mission said two senior Zimbabwean government officials had apologised for Mr Dell's detention and that it considered the matter closed.  Relations between the US and Zimbabwe have soured in recent years, with Washington accusing Mr Mugabe's government of rigging elections and abusing human rights."
407,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A Nottinghamshire singer has released a Christmas song she hopes will challenge Simon Cowell's X-Factor winner for the festive number one spot. Christmas Time is the title of Cathy Lesurf's single that comes out 30 years after she was last in the charts. As a member of Fiddler's Dram she reached number three in 1980 with Day Trip to Bangor. Cathy's song will not have the publicity clout of the X-Factor release. Her budget is £150. Three decades ago Cathy Lesurf performed on Top of the Pops with her group Fiddler's Dram. They never repeated the success of Day Trip to Bangor and are forever bracketed ""one hit wonders"". Cathy feels now is the time to lose that tag. The seeds of the song come from the death of a friend. Cathy and her husband, David Wilson, were putting together a benefit gig for Linda Sawyer when she died from cancer. The concert still took place and the legacy was that, after years of steering clear of the stage, Cathy and David were back behind the microphone. It rekindled their love of music. Then Cathy's 19-year-old daughter Rosalyn alerted her to the fact that more than 60,000 people had watched clips of Day Trip Bangor on YouTube. I wish him (Simon Cowell) all the luck in the world and I wish myself all the luck in the world. Let the people decide    Cathy Lesurf on competing against the X-Factor contestants It just so happened that David had written a tune for Cathy called Christmas Time. The singer said: ""We're all singing it round the house and I thought maybe it's time Bangor had a companion piece and I said 'hello' to all those people out there who like what I do."" The song was recorded in October 2009. A few weeks later a video was filmed in Cathy's back garden featuring family and friends. It was shot in a day. The whole process cost around £150 after Cathy, from West Bridgford, called in some favours. She said it matched the spirit of the song. ""It's about getting the family together, getting the tree, the presents. It's having a big Christmas Eve party, it's singing carols. I love the traditional message of Christmas. I love the love in it."" The chorus to the song goes: ""All the family round the tree, A gift for you, a gift for me."" Day Trip to Bangor was a hit for Cathy Lesurf and Fiddler's Dram in 1980 Composer David Wilson said: ""That's the heart of it - sharing gifts and expressing love and affection. It's thinking about the person you're buying the gift for."" Now Christmas Time is available to download (CD versions might be pressed if there is a demand), a facility that was not available when Fiddler's Dram were in the charts. ""This is something new for me. I come from the days of steam driven music,"" said Cathy. ""We're emailing everybody we know and we're asking everyone to download it and pass it on. We want it to go out at grassroots level. If it goes it'll be because people have made it go."" David Wilson said the omens are good. ""People I've played it to have made such a strong connection with it. It's a simple expression of the joy of Christmas. ""For that to make an impact gives me faith. It tells me people want to feel that simple love and affection."" David Wilson was not a fan of Christmas until he met Cathy Cathy Lesurf verses Simon Cowell is the musical equivalent of David verses Goliath but the Nottinghamshire singer is undaunted. ""I prefer to go with a positive approach that they'll do their thing and it's very different to mine. ""I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I could get back in the charts. I hope people hear it and like it and it's another little miracle like Bangor. ""I wish him (Simon Cowell) all the luck in the world and I wish myself all the luck in the world. Let the people decide.""     "

Amble's Development Trust and Business Club has been awarded the cash from the government for a campaign to encourage residents to shop locally.  The first Puffin Festival will take place in May to coincide with the best time to see the birds on Coquet Island.  It will feature community exhibitions, children's events and live music.  Amble Action Group member Ann Burke said: ""I'm thrilled the Puffin Festival can go ahead. So many people are so enthusiastic about it already, so many organisations want to take part. It's going to be a great community event.  ""We hope this will encourage tourism. Amble is unique in having an island so close where the puffins breed.

Colin Harris, chairman of Amble Business Club, said: ""We'll be consulting with local businesses for ideas to encourage local people to spend money in Amble first, before going out of the area.  ""It's not just about retail, we want people to use local service providers, tradesmen and professional services as well.""  The money has been awarded by the Department for Communities and Local Government through its Town Team Partners scheme.

409,"The Scottish FA ruled out participation but have no objection to the other home nations forming sides for the men's and women's Olympic and Paralympic teams.  England and Northern Ireland are in favour, while the Welsh FA, having initially opposed the idea, are now deciding whether to reconsider.  Once they have made a decision, team selection proposals will be drawn up.  The Scottish FA had been given written assurances by Fifa president Sepp Blatter that taking part in the 2012 Games would not affect their separate identity in world football.  But the Scots fear that Blatter may not be in power in 2012 and his successor may have other views.  An SFA spokesman said: ""We are just being entirely consistent with the position we have held for years.""  London 2012 organisers had promised the first event of the Games - the opening football match - would kick off at Hampden Park, Glasgow, if the Scots supported the idea of a British team.  The Great Britain team would be limited to players aged under 23 but three overage players would be allowed.  But it is unlikely there will be a British Olympic football team beyond 2012, because no united British team plays in the European Under-21 Championships, which act as the qualifying tournament."
410,"Fifa has given its seal of approval for Britain to enter a united football team at the 2012 Olympics in London. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have voiced concern that competing as Britain could jeopardise their future as separate international teams. But Fifa insists it would not have any negative effect, should it go ahead. The matter, still unresolved, is now in the hands of the four individual football associations, who are expected to report back to Fifa in March. Though many influential figures want Britain to enter a team, the idea is still to be officially approved and the Scots remain fierce opponents. Fifa now intends to speak with all four countries to get their thoughts on whether a British team should participate in 2012 and, if the plan were to go ahead, how the team would be composed. Sepp Blatter, Fifa president, said on Saturday: ""The executive committee confirmed that the participation in the 2012 London Olympic Games of a single team representing Great Britain would not affect the existing individual status of the four British football associations. For the Olympic Games, they have to play in one entity. The ball is now in their turf    ""We have no problem with that because four British associations are identified in Fifa statutes as being four different entities. ""And, now for the Olympic Games, they have to play in one entity. The ball is now in their turf. ""We expect a solution that will be presented to us for the month of March."" Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy hopes Fifa's confirmation will pave the way to Scottish footballers taking part in 2012. ""My priority has always been to ensure the future of Scotland's national team is not affected if there was to be a one-off under-23 tournament at the Olympics,"" he said. ""I would like to see young Scots going for gold at the Olympics. ""Today's announcement means that Scotland can have the best of both worlds with our own national team safe and protected - and the best of our young players playing in a one-off under-23 Olympic tournament which will see games played at Hampden."" British prime minister Gordon Brown - himself a Scot - has spoken to Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson about leading a potential team and is urging the four home nations to get together to discuss the idea in the belief that differences can be solved. ""I think there is a way round this problem and that can be found if people can get round the table and discuss it,"" he said on Friday. I think its a fabulous idea. If there's a football tournament going on in Britain, it seems a bit daft for us to have no representation in it    ""There's a number of suggestions been made and I think that, over time, people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will see the benefits of this unique sporting event that's coming to London."" Scottish National Party MP Pete Wishart had responded to Brown's comments by again accusing the prime minister of endangering the future of Scotland's national team. Fronted by former Scotland manager Craig Brown, a 'No To Team GB' campaign has been launched to stress that any guarantees from Fifa are meaningless because rulings can be overturned because it is a democratic organisation governing by the votes of its members. Uefa general secretary David Taylor, the former SFA chief executive, also recently warned against a united British team at the Olympics. Current England coach Fabio Capello, whose contract expires in 2012, has also previously admitted it was his ""dream"" to manage the side. By 2012, it will be 52 years since a British football team has participated in the Olympics.     "

In a new report, Amnesty says women activists have suffered an ""acute"" backlash since the campaign was launched in August 2006.  Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has insisted women in his country are treated better than anywhere else.  The so-called Campaign for Equality aims to collect a million signatures for a petition to push for an end to discrimination against women.  But Amnesty says those involved in it have suffered harassment, intimidation and imprisonment. Dozens of women have been arrested.  Among those persecuted, according to the group, are Ronak Safarzadeh, jailed without charge since October after her arrest at a meeting to collect signatures.  Delaram Ali, 23, was sentenced to nearly three years in prison and 10 lashes for participation in an illegal gathering, says the Amnesty report, though the punishment was suspended while her case is re-examined.  ""Instead of intimidating and imprisoning women's rights campaigners, Iran should be unlocking the potential of its female population,"" said Amnesty's Tim Hancock.  A women's magazine was closed down earlier this year, accused by the authorities of endangering the spiritual, mental and intellectual health of its readers.  Amnesty says this is part of a wider crackdown on dissent in Iran, although it concedes that women have benefited in some way since the Islamic revolution of 1979."

News Corporation said the suggestion that Rupert Murdoch was not ""fit"" to run the business, was ""unjustified""."
413,"Conservative MP Louise Mensch has apologised to former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan for accusing him of ""boasting"" about hacking phones.  She told the Commons select committee last week that Mr Morgan had been ""very open about his personal use of phone hacking"" in his memoir The Insider.  But she now says she made a mistake and had misread a newspaper report about the book.  Mr Morgan, who denied the accusation, thanked Mrs Mensch for her apology.  Mrs Mensch made her remarks during the Commons culture, media and sport committee hearing with News Corporation bosses Rupert and James Murdoch on 19 July.  This later developed into a row between the pair on Twitter after Mrs Mensch stood by her remarks but declined to repeat them outside Parliament, where comments have greater legal protection against libel proceedings.  During the hearing the Corby MP - best known as the best-selling author Louise Bagshawe until she married Peter Mensch, manager of rock band Metallica, in June - asked why the committee not spoken to Mr Morgan about phone hacking.  She said: ""As a former editor of the Daily Mirror, he said in his book The Insider recently that that 'little trick' of entering a 'standard four digit code' will allow 'anyone' to call a number and 'hear all your messages'.  ""In that book, he boasted that using that 'little trick' enabled him to win scoop of the year on a story about [former England football manager] Sven-Goran Eriksson. That is a former editor of the Daily Mirror being very open about his personal use of phone hacking.""  A furious Mr Morgan, who now hosts his own programme on the US news channel CNN, called the claim ""a complete outrage"" and challenged her to provide evidence for it.  He also accused her of being ""cowardly"" by using parliamentary privilege to make it.  On 21 July, Sly Bailey, chief executive of Daily Mirror publisher Trinity Mirror, wrote to the committee demanding the MP correct her remarks.  ""On two occasions Mrs Mensch made uncaveated statements purporting to be facts,"" she wrote. ""On both occasions she made allegations that are wholly untrue.""  In a letter to committee chairman John Whittingdale on Friday, Mrs Mensch said she had ""wrongly stated"" that Mr Morgan had ""been open about personally hacking phones"".  ""This was based on my misreading of an article in the Daily Telegraph... which covered Mr Morgan's description in his book of how to hack a phone and how he won the Scoop of the Year on the story of Sven-Goran Eriksson and [TV presenter] Ulrika Jonsson.  ""The Telegraph report covers the claim of a blogger that this story was acquired by phone hacking, and I misread that as Mr Morgan himself claiming this to be true.  ""Therefore, I must apologise to Mr Morgan and the committee for this error about his book.""  Mr Morgan later said on Twitter that he ""graciously accepted"" her apology.  Earlier on Friday, Mrs Mensch admitted it was ""highly probable"" she had taken drugs while working for record company EMI in the 1990s.  She said MPs were ""entitled to a life before politics, including making mistakes""."

It was reviewed under the CPS Victims' Right to Review Scheme, which allows people to have their case looked at again regardless of who took the decision at the CPS not to prosecute.  David Perry QC concluded that it was in the public interest to bring proceedings before a criminal court.  Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Alison Saunders said: ""I have always said that in my view this was an extremely difficult and borderline case because of the strong arguments on both sides. I have also always emphasised my concern for the complainants in this case.  ""I understood their need to be heard, which is why I contacted Justice Goddard to ensure that they could give evidence as part of the public inquiry. However, the review has concluded that this forum, albeit a public one, cannot substitute for the adjudication of the courts.  ""I accept the outcome of the review and will now be bringing this prosecution to allow for that adjudication to happen.""  Ms Saunders is the first DPP to have a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned.  She faced calls to resign following her original decision but has told the BBC she will not do so.  The announcement reverses Ms Saunders decision that the Cardiff-born peer's dementia meant he was not fit to stand trial and so it was not in the public interest for that to happen, despite there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of convictions.  A judge will now decide if Lord Janner is fit to stand trial. If not, he will face what is known as a ""trial of the facts"", where a court hears evidence from alleged victims and decides only if Lord Janner committed the physical acts of abuse. There will be no finding of guilt or conviction.  In May, six of the complainants in the case requested a formal review which concluded that although there is sufficient evidence to prosecute, it is right to assume that Lord Janner will inevitably be found unfit to plead and therefore not fit to instruct his legal team, or challenge or give evidence in a trial.  Solicitor Liz Dux, who represents some of the alleged victims, said: ""This is a vindication of our efforts to challenge the DPP's original decision not to charge Janner, which was clearly not in the interest of justice"".  ""Our clients have waited long enough for their very serious allegations to be brought before a court. They have felt deeply frustrated by the criminal justice system.""  There are only three possible outcomes from a trial of the facts. They are a hospital order, a supervision order or an absolute discharge.  The jury can only make a finding that the defendant did the particular physical act. There cannot be a verdict of guilty.  Such a trial recently took place in the case of the former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, who was accused of falsely claiming more than £53,000 in parliamentary expenses.  She was given a two-year supervision order.  In Lord Janner's case, the process would involve the alleged victims giving evidence.  A trial of the facts would most likely be strenuously opposed by Lord Janner's legal team, who would argue it was an abuse of the court process to subject him to any sort of trial where there had been so much adverse pre-trial publicity.  Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has campaigned on historical child abuse cases, called on the DPP to quit.  He said: ""I think Alison Saunders has brought the criminal justice system into disrepute, and I don't say that lightly. It was just a cold decision, it didn't take into account the alleged victims in this case.  ""There was a lot of public interest in it and she failed to accept that. This decision today actually shows she got it wrong, and she has really dented public confidence in the criminal justice system.""  However, Lord Macdonald, who was DPP between 2003 and 2008, came to Ms Saunders' defence.  He said: ""Plenty of very eminent lawyers think that Alison Saunders made the right decision. The inquiry has corrected her but I don't myself think this should be a resigning issue for her.""  Police condemned the original CPS decision as ""wrong"", and the Labour Party has suspended the peer."
415,"Twelve former residents of children's homes say they were abused by Lord Janner, a BBC investigation has found, as criminal proceedings end.  The peer, who died before a court could examine claims of child abuse against him, regularly visited homes in Leicester in the 1970s and 1980s.  An ex-police officer says he reported suspicions about Lord Janner, a decade before police began a full inquiry.  Lord Janner, who had dementia and died aged 87 in December, had denied abuse.  A ""trial of the facts"", due to take place in April, has now been shelved by prosecutors.  A jury would have been asked to decide - without reaching a decision about whether he was guilty - if 22 alleged incidents of abuse from the 1960s to the 1980s had taken place.  Lord Janner's family have said he is ""entirely innocent"" and a man of ""great integrity and high repute"".  However, the BBC has traced and interviewed dozens of men and women who lived at children's homes in Leicestershire in the 70s and 80s.  It has also spoken to council officials, social workers, police officers and journalists involved in investigating the case of Frank Beck, a notorious care home manager who was eventually convicted of child abuse.  One man, Mark, who has never spoken about his experiences publicly before, said Lord Janner, a member of the Magic Circle, would undress him, wash him and touch him intimately, during visits to the Moel Llys children's home to perform magic shows.  Mark said he was 11 or 12 at the time. ""It's mentally scarred me for life,"" he told the BBC. ""I can never get rid of it. You feel ashamed and you feel dirty. Useless and worthless.""  The BBC has learned that lawyers are now representing at least 20 men and one woman, including the 12 residents of children's homes, who say the former MP abused them.  Police have said they have information from 25 alleged victims.  Five alleged they were abused at the same Leicester primary school when Greville Janner visited. The allegations range from groping to the most serious forms of child sexual abuse.  Frank Beck was a Liberal Democrat councillor and an influential social worker.  He abused children under the cover of a childcare technique he advocated called regression therapy, which involved treating teenagers as if they were babies, but also beating and suffocating them.  Beck also picked out children for sexual abuse. He was sent to prison in 1991, where he died in 1994.  During Beck's trial, he and an alleged victim both sensationally claimed that Lord Janner was a child abuser, and the alleged victim was then interviewed by police.  Lord Janner told the House of Commons in 1991 that this man's allegations against him were ""disgraceful, contemptible and totally untrue"".  But senior figures at the Crown Prosecution Service are now understood to regard the case against Lord Janner as ""overwhelming"" - and the level of abuse alleged as ""horrific"".  A former detective, Graeme Peene, told the BBC that in the late 1970s he reported Beck, after seeing him rubbing a boy's groin at The Beeches children's home.  He was later asked to go back to The Beeches to return another boy who had run away, and was directed to Beck's office.  He said that Lord Janner - who he referred to by his first name, Greville - was sitting in an armchair ""and next to Greville Janner was this young boy"".  Mr Peene added: ""I thought - that's a bit strange. What's an MP doing there, and what's a young boy doing sitting on the arm of his chair?""  ""[Lord Janner] left the office with his arm draped over the boy's shoulder.""  ""I'd got my suspicions about Frank Beck, but [there is] also the fact that an MP is there and he is being too tactile with a young boy who is obviously in the care of the local authority.""  Mr Peene says he considered it ""an unusual occurrence"" which was ""something I felt ought to be reported"".  He claimed his report was sent to divisional headquarters where, he said, nothing was done because of a culture in which child abuse was not taken seriously.  The BBC investigation received an account by another detective that he had reported allegations against Beck, Lord Janner and other prominent Leicester figures, but his bosses ""did not want to touch it"".  Eight former residents and staff from the children's homes told the BBC they remembered Lord Janner often visiting Beck - especially at The Beeches home.  John Milligan, who worked there in the mid-80s, said he was introduced to Lord Janner by name, and claimed the MP was such a regular visitor to Frank Beck that he assumed they were having weekly meetings.  A female former resident said ""he just used to be with Frank all the time walking around"". She recognised him later from his picture in newspapers and leaflets.  And Pat Varnam, who was in the Ratcliffe Road children's home, said she often saw five or six men ""waltzing round with Beck"" and while she could not identify them, others in the home believed Beck and Lord Janner were friends.  It is possible that Lord Janner's visits to see Beck were professional in nature.  However, a former official at Leicestershire County Council, who asked not to be identified, told the BBC that when he twice raised concerns about Beck's methods, the care home manager used the Labour peer to justify his actions.  ""Beck used Janner's name to achieve whatever Beck wanted to achieve,"" he said."
416,"At the Court of Appeal in London, Lord Justice Phillips, Mr Justice Jowitt and Mr Justice Moses also dismissed his appeal against his six-year jail sentence.  Oyston, 64, dressed in a dark blue suit with an orange handkerchief in his breast pocket, sank low in the dock as the decision was announced.  The former chairman of Blackpool Football Club was convicted by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court in May last year at the end of an 18-day trial.  He had denied raping and indecently assaulting a former model in the early 1990s when she was 16.  The trial judge, who said he had committed ""horrendous"" crimes against the girl, jailed him for six years.  After the ruling was delivered, the judges agreed that Mr Oyston should pay _100,000 costs which are to be taxed."
417,"The Authority has written to four stations in which he is believed to have a controlling interest saying he should not hold the licences.  These are The Bay, in Morecambe, Lancashire, and three stations in Northern Ireland - Belfast's City Beat 96.7, Heart Beat 1521 in Craigavon and Gold Beat in Cookstown. They have until the end of the month to respond.  Oysten's wife, Vicky, a former Miss Blackpool, has been acting as chairperson of the group of companies since he was jailed.  If the Authority concludes that Oyston retains controlling interest in the stations, their licences could be withdrawn and ultimately re-advertised."
418,"In an annual keynote speech, he said the move was needed ""in order that the imperial throne be continued into the future in a stable manner"".  Under existing rules only men are allowed to become emperors, but no boys have been born into the imperial family for 40 years.  Mr Koizumi also vowed to improve relations with China and South Korea.  ""While there may be differences in opinion or disputes in certain areas, China and South Korea are very important neighbours,"" he said.  Speaking at what could be his last annual address at the opening of the Japanese parliament, Mr Koizumi said the government would submit a bill to reform the Imperial Household Law.  He did not provide details of the proposal, or when it would be submitted. But he said it would be in line with the conclusions of a government panel which last year recommended letting women inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne.  If the change goes ahead, it would pave the way for Emperor Akihito's four-year-old grand-daughter, Aiko, to become second in line to the throne after her father, Crown Prince Naruhito, the present heir.  Crown Prince Naruhito and his wife Masako have not yet had a son. Masako, 42, has partially withdrawn from public life due to a stress-related illness, said to be partly induced by the pressure on her to produce an heir.  Opinion polls in Japan suggest a majority of people think that women should be allowed on the throne.  But some conservatives - including Prince Tomohito, a cousin of Emperor Akihito - have opposed the idea, suggesting instead the crown prince use concubines to produce a male heir.  In Friday's speech, Mr Koizumi also said he wanted to debate holding a national referendum on revisions to Japan's pacifist constitution.  He also touched on other issues, including his country's frayed relations with South Korea and China.  Beijing and Tokyo have been engaged in a number of disputes over the past year, both over oil resources and Japan's attitude to its colonial and wartime history - an issue which also annoys Seoul.  Mr Koizumi said that while there may be differences between the neighbours, ""we will strengthen co-operation from a comprehensive standpoint to construct future-oriented relations based on trust"".  Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso, a possible contender to succeed Mr Koizumi as prime minister, echoed these sentiments.  ""Developing Sino-Japanese relations is one of our country's basic foreign policies,"" Mr Aso is quoted as saying.  Mr Koizumi has said he will step down as prime minister in September at the end of his four-year term as head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party."
419,"EastEnders actor Dean Gaffney is to leave the BBC One soap, the show's producers have confirmed.  A BBC spokesman said the decision was a ""mutual one"", taken by producers, writers and actors last week.  He refused to comment on speculation that the actor's departure came after a row over storylines, adding the door will be left open for Gaffney to return.  A spokesman said his character had ""provided hours of entertainment"" for viewers.  Gaffney joined the EastEnders cast in December 1993 as teenage tearaway Robbie Jackson, who now spends his days sweeping up around Albert Square.  Co-star Bindya Solanki, who plays Robbie's partner Nita, has also been dropped from the show.  Executive producer Louise Berridge said: ""Dean and Bindya have contributed an enormous amount to the programme.  ""However, we feel that the characters have reached the end of their natural course in the show.""  Both actors will leave the show in Spring 2003.  ""It is always sad to say goodbye to a good double act and especially to a long-running character like Robbie Jackson, so we will be leaving the door open for both characters,"" she added.  ""I would like to thank Dean for his devotion to EastEnders and Bindy for transforming our loveable loser into a winner at last.  ""They will both be personally greatly missed by the cast and crew."""
420,"A team of scientists have said they believe an old gourd contains the blood of French King Louis XVI.  The monarch was killed by guillotine by French revolutionaries more than 200 years ago, on 21 January 1793.  The scientists said the DNA is very similar to genetic material from what is believed to be the mummified head of an earlier French king, AFP reports.  After Louis XVI's beheading many spectators were reported to have dipped their handkerchiefs in his blood.  The piece of fabric had been placed in a dried, hollowed-out gourd, leaving blood stains.  The squash was decorated with images of revolutionary heroes and the words: ""On January 21, Maximilien Bourdaloue dipped his handkerchief in the blood of Louis XVI after his decapitation"".  The revolutionary souvenir has been in the hands of an Italian family for a century.  The team of experts from Spain and France has published its findings in Forensic Science International journal.  Analysis of DNA taken from blood traces found inside the vegetable container had already revealed that it probably matched someone of Louis' description but scientists could not prove it belonged to the beheaded king as they had no genetic material from any of his relatives.  However, the team managed to find a rare genetic signature shared with DNA from a mummified head believed to belong to Louis' 16th Century predecessor, Henri IV, who was killed in 1610.  In 2010, scientists said the head belonged to Henri IV, saying it shared the same physical features as those illustrated in contemporary portraits of the king.  French forensic pathologist Philippe Charlier told AFP that the study revealed that both of those sampled ""share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line. They have a direct link to one another through their fathers"".  Co-author of the report, Carles Lalueza Fox, of the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva in Barcelona, was quoted as saying that it was ""about 250 times more likely that the [owners of the] head and the blood are paternally related, than unrelated""."
421,"A major redevelopment of an historic park close to the centre of Ipswich is near completion.  More than £3m has been invested in Christchurch Park by the Heritage Lottery Fund, with another £1.4m coming from the borough council.  Work has included a new pavilion and paths, restoration of Brett Fountain, creating a bird reserve and a new-look Round Pond.  The park in Suffolk is expected to be officially opened next month.  Christchurch was the first public park in Ipswich, opening in 1895.  It is home to Christchurch Mansion, which contains the Wolsey Art Gallery."
422,"Thordarson had been in charge at Meadow Lane since May last year and County ended the season just three points above the relegation zone.  Earlier in the day, Thordarson's assistant Ross MacLaren had also left the club by mutual agreement.  County chairman Jeff Moore said: ""We acknowledge the work Gudjon has done for us in difficult circumstances.""  Thordarson, who has managed the Iceland national team, has also been in charge of Stoke and Barnsley.  He originally took charge of Stoke in November 1999 but left the club in May 2002 just five days after leading them to victory in the Division Two (now League One) play-off final.  Just over a year later he took over at Oakwell but in March 2004 he was replaced by Paul Hart after a miserable run saw the club pick up just eight points from 11 matches.  When he signed a three-year contract as Notts County boss last May, he became their sixth manager in five years.  During the season he was linked with a move to Leicester and he had been making changes to the squad before his sudden departure."
423,"McLaren have ""serious concerns"" over whether they can win the world championship with engine partner Honda, says executive director Zak Brown.  The former world champions are facing their worst ever season after failing to register a single point so far in 2017 after a series of engine failures.  Brown said engine upgrades promised for Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix were not ready and the team is ""near our limit"".  ""Honda's working very hard but they seem a bit lost,"" he told Reuters.  ""We were eagerly awaiting this upgrade as were our drivers and it's a big disappointment that it's not coming.  ""It's not lack of effort, but they are struggling to get it to come together.""  Brown, who replaced Ron Dennis at the McLaren helm last year, added: ""Our preference is to win the world championship with Honda.  ""But at some point you need to make a decision as to whether that's achievable. And we have serious concerns.  ""Missing upgrades, and upgrades not delivering to the level we were told they were going to, you can only take that so long. And we're near our limit.  ""We're not going to go into another year like this, in hope.  ""There's lots of things that go into the decision and we're entering that window now of 'which way do you go when you come to the fork in the road'.""  McLaren's renewed partnership with Honda in 2015 was billed as a return to the glory days of their collaboration in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna dominated.  Yet McLaren remain without a race win since 2012 and their best finish this season was when Fernando Alonso, who started seventh on the grid, came 12th in last month's Spanish Grand Prix.  In March it was revealed McLaren had made an exploratory approach to Mercedes about engine supply in the wake of problems with Honda.  And Brown again raised the prospect of McLaren paying for engines in future.  ""Do I think you can win with a customer engine? I think you can,"" he said."

425,"Editor Radio 4 Interactive, Rhian Roberts' blog was originally published on Media.info on 11 December about Radio 4's plans to dramatise War and Peace in its entirety on 1 January 2015, and tweet along at the same time.  I’m sitting at my desk looking at my copy of Tolstoy’s epic.  It’s a doorstop of a book, actually it’s a small door of a book; fat with historical footnotes and paragraphs of translation. People who know this sort of thing say it’s the best book ever written; 42 castaways on Desert Island Discs named it as their one book.  Once I’d decided to finally take the challenge it still took me three visits to the bookshop. I was apprehensive. I circled it several times before taking a deep breath and getting my money out, and I’m a voracious reader.  The world is divided into people who feel they really ought to have read it, those who smugly have and Andrew Marr - who apparently reads it once a year.  So Radio 4 devoting the New Year’s Day schedule to a 10 hour dramatisation of War and Peace (with John Hurt) is a gift to human kind. You don’t actually have to read it, you can experience it via the magic of radio and if you’re unwilling to spend ten hours on January 1st with only a radio for company it’s being repeated on the following 10 Saturdays in hourly segments. Then there’s always the download. We have ways of making you listen.  For many it will still feel like a bit of a stretch. ‘Tolstoy? Really? That’s so the century before last…’. So the challenge for the Radio 4 digital team was how do we make it this century? How do we allow people to experience the book in a way that suits them?  So we decided to tweet it. For 10 hours. You don’t have to read the book at all, just live it through Twitter. The Radio 4 feed will be devoted to War and Peace on January 1st. We’ve got together with some of the best writers on twitter in the shape of David Schneider and his company, That Lot. We’re aiming for a playful companion to the book; with enough plot to make sense of what’s happening and enough commentary to keep you entertained. We’ll throw in some lovely family trees, maps and battle plans so no one gets lost along the way.  Don’t worry if you know you won’t surface until halfway through the day you’ll be able to catch up quickly with the story so far via the Radio 4 website where we’ll pull together all our social media activity as the day progresses. We couldn’t have made it any easier for you.  It might be the first New Year resolution you’ve ever kept."
426,"Yasser Abed Rabbo is a top aide to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and a member of the team currently negotiating with Israeli officials.  He said the Palestinians deserved independence more than Kosovo.  His comments come a day after talks between Mr Abbas and Israeli PM Ehud Olmert closed without visible progress.  The meeting is the latest in a series between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators and leaders, which was set in motion at a US-sponsored peace conference three months ago.  The aim, declared by US President George W Bush, is to achieve a peace deal by the end of 2008.  Militant activity in Gaza and Israeli plans to build hundreds more homes for settlers in the West Bank appear to have hampered the process.  ""If things are not going in the direction of actually halting settlement activities, if things are not going in the direction of continuous and serious negotiations, then we should take the step and announce our independence unilaterally,"" Mr Abed Rabbo told Reuters.  ""Kosovo is not better than us. We deserve independence even before Kosovo, and we ask for the backing of the United States and the European Union for our independence,"" he added.  But another negotiator and senior official, Saeb Erekat, disagreed arguing that the Palestine Liberation Organisation had already declared independence in 1988.  ""Now we need real independence, not a declaration. We need real independence by ending the occupation. We are not Kosovo. We are under Israeli occupation and for independence we need to acquire independence,"" Mr Erekat said.  On Sunday, Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo declared independence, in a move that has been welcomed by the US and some leading European states.  Also on Wednesday, a leading newspaper and peace campaigners in Israel reported that a Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Ramallah was being expanded in contravention of commitments by the Israeli government.  The reports say 27 mobile homes are being built at the Eli settlement, and work is under way to connect them to utilities.  The Israeli government has not commented specifically on Eli, but said it was committed to its obligations under the road-map peace plan not to expand existing settlements.  Palestinian officials have repeatedly called on Israel to stop all settlement activity, which they say damages the prospect of reaching a peace deal.  In Jerusalem on Tuesday, Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas met, accompanied by top negotiators, for dinner before the two leaders held one-on-one discussions.  Little is known about what transpired, but Mr Erekat told the AFP agency that discussions ""were deep, and tonight the prime minister and the Israeli delegation upheld their obligation to negotiate all final status issues"".  In the days ahead of the meeting, Israeli and Palestinians disagreed over whether the issue of the status of Jerusalem should be left to the end of the talks process.  Senior Israeli officials have been briefing the press that the subject of Jerusalem was not raised by either side.  Jerusalem is among the thorniest issues in peace talks. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their state, but Israel claims exclusive sovereignty over the whole city."
427,"Leonardo da Vinci's 500-year-old masterpiece now hangs alone on a wall in the museum's Salle des Etats.  It will give the millions of people who come to see the Mona Lisa every year a better view of the painting.  The Salle des Etats has had a 4.8m euro (£3.29m) renovation to provide a suitable home for the masterpiece.  It will allow visitors more room to gaze in comfort on the Mona Lisa, which will be hung alone on a false wall in an area dedicated to 16th-century Italian paintings.  The painting, which measures just 53 by 76 centimeters (21 by 30 inches), is still hung behind non-reflective, unbreakable glass to protect it from climatic changes, camera flashes and wilful damage.  Before the renovation work, visitors had to crowd around the painting which was hung in a smaller space on a wall with other works of art.  The painting - which is the most recognised in the world - is thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of an obscure Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo.  Cecile Scaillerez, Louvre curator in charge of 16th century Italian art, said: ""The painting abolishes the distance between the model and the viewer by getting rid of a foreground, which created a barrier in pictures of the time.  ""On the other hand, Lisa Gherardini isn't just looking at us, which wasn't usual in the portraits of the 15th and early 16th centuries in which people were often looking away far into the distance, but she is also smiling.""  Last year, curators announced a scientific study of the Mona Lisa after the thin poplar wood panel around the painting began to show signs of warping."
428,"The Australian, 39, only joined Bath last month, having spent four years on the coaching staff at Stade Francais.  But having impressed in his short time at the club, Meehan could see his new role become permanent according to Bath chief executive Bob Calleja.  ""Steve has already demonstrated that he has the leadership skills necessary for this role,"" Calleja said. ""This is a great opportunity for him.""  Bath recently appointed New Zealander Mark Bakewell, who has worked in Australia and France, as their new forwards coach.  They now hope to appoint a defence and skills coach as soon as possible to complement the Antipodean duo.

429,"Plans for the redevelopment of Bath Rugby's Recreation Ground stadium have been unveiled.  The club appointed a team of architects and consultants to work on the proposal earlier in the year.  Improvements could see a revamp of the west stand and north terrace, a removable east stand and an extended south stand.  Chief executive Nick Blofeld said making the plans public is a ""major milestone"".  He said: ""We have been working towards these proposals for a long time, and our aim has always been not only to provide excellent facilities for our team and fans, but for other users of the Rec too.""  The plans will go on display to the public at an exhibition over the weekend.  For those unable to attend, details can be found at the Bath Rugby website.  Architect Simon Pugh-Jones said: ""We believe the design expresses and celebrates the festival spirit of match days; brings new life and activity to the Recreation Ground and the riverside, and that draws from, and contributes to, the rich cultural and historic context of the city.""  Earlier in the year, the Charity Commission granted the Recreation Ground Trust the power to make a decision over the granting of a new lease to the club.  Bath are seeking the lease so they can redevelop the stadium to Premiership Rugby standards.  However, planning permission for the redevelopment proposal will still need to be sought from Bath and North East Somerset Council."
430,"From remote Odhi district, he warns that the cold could claim more lives unless tents are provided.  All the medical buildings here have been damaged.  There are thousands of homeless people and an acute demand for shelter. Many of the houses are destroyed and Odhi is situated at a very high altitude, so the situation is critical. It's just freezing here.  We saw children outside without any shelter. We need at least 20,000 tents here alone.  They were in extreme psychological trauma. They were desperate because they have spent four or five days in the open.  Everyone is going to Balakot but that is a dead valley now. What about the rest? We know that there are still people in villages beyond, but everyone goes to this town of ghosts.  All the agencies are now co-ordinated and united - but that doesn't mean we have what we need. We are out in the field and we see with our own eyes that things are beyond the government and the army now.  We need international aid from all over the world.  There were two major aftershocks today. I saw the mountain and it looked as if it were about to split into two. An enormous rock was precariously suspended above us.  It could have killed us.  I've seen doctors in tears. They are on the frontline and they are working with people who are dying, people without shelter, sanitation, and they cannot cope with the trauma.  But I have also seen truck upon truck of aid from ordinary Pakistani people. My UN colleagues have told me they have never seen anything like this. It makes me feel proud.  It is the one positive thing amidst all this misery.     There is not a single building standing in Balakot.  There is an extremely foul smell because the city is full of dead bodies.  We are focusing our efforts on surveys and logistics. The population of the city was about 24,000. It looks as if 70% of this population has been wiped out. Our data will help the government revise its figures.  There are a few people still alive and a Chinese agency has set up a first aid camp. Another team from UAE has taken up the job of disposing of dead bodies.  There is talk of mobilising the population that is left and spraying the rest of the area, because of contamination fears.  Tomorrow I'm going to Odhi, a place nobody has yet reached.  There are airlift helicopters dropping food, tents and medication throughout the Mansehra district: the population is very scattered over there.  I have just felt a significant aftershock. Those people who are still in remote areas must be terrified.  Their first need is shelter. Temperatures are extremely low. People now have food and medicine, but shelter is what they desperately need.  The onset of the cold has changed all our priorities.  I can see that relief supplies are coming in, but tents please, more tents.     There's a place called Jabouri, north of here. The road has been blocked by a landslide and beyond that there are many, many villages.  Let me give their names because most people won't have heard these names before: Manabocha, Jhacha, Pandur, Batangi.  People have come from these small mountain villages carrying the injured on their shoulders, walking for hours. We have heard horrific stories. The situation there is drastic.  Each village has about 250 houses, all of them are destroyed and in each home, people have died.  The government is not calculating fatalities properly. We have a survey team going to Balakot and they will establish numbers.  I have a feeling that in Balakot alone the death toll might be 15,000 or 20,000. But that is not official, these are just guesses - our team will collect data and supply it to the appropriate sources.  There are teams from all over the world and somebody has to co-ordinate them. We are going to lead them to the areas facing the direst need.  I have seen hundreds of patients here. There has been an outbreak of chest infections, respiratory tract problems here.  Supplies have only just reached here. Doctors are performing surgeries but without sterilisation equipment, surgical tools, without proper sanitation even.  Patients need to be taken to Peshawar. It has three huge hospitals waiting for patients - but they lie empty.  I'm very tired, but every hour is important.  I can see the distant mountains from here - they are covered in snow. Last night the temperature fell so low and I could only think of those people homeless outside, those villagers still trapped.     I reached Mansehra with a UN team just a few minutes ago. The roads are crowded and it was a long, arduous journey from Abbottabad.  I am standing inside the main hospital. These newly-constructed buildings were totally damaged before anyone got a chance to use them.  The patients are outside under tents. I can see some being carried in by stretcher.  One thing is clear. Medical supplies have not reached Mansehra.  People are in a terrible condition but there is not much that doctors can do. We don't really have the right surgical equipment.  There is no logistical organisation. We have no idea how many supplies are really needed, how many patients there are, how many there could be, even how many doctors are in the area.  We see Swiss and Chinese relief teams but even they are in chaos.  I have plans to head to even more remote northern areas.  I've spoken to a colleague who says that the town of Batgram has been levelled and there are serious casualties - an incredibly high death toll.  There are many dead bodies, but more importantly there are people still alive, still trapped.  One final plea is that we need helicopters urgently.     When the earthquake struck, I was in the Ayub medical complex hospital at Abbottabad.  Much of the hospital was structurally damaged during the earthquake. Ceilings caved in, the emergency room had to be closed down.  After a few moments, huge panic set in. People started to pour into the hospital.  There were people dying, being separated from families - a huge mob filled with pain. There were aftershocks, and all people could do was lie down. The casualties were enormous.  In this city alone, buildings, plazas, shopping centres just fell down.  This is a city, what is it like in the villages?  And it took well over a day for any relief to start coming. They were busy in Islamabad not thinking of the thousands of people still trapped in these rural areas.  In the evening it rained and hailed as a huge storm arrived. It was unimaginable. People were out in the cold, terrified, grieving.  There is no shelter, lots of women and children are braving the extreme weather without food and water, becoming infected by pneumonia.  The psychological trauma is difficult to cope with. We try to reassure them but what can we do when these people have nothing?  They have only their injuries. Their houses have been demolished, they have no money, no place to go.  This is a rugged and remote region. Abbottabad is a city in a valley.  From Tuesday I will venture out into the mountainous areas, where I hope to make use of my skills.   "
431,"The two tunnels which run under the River Thames between Dartford in Kent and Thurrock in Essex were closed from 0100 BST to 0600 BST on Sunday.  A simulated incident tested the emergency services, Highways Agency and local authorities in Kent and Essex.  Diversions were put in place during the five-hour safety exercise.  Northbound traffic had to leave the M25 at junction two, follow the A2 through the Blackwall Tunnel, and then take the A102 and A13 back to junction 30 of the motorway.  Vehicles over 4m (13.1ft) in height and those carrying hazardous goods had to travel clockwise around the M25 to reach their destination.  Southbound traffic using the QEII Bridge over the Thames was unaffected.  John Aspinall, from the Highways Agency, said: ""It is vital to ensure that in the case of a real emergency all the parties involved operate in an efficient manner to safeguard the public.  ""Holding Exercise Orpheus means the authorities' response to a real emergency would be swift and practiced."""
432,"The European Court of Justice has ruled motorists must pay VAT on private road tolls - despite opposition from the UK Government.  The decision would mean an increase of 17.5% on charges for using road bridges and tunnels operated by private companies, specifically the Dartford, Severn and Isle of Skye crossings.  However, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith said he had asked Customs and Excise to devise a scheme under which the government - and not motorists or operators - will bear the extra cost.  After the judgment, which the government has pledged to comply with fully, Mr Smith said: ""We have always opposed the principle of charging VAT in this area and fought hard to keep all toll charges free of VAT."" ""We are determined to protect motorists from the impact of this unwelcome ruling. ""I have asked Customs and Excise to hold urgent consultations with operators of those tolled bridges and roads affected to devise a scheme of government support to offset the cost of VAT. It will be fully funded."" The aim is to ensure businesses can reclaim the VAT so that private motorists will not have to pay more in tolls on privately run crossings. The government has interpreted the ruling as having no impact on publicly operated crossings such as the Tyne and Mersey Tunnels and the Tay, Tamar, Humber, Cleddau, Forth Road and Clifton suspension bridges. The Luxembourg judges backed a European Commission case that toll charges should be subject to VAT - a share of which is passed to Brussels as a major contribution to the European Union budget. The Treasury also faces back payments to Brussels for failing to levy the VAT, because part of all national VAT receipts must be passed to the EC as part of EU budget contributions. The payments can be claimed by the Commission as far back only as 1994, the Luxembourg judges ruled. But, coupled with the government's understanding that only three toll crossings are affected, the clawback will be minimal. ""This is not a large amount of money, particularly compared with our overall contributions to Brussels,"" said one spokesman. Ireland and France are also covered by Tuesday's ruling and the Commission is looking at bringing a similar court action against Portugal and Spain."
433,"The government has been urged to speed up plans to remove toll booths from the Dartford Crossing to ""improve growth"" in the South East.  The booths are due be replaced by an electronic charging system in October 2014.  However, business groups have said this needs to be brought forward to encourage growth.  The Department for Transport said it would introduce the new system sooner if possible.  Chairman of the South East Local Enterprise Partnership, John Spence, said the crossing was the ""greatest single barrier to growth and enterprise"" in the region.  ""At the very least we need to be assured that free-flow tolling would happen as planned in 2014, but we believe the programme can and should be accelerated significantly,"" he said.  The new system would allow drivers to pay by phone, text, online or in shops.  This is intended to speed-up traffic and reduce congestion on the crossing between Kent and Essex.  A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""We are committed to introducing free-flow charging to tackle congestion and improve journey times at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing by October 2014.  ""We shall introduce it sooner if we can.  ""This is a complex project and getting the implementation right is vital.  ""We also have to recognise this will be the first time such charging technology will be used on the roads we manage."""
434,"As the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at Dartford approaches, one man remembers what it was like to help build the famous structure.  Millions of people in south-east England have crossed the Dartford bridge. It is as well known for the length of its tailbacks as it is for the height of its imposing structure.  However, when Dennis McNally sees the bridge, he says he feels suitably ""chuffed"" as he was one of the people who helped to build the concrete pier towers central to the structure.  Originally from Newcastle, Mr McNally moved to Dartford to work on a ferry terminal project, before becoming the general foreman in charge of concreting and labour for the new bridge.  It was his job to supervise the construction of the four main piers on each side of the river. Reaching about 200ft (61m), the towers were slip formed - a procedure used for constructing large chimneys.  ""Once you start pouring the concrete, you carry on until it [the tower] is finished at the top,"" explained Mr McNally.  ""It's 24 hours a day pouring concrete - it creeps up an inch at a time and it took 10 days and 10 nights per column.""  On a clear day he could see most of Essex and Kent from the top of the towers.  He said: ""When you look at the area now it's all industrialised. When we were there it was all fields - that's all you could see.""  During one of Mr McNally's shifts up a tower on the Essex side, a World War II bomb was found on the approach road to the bridge.  ""When I looked over the side I could see the traffic for miles in both directions on the M25 and nothing was moving, the tunnel was shut and I hadn't a clue how I was going to get home when my shift finished.  ""Fortunately the fella who took over from me lived on the Essex side so he came up and I came down.  ""I had no way of getting across so I got a safety boat - it took us across and I walked up to the pub to wait until the traffic moved.""  Even as it was being built the bridge was subject of discussion and controversy.  ""When I was on the Essex side people used to complain it was called the Dartford bridge - they didn't like the idea and wanted to call it the Tilbury Bridge.  ""I said 'You can call it what you like it will be always be called the Dartford bridge' - and it is, even though it's named the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge.""  Mr McNally worked on the project for about two years.  When the towers were almost ready, because there was no scaffold, a team of specialist abseilers were brought in to go down over the sides on ropes and patch up and make good any little holes.  Mr McNally believes the new bridge was necessary at the time but now, after just 20 years, the problems at the crossing are back to what they were prior to the bridge opening.  He said: ""They built the bridge because the tunnel couldn't cope and everything was perfect for a while but now there is just too much traffic again and they need another one - preferably not in Dartford.""  However, 20 years on Mr McNally still remains proud of his involvement with the bridge.  ""When I see it I think 'I helped to build that' and so does everybody else in the family. In fact it's known as Den's bridge."""
435,"US jazz composer, arranger and pianist Clare Fischer has died, aged 83.  The Grammy winner had been on life support earlier this month after suffering a cardiac arrest following minor surgery.  Fischer received his 11th Grammy nomination at this year's awards, for best instrumental arrangement for his track In the Beginning.  Starting out in jazz, he went on to create arrangements for pop stars including Prince and Michael Jackson.  Born on 22 October 1928 in Durand, Michigan, Fischer worked with jazz legends such as Donald Byrd and Dizzy Gillespie.  In 1975 he found a new direction in Latin-American music and started his own group, Salsa Picante.  The group's record 2+2 won Fischer his first Grammy in 1981, and again in 1986 for Free Fall.  He also took on orchestral arrangements for the Chaka Khan-led group Rufus, as his nephew was the drummer.  ""Apparently the arrangements I made for their early records were appreciated, for in the following years I was hired almost exclusively by black artists,"" he told Artist Interviews.  Once he was established as an arranger in the R&B field, Fischer became the ""go-to-guy"" for arranging pop albums and was hired by artists including Paul McCartney, Celine Dion and Robert Palmer.  A multi-instrumentalist, Fischer also received an honorary doctorate from Michigan State University in 1999 for his outstanding contributions to the field of jazz.  He recorded more than 45 albums and has arranged, composed or played on more than 100 other artists' records.  He is survived by his wife Donna, and children Brent, Lee and Tahlia."
436,"Garrett, 44, was commended by the judge at LA Superior Court for his decision and his release from jail was ordered.  On Wednesday he pleaded not guilty to possession of heroin stemming from an arrest on 14 December.  His first film was 1969's Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and his hits include I Was Made for Dancing and Surfin' USA.  The performer pleaded guilty in March to attempted possession of cocaine-based narcotics stemming from a 2004 arrest, and was placed in drug treatment.  After he failed to appear in court last month for a status report a warrant was issued for his arrest.  He had previously had been ordered into drug treatment, which he failed, but the spokeswoman said his new programme would be ""much more intense"".  ""It's frequent testing and daily counselling"" and lasts a minimum of a year, she said.  Garrett has appeared in 36 films, mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, and has released 10 albums."
437,"Slipknot closed the first of three nights of rock and heavy metal at Download Festival.  Front man Corey Taylor had to stop the band's set twice saying the safety barriers had come down.  Download festival organisers have told Newsbeat that the barriers were not pushed over.  In a statement, they said: ""Their set was briefly stopped in order to ask fans to step back when the crowd surged forward.""  During the short stoppages, Taylor told the crowd: ""No-one is getting hurt on my watch, I'm not going to let that happen to my family.""  Slipknot were on stage for nearly two hours and played many of their greatest hits including Psychosocial and Surfacing.  They also paid tribute to former bassist Paul Gray, who died in 2010, by performing Duality.  The Iowa metal band last performed at the festival four years ago.  ""It's just one of those festivals that sticks out, "" said drummer Shawn Crahan, who is also known by his stage name, Clown.  ""It's kind of like a family thing, so it is always nice to come back.""  There was a huge crowd for Bullet For My Valentine, who played just before Slipknot.  Earlier in the day, they told Newsbeat they would put Slipknot to shame with their on stage pyrotechnics.  ""We've got more fire than Lucifer himself,"" said Jason James the bassist.  The band admitted it was intimidating to be performing right before one of the biggest metal acts in the world.  ""Going on before Slipknot scares me,"" said guitarist Michael Paget.  ""But we are a UK band so we should be safe.""  Other bands performing on the opening day at Donington Park included We Are The Ocean and Asking Alexandria.  Eighties rockers Europe drew a big crowd and one of the biggest cheers when they played their most famous hit The Final Countdown on the second stage.  They were on the bill this year as they missed their slot in 2012 because of the problems with the mud on the site.  ""I've seen them twice now, I love them every time, it's just Download, it's the atmosphere, it's the best.""  Korn were also a big hit with fans this year and even changed a few people's minds about them.  Twenty-year-old Stacy Lawler said: ""I like them but you know I'm not really that excited by them but they just blew me away.""

438,"Thousands of people are thronging a jungle in southern Nepal to catch a glimpse of Ram Bahadur Bomjan, 17.  The boy's meditation and apparent 10-month fast attracted global attention before he vanished in March.  Bomjan's followers say he is an incarnation of Lord Buddha who was born in Lumbini, in present-day Nepal, more than 2,500 years ago.  Eyewitnesses said that a large number of people had reached the jungle in Bara district to get a glimpse of him.  The boy attracted international attention earlier this year when he was reported to have meditated for months without food.  But there has been no information about his whereabouts over the last nine months.  Eyewitnesses said that he had become thinner. The boy told the local reporters that he lived on herbs, but did not take other food.  He also carried a sword. Newspapers quoted him as saying that he kept the weapon for self-defence: ""Even Buddha was forced to arrange for his security himself,"" he was quoted as saying.  His followers say he has been meditating without food or water and is immune to fire and snake bites.  These claims have not been independently verified. Scientists were unable to examine the boy as his followers said it would disturb his meditation."
439,"The committee managing the meditation site of Ram Bomjan, 16, released video of its members purportedly meeting the boy near his village in southern Nepal.  The boy's meditation and apparent 10-month fast attracted global attention before he vanished in March.  Large numbers of devotees flocked to see him to leave offerings. A massive search operation is still under way.  The chairman of the Om Namo Buddha Tapaswi Sewa Samiti (ONBTSS), Bed Bahadur Lama, told reporters that he and his colleagues had met Bomjan about 3km (2 miles) south-west of his meditation site in Bara district on Sunday.  He said Bomjan had spoken to them for half an hour.  ""He said he would reappear after six years. He has asked monks to perform prayers in the meditation spot,"" Mr Lama told reporters.  ""I left because there is no peace here... Tell my parents not to worry,"" Mr Lama quoted Bomjan as saying.  The alleged meeting is the first news of the boy's possible whereabouts since he disappeared on 11 March. District authorities say they cannot confirm the sighting.  Bomjan's followers and security personnel have launched a massive search operation in Ratnapuri forest and surrounding areas but have so far failed to locate him.  Bomjan's followers claim he was an incarnation of Lord Buddha who was born in Lumbini, in present-day Nepal, more than 2,500 years ago.  His followers say he has been meditating for 10 months without food or water and is immune to fire and snake bites.  But these claims have not been independently verified. Scientists were unable to examine the boy as his followers said it would disturb his meditation."
440,"Locals and police searched the area in the southern district of Bara but have not been able to locate him so far.  Police have rejected reports that the young boy, popularly known as ""Little Buddha"", may have been abducted.  His followers say Ram Bomjan may have moved deep inside the forest looking for a quieter place to meditate.  Hundreds of people used to visit the area every day where the young boy was meditating.  Make-shift shops had been set up by the locals to cater to the visitors who came from different parts of Nepal and neighbouring India.  Buddhist flags were erected around the site where Bomjan was meditating.  Booklets carrying his photo and CDs sold like hotcakes in Kathmandu and other parts of the country.  His followers claimed that Bomjan did not take food or even water throughout his t10 month-long meditation.  They refused, however, to allow any independent investigation about the health conditions of Bomjan saying that ""it would disturb him.""  The authorities also did not intervene to avoid hurting local feeling.  While critics accused Bomjan's followers of fooling people, the young boy continued to hog media headlines.  Tired from the decade-old armed conflict that has already claimed more than 13,000 lives, followers of Bomjan claimed that he was an incarnation of Lord Buddha who was born in Nepal more than 2,500 years ago.  They are still hoping that Bomjan will reappear somewhere deep in the forest and continue his meditation."
441,"A meditating teenage boy in south-central Nepal is drawing the attention of scientists after attracting huge crowds in the past six months and earning himself the name Buddha-reincarnate.  They are mulling over how to examine him without disturbing his meditation.  Ram Bahadur Bamjan's friends, relatives and managers say he has been meditating without drinking water for six months now and that he will carry on for another six years until he gains enlightenment.  Siddartha Gautama, who Buddhists believe later attained Nirvana, was born in 560 BC.  Word spread quickly about the teenager and people around Ratanapuri village in Bara district began to visit Bamjan, 15, who has been sitting cross-legged in a traditional Buddha posture under a peepal tree.  Bamjan's eyes are closed and his body firm, encased in a whitish shawl.  His hair has grown long and has almost covered his eyes. Villagers say he has grown weak.  His picture has been appearing regularly in newspapers and people now look for updates on him.  Many around Bara worship him as the reincarnation of the Buddha.  The tree is festooned and the air has the smell of incense sticks.  The dramatically increased movement of people has generated economic opportunities.  Makeshift shops have sprung up and offerings in cash and kind are on the rise.  ""Almost 500,000 rupees ($7,000) have been deposited in the bank by devotees,"" says Prajapati Koirala, a senior government administrator in the area. That is apart from the donations visitors make on the spot.  Local people have formed a committee to make sure Bamjan gets the right environment to meditate and to manage the influx of visitors and the offerings they make.  The most frequently asked questions: Does he remain seated like that and meditate even at night? Does he not eat or drink at all?  Some say he has eaten nothing since he began his meditation, others that he used to take a milk-like liquid from the roots of the peepal tree at the beginning.  Most people can live without food for several weeks, with the body drawing on its fat and protein stores. But the average human can survive for only three to four days without water.  Followers of holy men and ascetics have often ascribed extraordinary powers to them, but such powers are seldom subject to scientific inspection.  But the number of people seeking real evidence here is increasing.  Under pressure, locals have asked the administration to find out the truth.  ""We have agreed to conduct a scientific examination on him,"" said the local administrator, Mr Koirala.  The challenge is to do so without touching him.  Mr Koirala said scientists from the Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology were due to arrive to conduct the examination.  It remains unclear how they will do it.  ""At least the scientists will be able to see whether he meditates the whole night or not,"" said Deekpal Chaudhary, who sells incense sticks to visitors.  Bamjan's family members say they have no idea what is going on.  His mother fainted when she found out her son had undertaken an indefinite meditation.  ""I sometimes go to see him but he does not talk to me,"" said Maya Devi Tamang.  ""I don't know what will happen to him but I know that god will help him.""  The name of Buddha's mother was also Maya Devi, a point Bamjan's devotees have stressed.  The family said Bamjan was different from his four brothers. They said he did not speak much and stayed aloof.  ""He never touched alcohol,"" said his primary education teacher, Salden Lama.  Relatives and neighbours said Bamjan undertook meditation when he returned from a tour of Lumbini, where Buddha was born, and monasteries in Pokhara in Nepal and Dehradun in India.  Friend and cousin Prem Lama remembers Bamjan saying that he did not want people to call him Buddha as he had only reached primary enlightenment.  Bamjan has spoken only a few times since he began the meditation, according to Prem Lama.  He said the first time Bamjan spoke was when a snake bit him around a month ago.  Bamjan took the incident as his second test, which he must overcome, Prem Lama said.  In the first test he was also bitten by a snake - three months after he began the meditation.  The second snake-bite episode led to increased curiosity.  After being bitten, Bamjan was said to have asked his aides to put a curtain around him.  ""In less than a week he asked us to take the curtain away,"" Prem Lama said.  Now another curtain is to be drawn around Bamjan - for the scientific examination."
442,"A Nepalese man popularly known as ""Buddha boy"" is being investigated by police amid reports he beat a group of locals for disturbing his meditation.  Ram Bahadur Bomjan has admitted to assaulting some of the local villagers in Bara district on Thursday, according to local media.  Mr Bomjan is famed for spending months in the forest without eating.  His devotees believe he is the reincarnation of the Buddha, and he says he has not eaten since 2005.  When he started his fast, he pledged he would meditate for six years, until he gained enlightenment.  Manoj Neupane, superintendent of police for Bara district, said police were sent to investigate after 17 people lodged complaints.  Those who had been injured were sent for medical checks, he told the BBC.  According to Nepal's Republica newspaper, the villagers claimed they had been looking for wild fruit and vegetables.  Mr Bomjan said he had slapped them ""two or three times"" after they came onto his platform and mimicked him, while the villagers allege they were assaulted more seriously.  ""They disturbed me while I was meditating... tried to manhandle me,"" Mr Bomjan was quoted as saying by Republica. ""I was therefore forced to beat them.""  Last November, Mr Bomjan - who is reportedly around 20 years old - campaigned against the mass sacrifice of some 250,000 animals at the Gadhimai festival in southern Nepal."
443,"A Speaker's conference is a rarely-used type of formal inquiry into the arrangements governing elections.  It is chaired by the Speaker and its membership is drawn from all of the political parties in the House of Commons.  There were five Speaker's conferences on matters to do with electoral law and electoral reform in the twentieth century, the most recent being in 1978.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown revived the practice in September 2007, announcing that a new Speaker's conference would be established to consider how to counter declining electoral turnout and boost representation of women and ethnic minorities in the House of Commons.  The first Speaker's conference, chaired by Speaker Lowther from 1916 to 1917, paved the way for the enfranchisement of women in the UK."
444,"Potato researchers at the centre in Abergwyngregyn spotted the large, brightly-coloured caterpillar devouring potato leaves in a plot of experimental plants.  The moth, featured in the Silence of the Lambs film starring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, is named after the characteristic skull and crossbones on its back.  The four-inch moth is the largest ever found in the UK and is rarely seen here.  It is more commonly found in southern Europe and north Africa.  ""A few adult moths are found each year in UK as illegal immigrants but the caterpillars are almost never seen,"" said Dr David Shaw of the research centre.  ""It is not known to breed here as the pupae do not survive our cold winters.  ""Our staff have removed the caterpillar from the trials for safe keeping and have named it Frederick.  ""But we will not know if it a Fred or a Freda until it pupates and emerges as a moth,"" he added.  ""We continue to feed it with copious quantities of potato leaves so that it can complete its life cycle.""  Dr Shaw and his colleagues are part of the Sárvári Research Trust, based at Henfaes Research Centre in Abergwyngregyn.  Luckily, the group's research technician, Debbie Evans, is also Moth Recorder for Gwynedd, so the moth's presence has been officially recorded.  A death's head hawk moth was found on an industrial estate in south Wales in May 2000.  Wildlife experts were delighted to discover the moth at the Queensway Meadows Industrial Estate in Newport, Gwent - the first time in 16 years it had been seen in the county.  It is known to enter bee hives to feed on honey where it emits a loud squeak like a queen bee."
445,"When I was formally sworn in as governor, the chief secretary said the Falklands was a tranquil and absorbing place. It was anything else but tranquil in 1982.  But I liked the islands as soon as I got there. The people were friendly. I felt very much at home.  There had been deliberate neglect of the islands.  The advice I was given before I went out was to win the confidence of the islanders, because they were very suspicious of the Foreign Office.  What was left unsaid, but was quite clear, was they wanted me to win the confidence of the islanders so that they could sell them down the river to Argentina, because the Foreign Office regarded it as an anachronism.  But in my first dispatch I said: ""There is no way we will convince these islanders that they will be better off as part of Argentina"".  Argentina never had a proper claim to the Falkland Islands. Their claim was spurious from the very beginning.  My first intimation of an impending invasion didn't come until Thursday 1 April at 3.30pm when this top secret telegram came from the Foreign Office  It was couched in typical Whitehall jargon: ""We have apparently reliable evidence that an Argentine task force could be assembling off Stanley at dawn tomorrow. You will wish to make your dispositions accordingly.""  My assistant remarked: ""Well they might have said goodbye and the best of British"".  I decided Government House would be the operational headquarters for the Royal Marines.  After I had sent my wife and son to a safer house, I told the domestic staff to go away and just take their few most valuable possessions. Nanny, our housekeeper, got her priorities right.  Off she went with a picture of the Queen under one arm and a bottle of gin under the other.  From five to six the next morning until dawn, which was 6.35, it was a very fierce fire fight. I was under my desk with my assistant. I had to make a conscious effort to think through the noise.  People say ""weren't you frightened?"" I think I would have been but I was stunned of all emotions because of the noise.  I had a little handgun and I was going to use it if they got as far as my office.  At about 6.35, the firing subsided and (Royal Marine Major) Mike Norman popped his head round the door and said: ""We've repulsed the bastards"".  I could hear some groaning and I said ""Mike, we'd better get our injured in,"" and he said: ""They're not ours, they're theirs.""  That was when I realised how close they were. There were three of them who had been shot in my wife's vegetable garden just 15 yards from where I was.  I knew I would have to give in sometime. My one anxiety was how many lives I had to lose before I gave in, and had we done enough to resist to get the response from Britain that we needed?  If I had known Maggie Thatcher as well then as I know her now I would not have had that anxiety.  I got the admiral in charge of the task force to come to me and he urged me to give the order to lay down arms.  He said otherwise I would be held responsible for any further casualties.  I did point out that it is the people who start the shooting that are to blame. But I did take his point. It was an overwhelmingly superior force.  [At 1230, the governor, wearing his plumed governor's hat, went to the town hall in Stanley to meet the Argentine general commanding the invasion]  ""There was this rather miserable little general, sallow faced, coming towards me with a fixed smile on his face. I really felt the anger surge then and I thought: ""This is just the rape of the Falkland Islands.""  I refused to shake hands with him and said: ""You have landed unlawfully on British territory and I order you to remove yourself and your troops forthwith.""  He said: ""We have taken back what is rightfully ours and we shall stay forever.""  I had to get out by 4.30 that afternoon. We were flown to Montevideo.  [Back in Britain] I didn't know anything more than the general public about what was going on. I was never invited into any of the confidential briefings at the Foreign Office. It was ridiculous.  When I went back the Falklands it was very emotional.  The islanders insisted on grabbing me by the hand and putting their arms around me. They will forever be grateful for the sacrifices people made.  Was [the war] worth it? Yes, undoubtedly so. Just look at the poor Argentines now and look at the prosperous islanders. They have done tremendously well since then.  All sorts of things have happened that couldn't have happened had it not been for Galtieri's folly.  We still have a lot of friends out there.  During the occupation we were sitting [in Britain] looking at the television to see how the islanders were getting on.  That formed a bond between us and the islanders which I think will last until we die."

After waking, the policeman said he was unable get help as his phone had run out of credit and his radio was faulty.  The inquest also heard that when the fire-brigade arrived at the farm, it had no water to extinguish the blaze.  Gen Mujuru was one of Zimbabwe's most senior politicians and married to Vice-President Joice Mujuru.  The BBC's Brian Hungwe in the capital, Harare, says his death in the fire has been the subject of much speculation and controversy.  His charred remains were found in the farmhouse in Beatrice about 80km (50 miles) south of Harare early in the morning of 16 August 2011.  The police were supposed to provide round the clock security at the homestead on the 3,500-acre (1,416 hectares) farm, our reporter says.  Mrs Mujuru, who was not at the farm when the fire took place, said the testimony of the policeman, Obert Mark, was ""really shocking"".  Mr Mark said he was sleeping at a cottage near the farmhouse when the fire broke out - and was not on patrol as expected.  Under his nom de guerre, Rex Nhongo, he was the director of Mr Mugabe's forces during the 1970s war of independence.  At independence in 1980 he took over the command of the army, before retiring and going into business 10 years later.  At the time of his death, he was believed to have been pushing for leadership renewal within Zanu-PF.  He was the only person believed to have had the stature to challenge Mr Mugabe during party meetings, our correspondent says.  The inquest into his death is expected to call more than 40 witnesses to testify."
447,"The first camera-trap photographs of the critically endangered Northwest African, or Saharan cheetah, have been obtained in an experiment in Algeria.  The images were captured as part of a project run by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Office du Parc National de l'Ahaggar (OPNA).  The animal is known with certainty to range in six countries: Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso.  But the total population may be fewer than 250 mature individuals.  It managed to identify four different Saharan cheetahs using spot patterns unique to each animal.  ""The Saharan cheetah is critically endangered, yet virtually nothing is known about the population, so this new evidence, and the ongoing research work, is hugely significant,"" said ZSL's Dr Sarah Durant.  Farid Belbachir, who is running the field survey, added: ""This is an incredibly rare and elusive subspecies of cheetah and current population estimates, which stand at less than 250 mature individuals, are based on guesswork.  ""This study is helping us to turn a corner in our understanding, providing us with information about population numbers, movement and ecology."""
448,"The Territorial Army would be renamed the Army Reserve under plans unveiled by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.  He told the BBC legislation would be needed for the change, which would also see territorials get regular Army kit, and train with full-time forces.  As part of the recent defence review, the numbers of regular soldiers is set to fall from 102,000 to 82,000, while reservists will double to 30,000.  He said the reservists would become an ""integral part"" of the Army.  Mr Hammond said he hoped that a number of those leaving the slimmed down regular forces would join the reserves and ""help change the ethos"".  Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if he was attempting to get an ""army on the cheap"", Mr Hammond said cutting the size of the regular army was ""unfortunately one of the steps we had to take to rebalance the defence budget"".  He said that it made sense for many of the support functions, like logistics, to be done by reservists because there was not such a great demand for them during peacetime.  The defence secretary said he wanted to see a name change - ""in my head they are the Army Reserve, an integral part of the regular Army"" - but added that the change would need to be approved by Parliament.  TA soldiers usually have full-time or part-time jobs and attend training sessions in their own free time. They are paid about £35 a day for each session.  They have to commit to between 19 and 27 training days a year and if they meet this commitment they get a tax-free lump sum called a bounty, which ranges from £424 to £2,098.  Travel to and from their units is also subsidised and they do not have to pay towards their kit.  Britain has had a reserve of part-time or retired soldiers - often known as yeomanry - since the Middle Ages but the system was only regularised in 1907 with the passing of legislation creating a Territorial Force.  It was mobilised just before World War I and its soldiers fought alongside regular soldiers in the trenches of northern France.  In 1920 it became the Territorial Army and in 1939 it was doubled in size as war clouds approached again.  The TA withered away during the 1960s but in 1971 it was reformed and expanded although its role remained unclear until the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.  As the regular Army became increasingly stretched in the early 21st century the TA became more important and 6,900 TA soldiers were mobilised for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  In recent years it has also supported regular troops in Afghanistan and the Balkans."
449,"The preferred location for a town's first railway station in 50 years has been revealed.  Lancashire County Council has earmarked land on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College.  The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused.  The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre.  The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council.  County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an ""exciting step forward"".  He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion.  He added: ""It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area.""  The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land.  Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961..  It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station."
450,"Police are investigating a ""network of corrupt officials"" as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption, a media inquiry has heard.  Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers told the Leveson Inquiry evidence suggested a ""culture of illegal payments"" at the Sun newspaper.  She said payments allegedly made by the Sun were authorised at a senior level.  This part of the inquiry is looking at the relationship between press and police in the light of the hacking row.  Ex-Scotland Yard senior officer Brian Paddick and former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott also gave evidence.  Earlier, the inquiry was told that the then Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was briefed by police about their investigation into phone hacking in 2006.  But counsel to the inquiry, Robert Jay QC, saidpolice told her it was not planning to extend its phone-hacking inquiry to include News of the World staffother than Clive Goodman, the reporter jailed with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2007 for illegally accessing royal aides' voicemails.  DAC Akers told the inquiry that evidence suggested that the Sun often made payments to relatives or friends of sources and that one of those arrested allegedly acted as such a conduit.  The payments being investigated were not ones that ""just involve the odd drink or meal,"" she said. They were ""regular, frequent and sometimes significant sums of money to public officials"".  Payments by journalists to public officials were identified in the ""police, military, health and government"", she said.  DAC Akers said there was some evidence of officials being put on retainers.  Over a number of years, £80,000 was paid to one individual, she said, while one journalist received £150,000 from the paper to pay sources.  ""Emails indicate that payments to sources were openly referred to at the Sun,"" DAC Akers said.  In herwritten statement, DAC Akers said there was recognition that this behaviour was illegal, with reference made to staff ""risking losing their pensions or job"", to the need for ""care"" and to the need for ""cash payments"".  DAC Akers said the vast majority of stories stemming from such payments appeared to have constituted ""salacious gossip"" rather than being in the public interest.  News Corporation chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch later issued a statement insisting the practices were ""ones of the past, and no longer exist at the Sun"".  Lord Prescott, who received a £40,000 settlement over phone hacking, was asked about the relationship between the press and News International, owner of the Sun.  He told the inquiry: ""I always thought it was wrong that politicians at the highest level were too close to Murdoch. There is always a price.  ""It's not exactly corruption and I'm not accusing them of that... I thought it gave a corrupting influence that they had too much influence and power.""  He told the inquiry of the reluctance by the Met Police to investigate phone hacking. He was told by police in 2009, after the Guardian newspaper reported the practice was widespread at the NoW, there was no evidence he had been targeted.  Detectives questioned Mulcaire about the hacking of his agent Joan Hammell in 2006, he said, but it was not until February 2011 that police told him 44 messages from him on her phone may have been intercepted, he said.  The Labour peer praised DAC Akers's inquiry, but said he was concerned police ""withheld the truth"" over the extent of phone hacking.  ""I think there is a conspiracy of silence to hide the facts and frankly I am stronger of that view in the last few months,"" he said.  Last year Lord Prescott and Mr Paddick successfully argued at a judicial review that the Metropolitan Police failed to notify them about potential hacking.  Mr Paddick, who retired from the force as Deputy Assistant Commissioner in 2007, told the inquiry that analysis of Mulcaire's computer revealed the private investigator had details about people in the police's witness protection programme, including the killers of toddler James Bulger.  ""For this information to be in the hands of Mulcaire, and by implication potentially in the hands of the News of the World, it's clearly worrying,"" he said.  He said it was difficult to see how people could have ""complete confidence"" in the phone-hacking investigation.  It might be ""better for the public perception if these matters were investigated by an outside force,"" he said.  He went on: ""There are thousands of honest decent police officers who like me are horrified by the sort of conduct that Sue Akers was talking about this morning.  ""A lot of junior officers feel very let down by their senior officers.""  Opening Monday's hearing, Lord Justice Leveson paid tribute to reporter Marie Colvin, who died during shelling in the Syrian city of Homs on 22 February.  Lord Justice Leveson said Ms Colvin's death had underlined ""the need to preserve free speech and free press"".  In his opening statement, Mr Jay said relations between News International and the Metropolitan Police were at best ""inappropriately close"".  The nature of their relationship, he said, might explain why police did not properly investigate phone hacking in 2006, or later in 2009 and 2010.  Neil Garnham QC, representing the Metropolitan Police Service, told the inquiry the decision not to put more resources into the original phone-hacking investigation had been reasonable ""because as serious as the interception of telephone calls is, it is not a matter of life and liberty"".  The Leveson Inquiry has two parts, the first of which is examining relations between the press, politicians and police, and the conduct of each.  The second part will look at the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International and other media organisations."
451,"Clever New Caledonian crows can use three tools  Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. New Caledonian crows have given scientists yet another display of their tool-using prowess. Scientists from New Zealand's University of Auckland have found that the birds are able to use three tools in succession to reach some food. The crows, which use tools in the wild, have also shown other problem-solving behaviour, but this find suggests they are more innovative than was thought. The research is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The team headed to the South Pacific island of New Caledonia, the home of Corvus moneduloides. Finding that the crows could solve the problem... was incredibly surprising    They are the only birds known to craft and use tools in the wild. The discovery that they whittle branches into hooks and tear leaves into barbed probes to extract food from hard-to-reach nooks astounded scientists, who had previously thought that ability to fashion tools was unique to primates. And further research in the laboratory and the field has revealed that New Caledonian crows are also innovative problem solvers, often rivalling primates. Experiments have shown that the birds can craft new tools out of unfamiliar materials, as well as use a number of tools in succession. 3. Long stick out-of-reach behind bars - can be reached with short stick 4. Out-of-reach scrap of meat - can be reached by long stick    To further understand how the birds perform these tasks, the University of Auckland team set seven wild crows, which had temporarily been captured and placed in an aviary, a complicated problem. The birds were presented with some out-of reach food; a long tool, which could be used to extract the food, but which was also out of reach, tucked behind the bars of a box; and a short tool, which could be used to extract the long tool, but which was attached to the end of a dangling piece of string tied to the crow's perch. In the wild, New Caledonian crows craft tools to fish for food Professor Russell Gray, from the University of Auckland, explained: ""The crows needed to understand they needed the short tool on the piece of string to get the long tool, and then use the long tool to get the food."" The seven birds were split into two groups. The first group of birds were given the chance to try out every individual step in the set-up, before they were presented with the complete multi-stage task. Professor Gray said: ""All these birds had to do was to put together things they could already do in the right sequence."" Each of the three birds managed to solve the three-stage problem on their first attempt. A second group of birds was presented with a less familiar situation. While they had previously been shown tasks where food was directly attached to string, and sticks could be used to grab out of reach food, they had never been given a situation where a tool was linked to the string or where one tool was needed to collect a second tool. However, when presented with the multi-stage task, these birds also managed to reach their treat. Meet the brains of the animal world One bird, Sam, spent 110 seconds inspecting the apparatus before completing each of the steps without any mistakes. Another bird, Casper, also completed on his first try, although he was initially puzzled by the string. The other two birds solved the problem on their third and fourth attempts. Alex Taylor, the lead author of the paper, said: ""Finding that the crows could solve the problem even when they had to innovate two behaviours was incredibly surprising."" The researchers say that the experiments are helping to shed light on how the crows are carrying out these complicated tasks. Dr Taylor said that while using or creating a single tool could be underpinned by simple learning processes, solving a set of linked problems, suggested that the basis for their innovation is much more complex. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. New Caledonian crows form part of the corvid family of birds, which also include crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays and magpies. Over the decades, these birds have been studied for their apparent intelligence. Scientists have been surprised to find western scrub jays that try to deceive their fellow birds by pretending to bury food while they are being watched, jays which perform remarkable feats of memory, and possibly even self-recognition in magpies. More recent studies have also found that rooks too are able to create and use tools - even though, unlike New Caledonian crows, they have not been seen to use them in the wild. And these birds have also surprised scientists with their problem-solving abilities - most recently, they have been shown to repeat Aesop's fable, by working out that dropping stones into water will raise its height, giving them access to some floating food. But it might not just be birds and primates with tool-using skills - in late 2009, a paper published in the journal Current Biology suggested that veined octopuses in Australia were using halved coconut shells as tools, by scooping them from the seabed, galloping off with them and then later using them as a shelter. However, some researchers debate whether this kind of behaviour fits the definition for tool-use.     "
452,"Michael Leunig said two of his cartoons were published in the Hamshahri daily with a forged comment expressing solidarity with the Muslim world.  He said the cartoons had been withdrawn after he contacted the newspaper.  Iran's competition was launched in response to the publication in Europe of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.  The Hamshahri has said it wants to test the boundaries of free speech for Westerners.  The Muhammad cartoons, first published by the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in Denmark, have caused angry protests across the Muslim world.  ""This is a fraud and hoax emanating, we believe, from Australia,"" Mr Leunig told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  He said quotes on the Hamshahri website that accompanied his two drawings were ""not my words"".  ""I've been set up horribly, maliciously, and to me it denotes what it means to stand up against this conflict and this warlike sort of state the world is in.""  The two Leunig cartoons were rejected for publication by Australia's newspaper, The Age, in 2002.  The first drawing shows a poor man with a Star of David on his back walking towards the Nazi Auschwitz death camp in 1942 with the words ""Work brings freedom"" over the entrance.  On the second, the same man is shown approaching a similar looking gate with a rifle in Israel in 2002 with the words ""War brings peace""."
453,"The ""extra lane"" scheme will be rolled out on the M6 near Birmingham following a successful trial on the nearby M42.  It aims to ease rush-hour bottlenecks, and could be extended to other motorways in the future.  Sensors detect traffic build-up, which trigger signs asking drivers to slow down and spread out.  During the trial, a 50mph speed limit was imposed while the ""extra lanes"" were in operation.  The report on the M42 trial has shown a reduction in journey times north by up to 25% and a drop in the average accident rate from 5.2 per month to 1.5.  The report also found there had been a drop in pollution around the M42, with fuel consumption down by 4% and vehicle emissions down by 10%.  But Tony Bosworth, from Friends of the Earth (FoE), disagreed there were environmental benefits: ""It's effectively motorway widening on the cheap.  ""We believe it's simply going to encourage more drivers and cause an increase in carbon dioxide.""  Ms Kelly said ""extra lanes"" would be introduced on the M6 between junctions 4 and 5 near the Birmingham NEC arena, and junctions 8 and 10A between the M5 link and the M54 motorway junction.  The expansion will cost £150m and is due to be completed by 2011.  The government is also launching a feasibility study to consider including the M1, M25, M4 and M20 in the future.  The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) said it had reservations about the changes when they were first introduced on the M42, near Birmingham.  Kevin Clinton, from RoSPA, said: ""We were concerned that if the hard shoulder is used as a running lane, if there was a major crash it may take the emergency services longer to get there.  ""Or when someone breaks down, they may not be able to get their vehicle out of the running lane.""  But Graham Bowskill, from the Highways Agency, told the BBC that the hard shoulder would not be opened to traffic if there was a broken down vehicle on it.  ""We do actually have cameras that are constantly monitoring to see whether there are any parked vehicles,"" Mr Bowskill said.  ""At the same time, we've built additional safety features into the scheme.  ""There are emergency refuges approximately every 500 metres along this section of motorway and that's where people can park safely if they break down.""  Ms Kelly said the M42 trial had been ""really impressive"", adding: ""People get from their front door to their place of work in a much more reliable time frame.  ""The safety fears that some people have haven't materialised at all and, not only that, it's good for the economy and the environment too.""  Rebecca Lush Blum, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said the success of the M42 trial in cutting congestion showed motorway widening schemes were ""very hard to justify"".  ""But managing traffic is not enough - we need to reduce it,"" she said.  ""In allowing for increased traffic levels, active traffic management ignores the real, pressing problem of too much traffic and rising C02 levels.""  Paul Watters, head of roads policy at the AA, said the M42 trial appeared to be working well although it had so far not been tested by a major incident.  ""It's a much more comfortable experience [for drivers]. They travel slower, but get to their journey destination quicker,"" he said.  Mr Watters said his organisation backed the expansion if it was done ""for the right reasons and in the right manner"".  ""We wouldn't support just taking the hard shoulder away.""  And he added: ""There is a risk that rolling it out nationally there could be skimping which would be counter-productive and even dangerous.""  The use of variable speed limits will be introduced on the M40 between junctions 16 and 3A and where it joins the M42 south of Birmingham.  Variable speed limits currently in operation on the M42 will be extended north to junction 9.  Geoff Dossetter, from the Freight Transport Association, said lorry drivers wanted to see motorways widened and new roads built, but the hard shoulder scheme was ""a sensible way of making the most of the roads network that we already have"".  ""It has made an important contribution to improving journey time reliability for commercial vehicle operators,"" Mr Dossetter added.  ""Replicating the scheme elsewhere - and quickly - clearly makes sense."""

456,"Ed Miliband has defended plans for a ""mansion tax"" on homes worth more than £2m after singer Myleene Klass said it would hit ""little grannies"".  The Labour leader appeared surprised when the ex-Hear'Say star rounded on him in a debate on ITV's The Agenda.  Mr Miliband said the plan was a principled way of raising extra cash for the NHS.  But Ms Klass claimed it would hit old people living in modest homes in London rather than the super-rich.  ""For me, what is so disturbing is the name in its own right - mansion,"" she said.  ""Immediately you conjure up in your head these Barbie-esque houses... but in London, which is where 80% of the people who are going to be paying this tax actually live - the South East of England - have you seen what that amount of money can get you? Often it's like a garage.  ""When you do look at the people who are going to be suffering this tax, it's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time.  ""The people who are the super-super-rich who are buying their houses for £140m, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they've got their tax rebates and their amazing accountants.  ""It's going to be the little grannies that have lived in those houses for years and years.""  Mr Miliband replied that he understood ""that people don't like paying more in tax"", but he said the plan would raise £1.2bn: ""The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.  ""I say bring on this debate about how we're going to change our country.""  Ms Klass replied: ""Is that your only option? You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can't just point at things and tax them.  ""You need to have a better strategy and say, 'Why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?'""  Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to the US and a pensioner, also weighed into the row, telling Mr Miliband: ""You're going to screw me royally.""  Last month, shadow chancellor Ed Balls argued that Labour's proposed ""mansion tax"" would cost £250 a month for those people with homes worth between £2m and £3m.  He said owners of homes worth ""tens of millions"" and second-home owners would pay much higher rates of the ""progressive"" tax, and that the threshold would rise in line with average prices for high-value properties, not inflation.  Mr Balls said ""asset-rich, cash poor"" homeowners who do not earn enough to pay income tax at 40% would be able to defer payment of the mansion tax until ""the property changes hands"".  But several Labour MPs in London have expressed concerns about the policy.  It is one of Labour's main 2015 manifesto commitments, with the proceeds due to be used to fund the recruitment of 38,000 new GPs, nurses, midwives and other NHS professionals.  Some Labour candidates for Mayor of London in 2016 have sought reassurances from the party leadership amid concerns that the steep rise in houses prices in London in recent years will see family homes become liable for the tax.  In particular, they have called for safeguards for people on low or middle incomes who bought properties decades ago and have seen their market value rocket."
457,"The article defamed Prime Minister Lee and his father, the court found Singapore's High Court has ruled that the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER) magazine defamed Singapore's leaders. It ruled that the editor, Hugo Restall, also defamed Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loong. The case was about an article in FEER in 2006, based on an interview with Singapore politician Chee Soon Juan. The Singapore government has frequently resorted to its own courts to protect its reputation. Singapore state media reported that Justice Woo Bih Li had reached his conclusion of defamation by summary judgement, as requested by the Lees. In such a judgement, the court makes a ruling without the case going to trial, as it agrees with the applicant that the defence arguments are baseless, the Straits Times newspaper added. Damages are to be assessed later. FEER has a month in which to lodge an appeal. The Straits Times reported that lawyers for the Lees had said the article at the centre of the case was ""calculated to disparage both leaders by suggesting they were corrupt and unfit for office, and would sue and suppress those who questioned them as the questions would expose their corruption"". The article which had aroused the Lees' anger was entitled Singapore's 'Martyr,' Chee Soon Juan. It described the Singapore Democratic Party secretary general's battle against the ruling People's Action Party and its leaders. FEER had argued that the article was based on facts and fair comment, concerned matters of public interest and was a neutral report. But Justice Woo said FEER's defences failed or did not apply in Singapore, the Straits Times said. He said there was no doubt the defamatory words in the article referred to the two Singapore leaders, and that other references that linked the government to Singapore's National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and its disgraced director TT Durai amounted to ""defamation by implication"". Justice Woo found the article to mean that Lee Kuan Yew ""has been running and continues to run Singapore in the same corrupt manner as Durai operated NKF and he has been using libel actions to suppress those who would question to avoid exposure of his corruption"", the newspaper reported. He also found the article to mean that Prime Minister Lee ""is unfit for office because he is corrupt and he too has set out to sue and suppress those who question him to cover up his corruption"". Justice Woo rejected FEER's argument that the article constituted fair comment, saying the words in question were allegations of facts and not comments. FEER's argument that Dr Chee was entitled to respond to allegations made against him by the Lees, was also rejected, as Justice Woo found the defamatory words went beyond such a response. The allegation of corruption against the Lees was ""plainly an example of someone going beyond defence and proceeding to offence"", he was reported to have said by the Straits Times. Singaporean leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in defamation cases against critics and foreign publications, which they have said are necessary to protect their reputations from unfounded attacks. Singapore has also banned several foreign publications from distributing their products in Singapore, and has required those that do distribute there to promise to abide by stringent media rules."

459,"Actor Richard Briers, best known for his role in TV's The Good Life, has died at the age of 79, his agent has said.  The star, who was also an accomplished stage actor, had been battling a serious lung condition for several years.  Briers died ""peacefully"" at his London home on Sunday, his agent added.  Briers recently blamed years of smoking for his emphysema.  ""It's totally my fault,"" he said. ""So, I get very breathless, which is a pain in the backside. Trying to get upstairs... oh God, it's ridiculous. Of course, when you're bloody nearly 80 it's depressing, because you've had it anyway.""  His agent, Christopher Farrar, said: ""Richard was a wonderful man, a consummate professional and an absolute joy to work alongside.  ""Following his recent discussion of his battle with emphysema, I know he was incredibly touched by the strength of support expressed by friends and the public.  ""He has a unique and special place in the hearts of so many. He will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and deepest sympathy go to his family at this sad time.""  In 1970s BBC sitcom The Good Life, Briers and Felicity Kendal played a married suburban couple who try a self-sufficient lifestyle.  Briers also starred in shows including Marriage Lines, Ever Decreasing Circles, Monarch Of The Glen plus a role in Doctor Who and Torchwood.  He appeared in many films, most recently in British comedy film Cockneys versus Zombies, plus a cameo role in Run For Your Wife, based on Ray Cooney's 1980s stage farce.  Briers narrated the 1970s children's cartoon series Roobarb And Custard and also provided the voice for the character of Fiver in the animated feature Watership Down (1978).  ""The nation has lost one of its most favourite actors of all time,"" said Michael Grade, who ran BBC One when Ever Decreasing Circles was on the air.  ""He was up there with Ronnie Barker and Alan Bennett. He was just a treasure. He was so warm and so gently funny, and such a truthful actor.""  Speaking to 5 live, Lord Grade added: ""If you treated him like a star, I think he got embarrassed. He was one of those wonderful, genuine, professional actors with real star quality but humility to go along with it.  ""There was nothing he couldn't do, and he always had a twinkle. You were always pleased to see him. It's just a shock and really, really sad.""  ""He is a centre-piece of our humorous culture and a magnificently talented man. I'm so deeply sad today that he has left us. He was a great person.""  Actress Penelope Keith, who played the snobbish neighbour Margo to Briers' character Tom in The Good Life, said the actor's death was ""an enormous loss"".  ""I look back with enormous affection and love for Dickie. He was the most talented of actors, always self-deprecating. I learnt an awful lot from him during our time on The Good Life,"" said Keith.  ""He was a wonderful mentor, tutor and teacher although that would suggest he imposed himself on you, which he didn't.  ""He was always courteous and he would speak to the crew - which was not always that common. And he was always nervous. It was the most enjoyable time - when I think of The Good Life, I smile.""  Briers's godson, the actor and director Samuel West, whose mother Prunella Scales was in Marriage Lines, tweeted: ""What a lot of joy he spread.""  Scales described Briers as ""very skilful, very professional, and off screen a dear friend and a very considerate colleague"".  Comedian and writer Barry Cryer told 5 live Briers had been an ""enormously popular, well-liked man"", adding he was a ""formidable actor and the most modest, you know, arrogant in his humility!"".  After a long career in popular television, Briers joined Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company in 1987, and his career moved on to major classical roles.  He said at the time: ""Ken offered me Malvolio in his production of Twelfth Night at the very time I had decided to expand my career when I realised I had gone as far as I could doing sitcoms. As soon as I worked with him, I thought he was truly exceptional.""  After playing Malvolio, Briers took on the acting challenge of King Lear, followed by the title role in Uncle Vanya and Menenius in Coriolanus.  Peter Egan, his co-star in Ever Decreasing Circles, told the BBC: ""I spent nearly 10 years just laughing. He was just the most magical comedian, a huge talent, has been a part of the nation's lives for over 50 years.  On film Branagh cast him as Bardolph in Henry V (1989), as Stephen Fry's father in the comedy Peter's Friends (1992), Don Leonato in Much Ado About Nothing (1993), the blind grandfather - playing opposite Robert De Niro's Creature - in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994).  Sir Kenneth said on Monday: ""He was a national treasure, a great actor and a wonderful man. He was greatly loved and he will be deeply missed.""  Stephen Fry tweeted: ""How sad. He was the most adorable and funny man imaginable.""  Briers was born in London on 14 January, 1934 and was inspired to be an actor by his mother, a music and drama teacher.  He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and won a scholarship to Liverpool Playhouse in 1956. Two years later he made his first West End appearance in Gilt And Gingerbread.  His big screen career began with the British features Bottoms Up (1960), Murder She Said (1961), The Girl On The Boat and A Matter of Who (both 1962) and the multi-national The VIPs (1963), followed by Raquel Welch's spy spoof Fathom (1967).  Other film credits included Michael Winner's A Chorus Of Disapproval (1989) and the big-screen version of the hit TV series Minder.  Briers returned to the stage many times in his career, and was particularly associated with the works of Alan Ayckbourn, including Relatively Speaking, Absurd Person Singular and Absent Friends.  He was formerly president of Parkinson's UK and later its honorary vice president.  ""We're really sad to hear that Richard Briers has passed away. Richard was our honorary vice president and a great supporter of Parkinson's UK,"" the charity tweeted on Monday.  Briers was awarded the OBE in 1989 and a CBE in 2003. He married the actress Anne Davies in 1956 and had two daughters with her."
460,"Ecologist Will Miles said initial research of great skua preying on Leach's petrel on St Kilda found the behaviour was unlikely to be common.  The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) has been recording ""alarming"" falls in the smaller petrels on the islands.  Mr Miles and fellow researchers used night vision gear to observe the skua.  NTS said the Leach's petrel colony on St Kilda, which it owns, is the largest in Europe and numbers about 40,000 pairs.  Researchers from Glasgow University have been investigating suggestions that great skua, or bonxie, may be eating up to 14,000 petrels every year.  The research on Hirta, St Kilda, will run until 2009.  Results of this year's work are still being analysed, however, Mr Miles revealed some intriguing insights into the bonxies' behaviour.  He said: ""The skuas are highly active on the petrel colonies at night and catch petrels in a variety of ways - both on the ground and in the air.  ""Nocturnal foraging by great skuas is thought to be quite a rare situation.  ""At least, it has not been widely reported from the most intensively studied skua colonies on Shetland or from elsewhere across the species' breeding range.  ""The situation on Kilda seems rather unique in this respect.""  Why the bonxie prey on petrels may be down to a combination of factors.  They include limited other food sources, competition between the skuas and when the birds nest close to petrel colonies.  Mr Miles said: ""Skuas are highly opportunistic predators and some individuals seem to develop a taste for certain prey types.  ""One possibility may be that on Kilda the petrels are a relatively abundant prey type, a few individual skuas have exploited this situation opportunistically and their behaviour has been copied by others looking for an easy meal.""  After assessing the safety of vantage points, the researchers spent nights close to high cliffs, steep slopes and scree boulder fields.  Mr Miles said: ""Once on-site, we then stayed put in one watching position for the hours of darkness and just observed the bird activity.""  The vigils were often to the backdrop of the sound of puffins, manx shearwaters and European storm petrels.  Mr Miles said: ""The call of the shearwaters is particularly evocative and bizarre - sometimes likened to a chicken with asthma. It is rather a wheezy, wailing sort of call.""  Mr Miles admitted it could be hard to be an impartial observer.  He said: ""Yes, Leach's petrels seem tiny and elegant seabirds when compared with bonxies, so of course it can be difficult to watch a petrel get eaten without feeling some kind of regret.  ""Predation is a normal occurrence in nature though, even if rarely observed.""  Data gathered by researchers will be used to help guide conservation efforts for both species."
461,"First aired in 2000, My Hero saw popular Irish stand-up Ardal O'Hanlon make the transition from simpleton priest Dougal in Father Ted, to simpleton superhero Thermoman - an alien from the planet Ultron.  The series adopted the well-mined 'alien adapting to life on Earth' device featured in American comedies such as 3rd Rock From The Sun, The Coneheads and Mork and Mindy.  Thermoman's alter ego is George Sunday, the proprietor of a health food shop.  In spite of his numerous superhero powers, George is a lovable buffoon whose ignorance of human life leads to frequent misunderstandings with (mildly) amusing consequences.  At the beginning of Series One, Thermoman/George falls in love with Nurse Janet Dawkins after he saves her life while she is on holiday in America.  After George tracks her down Janet falls for him too, despite some initial reservations about the whole Superhero, secret identity thing.  The show's six series see the couple marry and have babies Ollie and Cassie - super-babies who can speak from birth and have full sets of teeth, thanks to some rather unconvincing special effects.  This is all much to the dismay of George's disapproving mother-in-law Ella and her down-trodden husband, Stanley, who would prefer to have Janet's fame-obsessed boss Doctor Piers Crispin as their son-in-law.  Luckily, George has Tyler, his Scouse hippy neighbour on his side, whose bizarre ideas often exceed George's in their stupidity.  George's other confidante is fellow Ultronian and former superhero Uncle Arnie, who runs a diner in Brooklyn.  This quaint family sitcom was created by Paul Mendelson (So Haunt Me, and May To September) and proved popular amongst family audiences.  In the sixth and final series George's role was taken over by James Dreyfus (Gimme Gimme Gimme) after he loses his former human identity in a game of poker.  Despite Dreyfus's valiant efforts without the charm of Ardal O'Hanlon to carry it, ratings fell dramatically and the show was cancelled."
462,"Mother Teresa - a special calling to help the poorest Tributes have been pouring in for Mother Teresa, whose death after a heart attack was announced in India on Friday. The Vatican in Rome said Pope John Paul II was quickly informed of Mother Teresa's death, and immediately prayed for her. A Vatican spokesman said her death had touched the Pope's heart very deeply. Francis Sejerstad, the Norwegian chairman of the Nobel Committee which awarded the 1979 Peace Prize to Mother Teresa, said she had been a choice that the committee looked back on with pride. Humanitarian work, he said, had always been one of the most important criteria, and Mother Teresa had been an outstanding example of how this can be done in a self-sacrificing way. The head of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, Cardinal Basil Hume, said Mother Teresa had been a unique example of genuine holiness. Ordinary people around the world, he said, had been inspired by her unshakeable trust in God, her absolute commitment to the poor, and the strength of her love and humanity. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that in a week already filled with tragedy, the world would be saddened that one of its most compassionate servants had died. Mother Teresa's spirit, he said, will live on as an inspiration to all of us. President Clinton - who is currently on holiday in the north-eastern US state of Massachusetts - described her as an incredible person. In India itself, crowds grew outside Mother Teresa's mission -- known as the Mother House, as more and more of the poor of Calcutta came to know of the death of the nun who did so much for them. They gathered outside the house to say the last farewell to the Saint of the Gutters, as she became widely known after she relinquished more conventional forms of missionary work in the 1940s and founded her own order, the Missionaries of Charity. Mother Teresa: a special calling to help the poorest Inside the Mother House, sisters of the order, whose hallmark is a simple blue-edged white sari, said mass amid scenes of profound emotion. Mother Teresa had become increasingly frail in recent years, though she surprised everyone by undertaking a trip to Europe and the United States only three months ago, providing her with what has now turned out to be a last chance to meet the Pope. Her death came swiftly, shortly after she had complained of chest pains and doctors had been summoned urgently to the mother house. The Indian Prime Minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, led the tributes to Mother Teresa and her work within India by calling her an apostle of peace and love. Though she was born of Albanian parents, India's President, K R Narayanan, described her as particularly Indian in the true spirit of the country's culture. Such a one as her, he said, rarely walked upon the earth. When she was 18 she joined a community of Irish nuns and went to their mission in Calcutta in 1929. Just over twenty years later she founded the Missionaries of Charity -- which over the succeeding years established hundreds of orphanages, homes for the poor and other charity centres around the world. Mother Teresa was not without her critics. Some doctors accused her of providing haphazard medical care and not using basic medicines, like painkillers. Writing in the leading medical journal The Lancet in 1994, Dr Robin Fox commented: ""Mother Teresa prefers providence to planning"". In the same year, a British documentary - controversially entitled ""Hell's Angel"" - charged that she urged the poor to accept their fate, portraying the rich as favoured by God. Journalist Christopher Hitchens, who wrote the script, remarked: ""She lends spiritual solace to dictators and to wealthy exploiters...and preaches surrender and prostration to the poor."" In 1979 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, one of many honours bestowed on her. She said simply that she had a special calling to help the poorest of the poor."
463,"Dominating the town, Caerphilly Castle was constructed in the late 13th century, and is the largest castle in Wales. It was built principally to stop the advance of Prince Llwelyn ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd by the nobleman Gilbert de Clare.  The 5th Marquess of Bute presented the sandstone castle to the British Government in 1950, since when it has undergone much restoration as a tourist attraction and as a venue licensed for weddings.  The residential quarters of the East Gatehouse, Constable's Hall and Broase Gallery were used by the BBC Wales team for a day's recording at the medieval venue on Monday 27 April 2009. Actress Alexandra Moen took centre stage, reprising her role of Lucy Saxon - the one-time wife of the Master - for her brief appearance in the tenth Doctor's finale, The End of Time.  The scenes of the Master's resurrection in the dungeon of Broadfell Prison were the main focus for the day - although John Simm was not present as the Master, meaning the returning Time Lord's dialogue was read in by a production runner - after which various prison corridor and cell sequences with the imprisoned Lucy were taped on the cold, rainy day.  The Doctor's failure to respond to the summons of the Ood allows his arch-enemy the Master to resurrect himself, but in a feral, dying, skeletal state. Kidnapped by the wealthy Joshua Naismith who believes that he can bestow the gift of immortality on his daughter, the Master hatches a plan to turn all humanity into versions of himself. The Doctor and Wilf Mott battle to foil his scheme as events spiral out of control and the Time Lords on Gallifrey are called back into existence.  Return to the Doctor Who in Wales map."
464,"Probably the most derided politician to emerge out of the BSE scandal, John Gummer will always be remembered for making great public show of feeding his four-year-old daughter Cordelia a hamburger in the midst of the ""mad cow"" disease scare.  The press photographed Mr Gummer - then Agriculture Minister in the Conservative government - tucking into the burger with his little girl at a boat show in Suffolk on May 6 1990.  Just six days before, it had emerged a cat had died of a BSE-like disease and six months earlier the government itself had banned beef offal for human consumption.  Eight years passed - and 32 people had died of CJD, the human form of BSE - before Mr Gummer was obliged to justify his action to the public inquiry on BSE.  In December last year, he told the panel he had no regrets about his strenuous efforts to appease public fears with blanket statements that beef was ""perfectly safe"".  Families of CJD victims accused him and the government of whitewash. But Mr Gummer, a committed Christian and son of a well-known Church of England clergyman, insisted he always acted in the best interest of the consumer - using his own family as a benchmark.  ""Adults, about themselves, may take a certain kind of risk,"" said the father of four. ""They smoke and of all sorts of things. The only fair question, I think, before I made a comment to the public was that I thought this was safe for my children to eat.""  He also told the inquiry he had delayed a ban on beef offal in 1989 because he did not believe it was ""essential for public health"" because the Southwood report on the issue had only suggested a ban.  At the end of the hearing, the panel asked him if the BSE crisis had changed his eating habits. He told them that if anything he ate more beef because it was cheaper that it used to be.  The burger episode turned him into a figure of fun and led to a lasting public mistrust of government pronouncement on food scares - notably Tony Blair's reassurances on genetically-modified food.  The MP for Suffolk Coastal remained Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food until 1993 when he was made Secretary of State for the Environment until Labour took power in 1997.  Now on the backbenches, he is regarded as one of the ""greenest"" Conservatives with strong views on on global warming and town planning."
465,"Detectives searching for a girl who went missing in the 1940s are resuming their excavation of the garden of a house that belonged to a man later convicted of rape. Six-year-old Sheila Fox vanished 57 years ago - in August 1944 - after leaving her school in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Richard Ryan, a 20-year-old man who was later convicted of rape, lived at the property in Barton Road, which was on the route between Sheila's school and home.    We have a duty to the family to find out what happened    No trace of her was found despite a massive search by special constables, air raid wardens and neighbours. Police re-opened the investigation after a witness, who was a young child at the time, came forward to say he had seen a man digging a hole in the back garden of a nearby house at midnight. The neighbour, who is now in his 70s, said it had preyed on his mind, but he had not wanted to lead police on a ""wild goose chase"". Sheila disappeared as she made the short journey from St James' Primary School to her home on Macdonald Avenue. She was last seen riding on the crossbar of a bike with a man who had befriended her. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Buchanan, who is leading the inquiry, said the excavation would be a ""slow and painstaking process"" which would last several days. He said: ""The disappearance of Sheila has remained a mystery for over 50 years and this is the first piece of information we have received in that time relating to her whereabouts. ""It is very early days for this line of inquiry and at this stage I don't want to speculate whether or not we will be successful in our search for Sheila."" Police said they hoped the operation might jog the memories of residents who might have information about the girl's disappearance. Officers stressed that the current owner of the house moved to the property long after 1944 and was not connected with the inquiry. Mr Buchanan went on: ""We have a duty to the family to find out what happened. The whereabouts of this little girl are still not known. ""The family are still clearly traumatised by her disappearance."" Sheila's older sister Rene, 69, who was told about the lead last month, said: ""I've hardly been able to sleep properly after I found out about it. I hope to God she is there so I will at least know where she is then."" She told the Bolton Evening News: ""I will be so glad if they do find her because it was so sudden. It left us all feeling so empty. ""It was a terrible time. We never even found her shoes or a ribbon. It was just as if the earth had swallowed her up."" Neighbour Ann Howarth, 54, said her aunt, Linda Neary, who died when in her 80s, lived next door to Sheila Fox's family.    It was just as if the earth had swallowed her up    She said: ""They always said at the time that Sheila was killed by someone she knew. She was so timid and soft she would not have gone with a stranger."" He moved from the house in 1948, then in 1950, six years after Sheila's disappearance, he was convicted of rape. In 1965 he was charged with indecently assaulting a child."
466,"               Sidney Cooke is regarded as a dangerous and predatory paedophile who even at the age of 72 remains a constant threat to youngsters.      He has been given two life sentences for a catalogue of crimes involving the systematic rape and abuse of two brothers over several years.      But these horrific admissions are just one of a series of depraved acts the persistent offender has committed during the past three decades.      In his job as a fairground worker, Cooke was able to travel the country preying on vulnerable youngsters.      Known by colleagues as Hissing Sid, he set up his children's 'Test Your Strength' machine at fairgrounds around the country using the opportunity to meet boys and lure them into depraved homosexual orgies.     Sexual torture      With his sick friends Robert Oliver, Lennie Smith and Leslie Bailey, he would drug the children before subjecting them to brutal assaults.      Cooke, who habitually dressed in a filthy suit and trilby hat, was one of a 1980s gang suspected of being responsible for the killing of up to nine young boys during sex orgies.      Operating from a flat on the Kingsmead estate in Hackney, east London, the gang hired rent boys or snatched children off the streets and subjected them to horrific sexual torture.            ""I can't think of anything worse that could happen to a human being and a vulnerable young man    The former farm worker led the paedophile ring jailed for killing 14-year-old Jason Swift from Hackney, East London, in 1984.      A gang of men each paid £5 to have sex with Jason in the ""stinking, filthy"" flat they used on the Kingsmead.      A few hours later he was dead. His body was found in a shallow grave on the outskirts of London.     'Evil man'      Detective Superintendent David Bright, who was involved in the hunt for the killers of the teenager, said: ""I can't think of anything worse that could happen to a human being and a vulnerable young man.      ""Cooke is a very hard and resilient man. He's a very strong character but he's an evil man.""      Cooke was sent to prison for 19 years in 1989 for Jason's manslaughter but later managed to get his sentence reduced to 16 years by appeal court judges and was released after just nine in 1998.      He convinced the judges that Leslie Bailey was the evil genius and the mastermind behind the gang.      Cooke, however, was named by Bailey as one of the killers of seven-year-old Mark Tildesley, who vanished in June 1984.     Grieving parents      Mark disappeared after visiting a funfair near his home in Wokingham, Berks.      His bicycle was recovered nearby but no trace of him has ever been found. Police believe he was lured away from the fair by Cooke for the promise of a 50p bag of sweets before being tortured and killed by Cooke's gang in a caravan.      Cooke has indicated he knows where Mark's body is buried but refuses to tell police or the boy's grieving parents exactly where his grave is.            The children who were abused by Sidney Cooke suffered some of the vilest and cruellest sex offences imaginable    In 1991 the Crown Prosecution Service declined to prosecute Cooke for Mark's murder.      During his time in London's Wandsworth prison Cooke was admired by other paedophiles for the extent of his depravity and the lengths he was prepared to go to ensnare his victims.      Angry protests had greeted his release from prison last year and he was forced to keep on the move as soon as his identity was discovered.      He eventually lived, at his own request, in a suite of three cells at Yeovil police station in Somerset where the Home Office provided him with a TV, washing machine, microwave and small cooker.      Nearly a year after his release, Cooke was arrested at the police station by Thames Valley Police detectives investigating allegations of rape and other serious sexual offences which had come to light after the Channel 4 documentary, Dispatches.      Following his sentencing, NSPCC director Jim Harding said of the sentence: ""The children who were abused by Sidney Cooke suffered some of the vilest and cruelest sex offences imaginable.      ""He should never have been freed after serving his last sentence. We sincerely hope he will never be given the opportunity to hurt another child again."""
467,"A fishing boat found empty and gutted by fire in the South Pacific is to be towed back to its home port in Taiwan.  Hopes of finding its 29 Asian crew members alive are fading, an official said on Tuesday.  The scorched shell of the Tai Ching 21 was found near Kiribati on 9 November with no sign of the crew members.  The crew are from Taiwan, China, Indonesia and the Philippines, but news reports were unclear if the boat was Korean or Taiwanese.  Fiji Navy Warrant Officer Anare Rasunusunu said the boat was being towed back to Taiwan, and ""from there they will make an assessment and investigation"".  There was virtually no chance of finding the men alive, he said.  The search, called off on the weekend, was first made by a US Air Force C-130 Hercules, and followed up by a New Zealand Air Force Orion aircraft.  It spent more than 30 hours searching 21,000 square miles (54,000 square kilometres) of sea in the Pacific Ocean north of Fiji, to no avail.  Mr Rasunusunu said the Tai Ching 21 had not sent a mayday call and it was not known what food, water or survival gear was in its three life rafts or one lifeboat, which had also not been found.  The last radio transmission from the vessel - a personal call on a satellite phone from the captain to his wife in Taiwan - took place on 28 October.  A Korean fishing crew found the deserted vessel drifting near Kiribati's Phoenix Islands 12 days later.  The ship was not smoking, indicating the fire had gone out several days earlier, said Mr Rasunusunu.     "
468,"The disappearance of Rome's Ninth Legion has long baffled historians, but could a brutal ambush have been the event that forged the England-Scotland border, asks archaeologist Dr Miles Russell, of Bournemouth University.  One of the most enduring legends of Roman Britain concerns the disappearance of the Ninth Legion.  The theory that 5,000 of Rome's finest soldiers were lost in the swirling mists of Caledonia, as they marched north to put down a rebellion, forms the basis of a new film, The Eagle, but how much of it is true?  It is easy to understand the appeal of stories surrounding the loss of the Roman Ninth Legion - a disadvantaged band of British warriors inflicting a humiliating defeat upon a well-trained, heavily-armoured professional army.  It's the ultimate triumph of the underdog - an unlikely tale of victory against the odds. Recently, however, the story has seeped further into the national consciousness of both England and Scotland.  For the English, the massacre of the Ninth is an inspiring tale of home-grown ""Davids"" successfully taking on a relentless European ""Goliath"". For the Scots, given the debate on devolved government and national identity, not to say the cultural impact of Braveheart, the tale has gained extra currency - freedom-loving highlanders resisting monolithic, London-based imperialists.  The legend of the Ninth gained form thanks to acclaimed novelist Rosemary Sutcliff, whose masterpiece, The Eagle of the Ninth, became an instant bestseller when published in 1954.  Since then, generations of children and adults have been entranced by the story of a young Roman officer, Marcus Aquila, travelling north of Hadrian's Wall in order to uncover the truth about his father, lost with the Ninth, and the whereabouts of the Legion's battle standard, the bronze eagle.  The historians have dissented, theorising that the Ninth did not disappear in Britain at all, arguing both book and film are wrong. Their theory has been far more mundane - the legion was, in fact, a victim of strategic transfer, swapping the cold expanse of northern England, for arid wastes in the Middle East. Here, sometime before AD 160, they were wiped out in a war against the Persians.  But, contrary to this view, there is not one shred of evidence that the Ninth were ever taken out of Britain. It's just a guess which, over time, has taken on a sheen of cast iron certainty. Three stamped tiles bearing the unit number of the Ninth found at Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, have been used to support the idea of transfer from Britain.  But these all seem to date to the 80s AD, when detachments of the Ninth were indeed on the Rhine fighting Germanic tribes. They do not prove that the Ninth left Britain for good.  In fact, the last certain piece of evidence relating to the existence of the Legion from anywhere in the Roman Empire comes from York where an inscription, dating to AD 108, credits the Ninth with rebuilding the fortress in stone. Some time between then and the mid-2nd Century, when a record of all Legions was compiled, the unit had ceased to exist.  But what happened to the Ninth?  The early years of the 2nd Century were deeply traumatic for Britannia. The Roman writer Fronto observed that, in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117 - 138), large numbers of Roman soldiers were killed by the British.  The number and full extent of these losses remain unknown, but they were evidently significant. The anonymously authored Augustan History, compiled in the 3rd Century, provides further detail, noting that when Hadrian became emperor, ""the Britons could not be kept under Roman control"".  The British problem was of deep concern to Roman central government. Thanks to a tombstone recovered from Ferentinum in Italy, we know that emergency reinforcements of over 3,000 men were rushed to the island on ""the British Expedition"", early in Hadrian's reign. The emperor himself visited the island in AD 122, in order to ""correct many faults"", bringing with him a new legion, the Sixth.  The fact that they took up residence in the legionary fortress of York suggests that the ""great losses"" of personnel, alluded to by Fronto, had occurred within the ranks of the Ninth.  It would seem that Sutcliff was right after all.  It was the Ninth, the most exposed and northerly of all legions in Britain, that had borne the brunt of the uprising, ending their days fighting insurgents in the turmoil of early 2nd Century Britain.  The loss of such an elite military unit had an unexpected twist which reverberates to the present day. When the emperor Hadrian visited Britain at the head of a major troop surge, he realised that there was only one way to ensure stability in the island - he needed to build a wall.  Hadrian's Wall was designed to keep invaders out of Roman territory as well as ensuring that potential insurgents within the province had no hope of receiving support from their allies to the north. From this point, cultures on either side of the great divide developed at different rates and in very different ways.  The ultimate legacy of the Ninth was the creation of a permanent border, forever dividing Britain. The origins of what were to become the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland may be traced to the loss of this unluckiest of Roman legions.  Dr Miles Russell is a senior lecturer in Prehistoric and Roman Archaeology at Bournemouth University."

470,"Lord Lucan is now presumed to be dead, a High Court judge has ruled.  A death certificate has been issued 42 years after the peer vanished when his children's nanny Sandra Rivett was bludgeoned to death in London.  He was declared dead in 1999, despite dozens of unverified sightings, but the new ruling gives his son the right to inherit the family title.  His son, Lord Bingham, said: ""I am very happy with the judgment of the court in this matter.""  More on this story and other news from London  Speaking outside the court, he added: ""It has been a very long time coming.""  Ms Rivett's son, 49-year-old Neil Berriman said: ""I think [Lucan is] dead. It is fantastic and I am very pleased for [Bingham].""  Lucan disappeared the night Ms Rivett was murdered at 46 Lower Belgrave St, Belgravia, on 7 November, 1974.  He drove to a friend's house in East Sussex in a borrowed car, which was later found abandoned in Newhaven with bloodstains inside.  The mystery of his whereabouts excited decades of speculation.  Lady Lucan said at the time of the killing that her husband admitted committing the crime, although he said it was a mistake. It has been reported that she believes Lucan jumped to his death from a ferry leaving Newhaven.  The first reported sightings of Lucan occurred soon after the murder. In January 1975 he was supposedly spotted in Melbourne, Australia, and five months later he was apparently spotted in France.  Police in Cape Town went so far as to check fingerprints on a beer glass, reputedly held by the peer.  In 2012, Lucan's brother Hugh Bingham said he was ""sure"" the missing peer fled to Africa following the nanny's murder. But he then said he was unsure if his sibling was alive or dead.  The author of one book claimed an intruder murdered the nanny and attacked Lady Lucan. In another book, a former senior Scotland Yard detective said that Lucan fled to Goa where he lived a hippy lifestyle as Barry Halpin until his death in 1996.  Other ""sightings"" of Lucan located him in an ex-Nazi colony in Paraguay, a sheep station in the Australian outback, backpacking on Mount Etna and working as a waiter in San Francisco.  George Bingham had won his fight to have a death certificate issued for his father allowing him to use the family name. He now becomes Lord Lucan in addition to the eighth Earl of Lucan.  He had always said this legal process had been about gaining ""closure."" Speaking outside the High Court he accepted that some would view the title Lord Lucan as a tainted title but it was his family name and he wanted the right to use it.  Next to him in court sat Neil Berriman, the son of Sandra Rivett, the nanny brutally killed in the Lucan family home in November 1974. The pair have struck up a friendship based on their shared history.  Although Neil Berriman did not object to today's legal ruling, he said he still feels strongly that his mother is the forgotten victim who is still awaiting justice.  Outside the court, George Bingham - now the 8th Earl - said: ""I've heard the most bizarre range of theories, some of them reasonably tasteless.  ""My own personal view, and it was one I took as an eight-year-old boy, is that he has unfortunately been dead since that time.  ""In the circumstances I would think it possible that he saw his life at an end, regardless of guilt or otherwise, being dragged through the courts and the media would have destroyed his personal life, his career and the chances of getting the custody of his children back. And that may well have pushed a man to end his own life, but I have no idea.""  Also speaking outside the court, Mr Berriman said the case remained shrouded in mystery.  ""I personally, along with other people I worked with on this case, know that the convenient drowning, shooting that night, of Lord Lucan is not true.  ""Maybe the police know more than they let on. But at the end we have to get to the truth and justice for Sandra. A horrible death, a young woman beaten - my mother.  ""There is no getting away from the fact that, whatever happened that night, Lord Lucan is guilty of something in my eyes."""
471,"A memorial service has been held for a Gosport sailor who went missing on a port visit to Dubai in 2012.  Leading Seaman Timmy MacColl, 28, originally from Killin in Stirlingshire, disappeared in May 2012 on the visit from HMS Westminster.  He was declared dead by the Royal Navy at the beginning of the month but his body has never been found.  Jim Cunningham, the grandfather of Mr MacColl's wife Rachael, insists the family will not ""give up hope"".  It is believed the sailor was last seen at the Rock Bottom Cafe in Dubai at 02:00 local time on 27 May 2012.  It is thought crew mates put the father of two in a taxi from a hotel bar after a night out  The service at St Mary the Virgin Church in Rowner Lane, Gosport was led by Canon John Draper.  It was attended by family, friends and naval personnel.  An interment at Hasler Naval Cemetery followed.  A spokeswoman for the Royal Navy said its ""sympathies are with Mrs MacColl"" and added it would continue to support her."
472,"Pop star Madonna says she suffered whiplash as a result of her ""nightmare"" accident at Wednesday's Brit Awards.  The 56-year-old was pulled backwards off stage by a cape, which was supposed to fall from her shoulders.  In an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show, taped on Thursday, the star said: ""I had a little bit of whiplash, I smacked the back of my head.  ""And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3am to make sure I was compos mentis.""  She added: ""I know how to fall, I have fallen off my horse many times.""  The singer blamed her fall on a wardrobe malfunction, saying her cape had been tied too tightly, meaning it could not be unfastened in time.  ""Everyone was worried my cape would slide off, so they tied it really tight around my neck,"" explained the singer.  ""I got to the top of the stairs and I pulled the silky string, and it wouldn't come undone.  ""I had two choices: I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall.""  The star recovered and finished her performance, which was the finale of the Brit Awards - where Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith were the big winners.  She refused to watch a replay of the incident on Jonathan Ross's show, which will be broadcast on ITV on Saturday 14 March.  ""It was a nightmare,"" she said, ""I actually created a horror show for everyone.""  The star added that she would not be recreating the performance on her forthcoming tour.  ""No more capes. Cape fear is over."""

474,"El Salvador has been ordered to investigate the single worst massacre committed during its civil war in a bid to bring those responsible to justice.  The Inter-American Human Rights Court ruled that an amnesty law did not cover the El Mozote massacre in 1981, when soldiers killed some 1,000 people.  A year ago, the current government asked for forgiveness for the state's violence.  El Salvador's 12-year civil war from 1980 to 1992 left some 75,000 dead.  The Inter-American Human Rights Court, based in Costa Rica, on Monday made its ruling on the massacre public.  The killings in and around El Mozote were part of a ""systematic plan of repression"" by the military during the civil war, the court said.  Between 11 and 13 December, 1981, soldiers from a now-banned battalion, the Atlacatl, shot dead residents of El Mozote suspected of sympathising with left-wing rebels.  Nearly half of the victims were children.  The court's statement said that 440 victims had been confirmed, but that evidence indicated the actual number was much higher.  The killings in El Mozote, some 200km (120 miles) from the capital, San Salvador, were the bloodiest single episode in the conflict.  Those responsible were not put on trial as the authorities agreed a general amnesty in 1992, as part of negotiations to end the civil war.  However, the obligation on the state of El Salvador to investigate, prosecute and punish those remained, the court said.  Among its findings, the court ordered El Salvador to:  The Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman in El Salvador welcomed the court's ruling but urged the state to make sure it was implemented.  In January, President Mauricio Funes wept as he asked for forgiveness from the families on behalf of the Salvadoran state."
475,"The coins, which date from late Roman times, have been categorised as ""treasure"".  They contain a small amount of silver, but experts have not yet put a value on the find.  The exact location of the discovery is being kept secret to protect the site from treasure hunters. The HM Coroner has been informed.  The coins are thought to have been lying just 12 inches beneath the surface of a field.  The Romans left Wales in 410AD, having first arrived in 47AD. Carmarthen was a Roman settlement from the first century AD.  Coins of the late Roman period feature the standard head and tails, with a Roman emperor on the head and a goddess - of fortune, hope or chastity - on the reverse.  The farmer, on whose land the find was made, said: ""There are lots of wild rumours flying about but I don't really want to say anything.  ""The coins are at the museum now, and we are waiting to hear what happens next,"" he added.  Edward Besley, of the National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff confirmed that the coins were at the museum and were being cleaned, examined and catalogued.  He said: ""When our investigations are complete, I will submit a report to the coroner who will then decide when to hold an inquest."""
476,"   A £74m retail complex built on a former town centre cattle market has opened its doors. Following eight years of rows, protests and delays Carmarthen's St Catherine's Walk welcomed its first shoppers. It includes a Debenham's department store, Apollo Cinema, and a range of other shops and restaurants opening in west Wales for the first time. Centre managers hope it will make the town the region's main shopping destination. They say it will lift Carmarthen seven places in the retail ranking of shopping centres, complied by marketing property specialists CACI, to the sixth best destination in Wales. The whole town will benefit from St Catherine's Walk    Plans to develop the former cattle market site were first announced by Carmarthenshire council in 2002 with developers Simons appointed a year later. But the project was hit by delays first due to opposition to the relocation of the nearby indoor market and then to plans to close St Catherine's Street. Organisers of Friday's official opening are putting any controversy behind them with a three day programme of events and family activities to mark the occasion. Centre manager Mike Pugh said: ""It will make Carmarthen a destination town for retail and entertainment. The whole town will benefit from St Catherine's Walk."" He said he expected it would attract visitors from the neighbouring counties of Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion and reverse the drift of shoppers east to centres like Llanelli and Swansea. The centre opens in two phases on the two May bank holiday weekends. Phase one on Friday includes Debenham's, the Apollo cinema, Next, Quiksilver, Cotswold Outdoor Clothing, Vision Express, Carphone Warehouse, Costa Coffee, Pizza Express and Frankie & Benny's. Phase two opens on 31 May. Stores include River Island, New Look, TopShop, Top Man and Miss Selfridge. Mr Pugh said they were delighted that some of the names were opening in west Wales for the first time - particularly given the economic climate of the recent years. ""Retailers don't open stores without a lot of research,"" he added. He said it was a demonstration of confidence that they had in the prospects for the centre. Trading seven days a week the 245,000 sq ft centre also includes and a 950 capacity purpose built car park. It has a total of 25 units with a number still available. It is being managed by Invista Real Estate Investment Management. Carmarthenshire council chief executive Mark James said: ""Carmarthen is on the verge of exciting times and we would like to involve everyone in celebrating its future. ""This exciting development will add to the town's shopping experience and will, undoubtedly, bring many more shoppers and visitors into the area, helping to boost local businesses and the economy.""     "
477,"The development will include a multi screen cinema, Debenhams department store and new market hall.  The plans for the old mart site in the centre of the town have been on the drawing board for more than five years.  But various disputes over the relocation of the indoor market, road closures and pedestrianisation of surrounding streets delayed progress.  The development, called St Catherine's Walk, was allowed to proceed after the scheme cleared its final hurdle in November.  A planning inquiry ruled potential problems caused by closing an access lane at the site would be ""negligible"".  Objectors forced the public inquiry by claiming Fair Lane was a vital link for people living to the north of the town.  But a Welsh Assembly Government appointed planning inspector gave the go-ahead to close Fair Lane.  Work on the scheme is expected to take around 18 months to complete.  It also includes restaurants and a multi-storey car park.  Developers Simons say it will create 500 jobs."
478,"Fethullah Gulen has been called Turkey's second most powerful man. He is also a recluse, who lives in self-imposed exile in the US.  An apparent power struggle between his followers and those around the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has reached a new pitch of intensity and loathing.  Since arriving in the US in the late 1990s, Mr Gulen, 74, has not given a single broadcast interview. What rare communication there has been with the media has almost exclusively been conducted via email.  But now, the BBC has had exclusive access to the Muslim cleric. I travelled with Guney Yildiz from the BBC Turkish Service to a remote part of Pennsylvania to meet the man.  In the interview, Mr Gulen denied using his influence to start investigations into alleged corruption among senior members of Mr Erdogan's AK Party which have led to a number of police commissioners being sacked and to some of Mr Erdogan's allies being arrested.  Two moments stood out from my interview with Mr Gulen. Neither had anything to do with what he said.  The first occurred as our camerawoman, Maxine, was making some last-minute adjustments to the lighting. Mr Gulen waved his hand wanly, and a man rushed forward from the chairs arranged on one side of the room. In his haste, he stumbled over the carpet. He was Mr Gulen's personal physician.  He took the blood pressure of his elderly charge, before poking, one-handed, a pill from its packet and giving it to his patient to chew. The testing and dispensing routine would be repeated later in the interview.  The second incident happened at the end of our long conversation, which was prolonged by the consecutive translation. Moments after Mr Gulen stood up, he swayed. One of his 13 followers in the room caught him by his shoulders, and righted him.  Fethullah Gulen may be, as the former US ambassador to Turkey James Jeffrey told me, Turkey's second most powerful man - an Islamic cleric who sits atop a movement with perhaps millions of followers, worth perhaps billions, with a presence, often through its high-achieving schools, in 150 countries.  But Mr Gulen's own physical capabilities appear to be ebbing. He has, we were told, a series of chronic ailments, and is recovering from an upper respiratory disorder. Indeed, just before the interview, one of his closest colleagues told me it had been on the cusp of being cancelled.  Mr Gulen had all along been deeply reluctant to agree to the interview request, but had been ""persuaded"" by his advisers.  And yet... even during the interview, the cleric proved surprisingly elusive. Surprising, because Mr Gulen has been almost universally depicted as being in a virtual death clinch with his erstwhile ally, Prime Minister Erdogan, in a struggle for power and vengeance in Turkey.  Whoever struck first, Mr Erdogan has recently been seeking to curb the reach of Mr Gulen's Hizmet (""Service"") movement, whose followers - or ""participants"" as some of them prefer to call themselves - include police chiefs and prosecutors leading corruption investigations into the heart of government. Mr Erdogan has decried their work as that of ""a state within a state"".  So why had Mr Gulen finally consented to allow the BBC to meet him on the extensive private estate in small-town Pennsylvania? (Mr Gulen came to the US after being charged with crimes against the state - charges he was later cleared of.)  The interview did not make his intentions altogether clear. But his advisers said the purpose was to clear up some misconceptions.  You can understand why when you read the adjectives that tend to hang around reports on Mr Gulen and Hizmet: ""secretive"" (Foreign Policy magazine); ""shadowy"" (The Economist); ""opaque"" (Los Angeles Times); ""insidious"" (Wikileaks cables).  And so, time was made before and after the interview to take us around the frozen grounds, which we were told were primarily a vacation retreat for families.  Mr Gulen, we were shown, lives not in the large complex that is often depicted in photographs, but a smaller adjacent building. We were taken to see his office and minuscule bedroom with single bed.  Twelve of us, not including Mr Gulen, squeezed into his private space to look at his collection of sand from Turkish beaches, his dark wooden bookshelves, his low-slung single bed with a furry brown cushion at one end, his prayer mat and outsized Koran.  When we did eventually meet, he appeared a man in discomfort. Occasionally the smallest of smiles would play at the corners of his mouth.  More often, as he waited for one of his long answers to be translated, he would close his eyes, and tilt his soft, wide face back in his armchair, with a look not of repose but of pain. And whether by political design or medical exhaustion, he seemed keen not to stoke too directly his feud with the prime minister.  He preferred passive to active verbs, airy plurals rather than specific singulars: ""I will remain personally silent, I will not return their acts.""  Of Hizmet's alleged direct involvement in the corruption investigations, he said that some of the demoted, sacked or reassigned members of the police and judiciary ""were not linked to us"".  ""These moves were made to make our movement appear bigger than it already is and to frighten people about this non-existent phantom threat.""  Why, in that case, have so many people - academics, newspapers, diplomats without a dog in the fight - suggested that it is inconceivable that he, Mr Gulen, did not give the direct order for the net to close in on Mr Erdogan's allies? Particularly after Mr Erdogan had moved to close down Hizmet schools in Turkey?  ""It is not possible for these judges and prosecutors to receive orders from me. I have no relation with them. I don't know even 0.1% of them.""  But also a tinge of sarcasm: ""People in the judiciary and the police carried out investigations and launched this case, as their duties normally require. Apparently they weren't informed of the fact that corruption and bribery have ceased to be criminal acts in Turkey.""  There was a time when there was a clear overlap in ambition between the apparently mild Islamic approach of this cleric, and the apparently mild Islamism of the AK Party under its coming man, then new prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  But were there not equally clear signs of divergence now, for example over Mr Erdogan's embrace of peace talks with the armed Kurdish separatists, led by their jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan?  Ocalan, said Mr Gulen, was ""uneasy with what we were doing with the Kurdish people"" (through the extension of Hizmet schools deep into Kurdish territory).  ""They didn't want our activities to prevent young people joining the militants in the mountains. Their politics is to keep enmity between Kurdish and Turkish people.""  The establishment of schools and investment in the region ""were regarded as if they were against the peace process"".  What of the heightening of tensions between Turkey and Israel in recent years? ""They try to portray us as a pro-Israeli movement, in the sense that we have a higher regard for them than our nation. We are accepting them as a people, as part of the people of the world.""  These quotations are culled and distilled from what others tell me is his peculiarly baroque language. One of his disciples explained that 15% of his speech is unlike anything normally heard in Turkish: Shakespearian rather than modern English, he said.  So given that, and given how I had seen - just in that room, and in the tortured process it had taken to set up the interview - the devotion shown by his followers, I asked a pointed question, seeking a direct answer. If you, Mr Gulen, were back in Turkey this year for the forthcoming local elections, and then presidential elections (in which Mr Erdogan is widely expected to run, in the hope of ruling with enhanced powers), who would you vote for?  Mr Gulen draws back, then hints; draws back again, hints again: ""I don't have the intention to say anything on that matter.  ""If I were to say anything to people I may say people should vote for those who are respectful to democracy, rule of law, who get on well with people. Telling or encouraging people to vote for a party would be an insult to peoples' intellect. Everybody very clearly sees what is going on.""  At one point, in the middle of his answer, he also comes up with the memorable circumlocution: ""I haven't even decided to say anything to that effect.""  And so that question which had hung as low as the clouds on that freezing day in the Poconos, Pennsylvania: Why, I asked several of his advisers-followers-participants, had Mr Gulen agreed to this interview? ""To set the record straight,"" they answered.  Straight, though, may not mean clear."
479,"The demolition of a huge Turkish statue devoted to reconciliation with Armenia has begun, months after the prime minister described it as a ""freak"".  The 30m-high statue - depicting two human figures facing each other - was erected on a mountain in the Turkish city of Kars, near the Armenian border.  Local authorities commissioned it several years ago to symbolise an end to decades of enmity and suspicion.  Artists had tried to save the statue, which could take 10 days to dismantle.  The company carrying out the demolition has already cut down one of the figures using a crane, witnesses said.  The work, called the Statue of Humanity, was the creation of well-known Turkish artist Mehmet Aksoy.  When finished, it would have had one figure extending a hand to the other.  ""I am really sorry, sorry on behalf of Turkey,"" Anatolia news agency quoted the sculptor as saying. ""They can demolish it, we will re-make it.""  It was commissioned as a gesture of reconciliation, as Turkey and Armenia began attempts to repair relations after a century of hostility.  But that process stalled last year and there were a number of objections to the monument.  On a visit to Kars in January Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly described the monument as a ""freak"", and an affront to a nearby 11th Century shrine.  Critics say Mr Erdogan may have aimed his remarks at nationalists, who are strong in this part of Turkey, ahead of June's parliamentary elections.  Kars once had a large Armenian community, which was annihilated in 1915 as part of mass killings which Armenians and many historians call a genocide.  Turkey rejects the term and says atrocities were committed on both sides in World War I.  In 2009 the two countries agreed to normalise relations and, in that spirit, the former mayor of Kars commissioned the sculpture."

Klitschko, who holds the IBF, IBO, WBO and WBA belts, was taken to hospital on Friday to have a kidney stone removed.  The 35-year-old initially hoped he would recover in time to face Mormeck in Dusseldorf on 10 December, however his management advised him to pull out.  Wladimir's manager Bernd Bonte said: ""He is sad but he feels extreme pain.""  Bonte added there were provisional plans to stage the fight on 3 March 2012, the nominal date for Klitschko to fight a mandatory challenger under IBF rules.  ""We hope to know in two or three days. Mormeck is also ready to accept it.""  After undergoing the operation on Saturday Klitschko spent the day in hospital with a high temperature and inflammation.  ""Wladimir shouldn't fight any time soon,"" German urologist Peter Albertz said during the press conference.  ""Anyone who sustains two surgeries in a span of less than 24 hours needs considerable time to rest.  ""He is very weak after two surgeries and it makes no sense to have a fight now.""  Klitschko defeated Britain's David Haye on points in July to win the WBA title.  Mormeck, 39, is a former WBC and WBA cruiserweight champion, who was defeated by Haye at that level in 2007.  However, he is undefeated since moving to heavyweight in 2009, winning three bouts against Vinny Maddalone, Fres Oquendo and Timur Ibragimov.  Wladimir's older brother Vitali holds the only other major heavyweight belt after defending his WBC title in September against Pole Tomasz Adamek."
481,"Devilishly dark humour and mischief romp about unchecked in the bizarre movie creation that is ""Gremlins"". The plot is thin and the pacing is askew, but this is a film that offers plenty of unpredictability, and a vicious streak enrobed in cornball humour.  Central to the mayhem is the deliriously cute Mogwai named ""Gizmo"". Bought from a curiosity shop and presented to Zach Galligan as a Christmas gift, it's every toy firm's dream of interactivity and playability. Except this is a real animal, and is issued with instructions to not get it wet and especially not to feed it after midnight.  Inevitably, it isn't long before both rules have been broken, with Gizmo spawning cute offspring that turn into hideous Gremlins. These foul creatures run amok, torturing and even killing the local residents. This is all staged with a macabre humour that is director Joe Dante at his best.  ""Gremlins"" has not garnered many good reviews, with most dismissing it as animatronic nonsense wrapped in crude tastelessness. But while the film has some slightly 'sick' moments, it really resembles a fairytale. And in this tradition, it presents the briefest plot and injects some cruel twists that are really quite funny.  The backdrop of a picturesque snow-covered town at Christmas offers maximum potential for villainous amusement, and the Gremlins don't miss a trick. They're obviously film buffs, and take great delight in poking fun at some of the classic fare we can expect to see on Christmas TV. Just hope that you don't find any Gizmos under the tree.  Read a review of ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch""."
482,"Some 33 members of ousted Tunisian leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali's family have been arrested, state TV has said.  They were held over the past few days as they tried to leave the country.  In a televised speech, interim leader Fouad Mebazaa vowed a ""total break"" with the past, an independent justice system and media freedoms.  In a separate development, the new government said it had freed all political prisoners. The reported move comes after weeks of mass protests.  State television showed what it said was gold and jewellery found during raids on the family members' properties. It is not known which family members have been arrested.  Swiss officials estimate Tunisian government officials have put about $620m into Swiss banks, the Associated Press news agency reports.  In Paris, the anti-corruption group Transparency International France and two other associations have filed a legal case alleging corruption by Mr Ben Ali and his wife.  More than 100 people have reportedly died in the unrest, the UN said, promising to carry out an investigation.  Hundreds of protesters took to the streets again in the Tunisian capital Tunis, urging allies of the ousted president to stop clinging to power.  Waving banners and chanting, they called for all links to the old regime to be severed.  However, riot police did not respond with tear gas or water cannon, the BBC's Wyre Davies in Tunis reports.  While the situation remains tense, curfew hours have been reduced, traffic on the streets is increasing, political cartoons have appeared in the newly free press and some shops and businesses are reopening, our correspondent says.  ""I guarantee that this transition government will ensure a total break with the past,"" Mr Mebazaa said on Wednesday.  ""Together we can write a new page in the history of our country.""  In his address to the nation Mr Mebazaa also thanked the army for helping to maintain security, saying that the situation was returning to normal.  ""We have discovered those responsible for the terror in our country. We have arrested these armed gangs.""  As the political turmoil continues, Tunisia's national unity cabinet is reported to have postponed its first meeting.  Ministers in the new interim government are currently discussing how to resolve deep divisions over the inclusion in key posts of members of the former government.  One of them, opposition leader Najib Chebbi, told the BBC's Hardtalk programme he would resign if a free election failed to materialise within seven months.  ""All the people who came to this unity government will resign if the elections are not free and fair or the measures we have decided on are not carried out immediately.""  Mr Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia on Friday following a spate of violent protests across Tunisia over unemployment, poverty and corruption.  Four opponents of Mr Ben Ali resigned from the new unity government within a day of being appointed, in protest at the number of ministers from the old regime who were still included.  In Geneva, Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey announced a decision to freeze any funds of Mr Ben Ali's held there.  Ms Calmy-Rey said Bern acted to prevent assets being withdrawn and also to ensure that a new Tunisian administration would be able to retrieve assets taken illicitly.  The ban also applies to any assets held by ""his entourage"", the foreign ministry said in a statement.  A Swiss judicial source told Reuters news agency that an association of Tunisians living in Switzerland had sought the freezing of assets including a building on Geneva's exclusive Rue du Rhone and a Falcon 9000 jet said to be at Geneva airport.  In other developments on Wednesday, the head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, linked the upheaval in Tunisia to deteriorating economic conditions throughout the Arab world.  ""The Arab soul is broken by poverty, unemployment and general recession,"" he said at the opening of an Arab League summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh."
483,"On the face of it, BBC Parliament is the narrowest of niche channels. You’d have to travel down the channel listings as far as Discovery Ironing +1 before you’d find something more niche. What it says in the lid is very much what is inside: Parliament. This means committee hearings and debates from the devolved parliament and assemblies, as well as full coverage of the Westminster chambers. They occupy the bulk of the schedule.  But there is something in the character of these debates and hearings which is the source of an idea we’ve been exploring. We care about authenticity and speech, unmediated. It’s the opposite of soundbite television. There is a lot going on in the political world which is worth hearing in full and a lot of resources to be tapped into – by way of archive and material from other broadcasters – not available anywhere else.  So, over a bank holiday weekend where the weather was less than inspiring, the channel made use of some surprising resources.  From abroad, we broadcast the whole of the election debate between Sarkozy and Royal (Friday evening with translation – all two hours 40 minutes of it). From the election night itself, the channel took coverage from TF1 and France 2, in French, for those who wanted to experience the event direct and as an alternative to the high-powered special presented by Jon Sopel on BBC News 24, (who, rather conventionally, stuck to broadcasting in English). Earlier in the day, we heard from C-SPAN, with Angela Merkel on the transatlantic partnership.  From the archive, ten years on from New Labour coming to power, BBC Parliament showed in entirety the election night broadcast and this ran all day across the rainy bank holiday Monday. We’ve been told that many participants in the 1997 election stayed glued to their sets, throughout the day. (Next stop in our tour of the election archive:1987, which is showing 5 October).  Drawing on the BBC’s wider resources, the channel showed BBC Scotland’s beautiful film by Ruaridh Nicoll. Patriot Games, examining the history of the Act of Union. And from our own archives, in a new documentary, Robert Orchard told the complex story of Tony Blair’s relationship with Parliament as he prepares to step down.  This morning, that extraordinary opening session of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Back to the Commons, this afternoon, and normal business.  The programming ‘specials’ do, I think, offer something of value and they get the channel noticed in newspaper articles and blogs. In turn, this helps us reach a wider audience for our normal parliamentary schedule. BBC Parliament is the only parliamentary channel, among dozens in the world, to have regular audience ratings (we reach around one million adults, per month) and I think these specials play their part.

A number of young bands will be playing along with an AC/DC tribute and rock covers band.  Scott was born in the town in 1946 but moved to Australia when he was six and later became the singer with AC/DC.  He died of alcohol poisoning in 1980, aged 33, after a night of heavy drinking in London.  Two years ago, a plaque was unveiled in Kirriemuir dedicated to the frontman.  Victoria Melton, one of the organisers of the event, said: ""Bon Scott is one of Kirriemuir's sons, and what better a man to pay tribute to.  ""He's been a huge influence to a lot of people all over the world.  ""We feel that he always remembered his roots and he had a strong character.""  Her colleague Steven Gibbons added: ""He's the singer that the band had that everyone talked about. He's obviously quite an important icon in rock music.  ""Everyone who plays any rock influenced music, they can't really ignore the influence that AC/DC have had, especially the Bon Scott era music, which was really powerful, and it's still as powerful today as it was back then.""

Unlike other multiplayer online games like the hugely popular World of Warcraft, which is split into smaller groups, the thousands of EVE players are in it together. In one virtual galaxy, players build, fight, and trade, joining together to form ""corporations"" to gain control over sections of the huge starscape. This creates a complex society where anything can happen, and often does. Rules are few, and all of the lying, cheating and stealing that occurs in real life can also happen in the game. A player called ""The Mittani"" is the shadowy spymaster who runs dozens of agents for his corporation - GoonSwarm. He got the call of his career when a disgruntled BoB director contacted him to say that he was thinking of switching sides. With the director's access to BoB's internal workings, the pair were able to disband the corporation and steal all the assets they could lay their hands on. To add insult to injury, GoonSwarm then re-registered the Band of Brothers name for itself, leaving the former alliance nameless and broken. It's a finale that has been compared to ""Apple dissolving Microsoft"", and led to some players calling for the game's developer, CCP, to ""roll-back"" the game to the previous day and cancel the change. Eve Online is about the struggle between giant corporations ""Any one director should not have the power to destroy the work of so many people for so many months and years with two mouse clicks,"" wrote a player called David on an EVE-related blog. But CCP is well-known for keeping its hands off action within the game. Since no rules were broken, the changes stood, and thousands of BoB members woke up to a very different world. This is not the first time that rogue bankers and credit fraud have made EVE Online seem more like the financial pages than a space cowboy video game. In January, a player absconded with over 80bn ISK, the game's virtual currency, from an in-game bank. Although the 80bn is only worth a few thousand pounds if exchanged for real money, it represents hours of in-game toil. In an online echo of the real-world banking crisis, the bank's chairman issued a statement to calm a run on deposits, writing: ""Dynasty Banking will get over these times and we will continue to strive to earn the public's faith as one of the leading banks of Eve Online"". Another scam on an epic scale beyond the fantasies of real conmen was perpetrated in 2006, when a player ran off with 700bn ISK from another EVE bank. ""Think of me as a space Robin Hoodsteals from the rich and gives to himself,"" wrote the perpetrator in an EVE-related internet forum. Such swindles left some players in awe of EVE's potential for realism, whilst others called for a stronger code of ethics in the game. But spymaster Mittani scoffed at calls for in-game morals, noting that without dirty tricks, GoonSwarm would have had no chance of toppling a more established corporation like BoB. He said: ""We don't have any advantages, so we can't obey your stupid 'space bushido'. We're going to spy, we're going to use defectors, we're going to lie, cheat, steal and be bastards.""     "
486,"India's former football captain Baichung Bhutia has announced his retirement from the international game.  The 34-year-old star striker has been struggling with injuries.  Bhutia was the first player from the sub-continent to sign a professional contract with a European football club when he signed for Bury in 1999.  He is also the only Indian footballer to play more than 100 matches for his country during his distinguished 16-year career.  ""I had a fantastic 16 years of international football. I enjoyed every moment to have represented the country, to have contributed to the game,"" Bhutia told reporters on Wednesday.  ""I wanted to continue playing but the last seven-eight months have been frustrating due to a lot of injuries. So I have decided to quit,"" he added.  The footballer said he would continue to play for his club, United Sikkim FC, which he founded.  ""Lot of things in life do not happen the way we wish so I am quitting from international football but will continue playing for my club,"" he said.  Bhutia scored 43 goals in international football, the highest by an Indian footballer. He played for Bury FC in England for three years until 2002.  India won a premier South Asian championship three times under his captaincy.  Bhutia, a Buddhist, comes from the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim.  India is ranked 158 among the 203 football playing countries, according to soccer's governing body, Fifa."
487,"The group beat Travis and Idlewild into second and third place respectively.  Franz Ferdinand, who recently picked up five Brit Award nominations, ended up in 15th place, while the Eurythmics wound up at a lowly 38.  Other Scottish acts, such as the Mull Historical Society who also featured in the top 50, performed at a party in Glasgow where the result was announced.  Scottish-based band Snow Patrol, who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of Brit Awards, were among the performers who covered well-known Scottish pop songs at the party on Wednesday night.  They were the surprise winners of the Brit Award for best breakthrough act two years later.  Scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list, including 1970s tartan boy band the Bay City Rollers and goth favourites the Jesus and Mary Chain.  Scottish magazine The List recently compiled a list of the top 50 Scottish bands of all time, but left the final decision to the public.  The magazine's music editor Mark Robertson said: ""The idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of Scottish music, from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop, right up to today's international stars.""  ""Everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide,"" he added.  BBC Radio Scotland presenter Vic Galloway, who has been involved in the project, said it had been ""great fun"" to look back at Scotland's musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming Scottish acts."
488,"The 36-year-old was taken by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary's neurological unit on Wednesday.  A hospital spokesman said: ""He has seen some improvement overnight, but remains in a serious but stable condition.""  Mr Hammond had been in a dragster-style car capable of reaching speeds of about 300mph at Elvington airfield near York.  The hospital said his wife was at his bedside and, at the request of his family, no more information would be released.  The crash will be investigated by the Health and Safety Executive and the BBC.  The BBC said in a statement: ""We are looking into all the factors of this accident and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage until we know the full situation.""  The dragster car he was driving was believed to have been travelling at about 300mph when it crashed.  Motoring expert Adam Rayner, of Fast Car magazine, said that at those speeds the driver would experience forces similar to those endured by fighter pilots.  ""These cars accelerate at 6G - the force is breathtaking and stopping is a real difficulty,"" he said.  Former firefighter Dave Ogden, who runs private firm Event Fire Services, was one of the first people at the scene of the crash.  He said: ""We were down there with Top Gear who were filming him trying to break the British land speed record.  ""On the previous run, the car had just gone over 300mph but I am not sure if it had broken the record.  ""They had just done one more run and were planning to finish when it veered off to the right.  ""One of the parachutes had deployed but it went on to the grass and spun over and over before coming to a rest about 100 yards from us.""  He said his crew and an ambulance that was already on the airfield rushed over and found the car upside down and ""dug in"" to the grass.  Mr Ogden said he felt for a pulse and heard Mr Hammond breathing before the emergency crews worked together to turn the car the right way up and then cut him free.  He added: ""He was regaining consciousness at that point and said he had some lower back pain. But he was drifting in and out of consciousness a little bit.""  Former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson said the presenter was ""irreplaceable"".  He said: ""He is a wonderful, unique and distinctive Top Gear presenter.  ""He has brought an awful lot to the programme and his indefatigable energy, the fact that he tries absolutely anything once, may have been the reason that he has overstepped the mark a bit.  ""He has turned Top Gear into a gang show with Jeremy and James and the three of them have wowed audiences all over the world and he is an international personality.""  Mr Willson added: ""There is no pressure from the BBC or the producer to take undue risks.  ""But that pressure is in your own head. You want to do an item on the programme which is mindblowing.""  The presenter, who works on Top Gear with fellow hosts Jeremy Clarkson and James May, grew up in Solihull, was educated in Yorkshire and lives near Cheltenham with his wife and children.  In addition to presenting Top Gear for the BBC, he is also presenting the current series of Brainiac on Sky One."
489,"The 34-year-old fought off competition from the likes of likes of TV chef Jamie Oliver and comedy star Catherine Tate in a poll of industry experts.  Tennant shot to fame in the BBC drama Casanova earlier this year.  TV veteran Bill Oddie took fourth place on Broadcast magazine's Hot 100 list on the back of the surprise success of his BBC Two nature series, Springwatch.  Broadcast said landing the role of one of TV's most iconic characters has propelled Tennant into the big time.  ""As yet we've had only the briefest glimpse of him as the Doctor, but if you missed his exuberant, charismatic, detailed performance as the eponymous hero in Casanova - where were you?""  Oliver came second in the list after his Channel 4 series sparked a campaign to improve school dinners.  I'm a Celebrity hosts Ant and Dec were placed fifth, with Broadcast saying they ""stand head and shoulders above their presenting peers"".  ITV1's daytime host Paul O'Grady, Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond and Hardeep Singh Kohli, who created the Channel 4 show Meet the Magoons, also won praise."

He said: ""The day's been a huge success, judging by the queue outside, it's enormous!  ""As an event, it's really showing off the Herefordshire county, where the country isn't just something to be looked at, it's a place that people work in and live in, and base their existence on it.""

491,"Former Top Gear host Richard Hammond has been flown to hospital after a crash while filming in Switzerland.  The 47-year-old was on a practice run for a race in an electric car for Amazon Prime show The Grand Tour.  Mr Hammond ""climbed out of the car himself before the vehicle burst into flames"", the show said in a statement.  Co-host Jeremy Clarkson tweeted that it was the ""most frightening"" accident he had ever seen but said Mr Hammond, who fractured a knee, was ""mostly OK"".  The show's statement said Mr Hammond had been involved in a ""serious crash"" after completing the Hemberg Hill Climb in Switzerland, where a race takes place on Sunday.  He had been driving a ""Rimac Concept One, an electric super car built in Croatia, during filming for The Grand Tour Season 2 on Amazon Prime, but very fortunately suffered no serious injury"".  Mr Hammond was ""conscious and talking"" after the crash, the show said, and had been flown to hospital in St Gallen ""to be checked over"".  ""Nobody else was in the car or involved in the accident, and we'd like to thank the paramedics on site for their swift response.  ""The cause of the crash is unknown and is being investigated,"" the statement added.  The Hemburg organisers said the official race would take place as planned on Sunday.  A statement said: ""The vehicle left the track and landed in the meadow.""  They added that rescuers had been ""very fast"" to reach the scene.  The crash comes 11 years after Mr Hammond nearly died when he lost control of a Vampire dragster while filming for Top Gear.  He was in a coma for two weeks after the accident at Elvington Airfield, near York.  Mr Hammond, who had been driving at speeds of up to 288mph (463km/h), suffered brain injuries but made a full recovery.  A ""catastrophic disintegration"" of the jet car's front tyre, probably caused by an object like a nail, caused the crash, a BBC report later concluded.  In early March 2017, Mr Hammond said he had fallen off a motorbike ""many times"" while filming an episode of The Grand Tour in Mozambique and ""banged my head"".  But he also said he was ""fine"", although Mr Clarkson told the Sun newspaper that Mr Hammond had ""hurt himself quite badly""."
492,"The German magazine, Stern, has published the first instalment of the controversial ""Hitler Diaries"" - an account of World War II allegedly written by the Führer himself.  But the magazine's news conference in Hamburg erupted in extraordinary scenes as Lord Dacre, the eminent British historian who authenticated the diaries only days ago, said he was having second thoughts.  There has been fierce debate over the diaries since their discovery was first reported last week.  At today's news conference, the Stern journalist who is said to have found the diaries in East Germany, Gerd Heidemann, told the story of his scoop.  He said he traced the diaries to a hayloft in East Germany, where they had lain since an East German general rescued them from a crashed plane in 1945.  Then Stern brought in the diaries themselves to show journalists - the first time they have been exposed to general public scrutiny.  The magazine is said to have paid nearly nine million marks ($5 million) for them. A further deal has been done with the Sunday Times newspaper, which paid $400,000 for the English serialisation rights.  Lord Dacre, a world-class expert on Hitler, is the only historian to have closely examined the diaries.  He wrote an article in the Times two days ago saying he was convinced they were genuine.  But today, to the horror of the Stern executives sitting by his side, he told the news conference he had been unable to establish a proper link between the crashed plane and the alleged diaries.  He said there could be no final judgement until the papers had been properly investigated.  ""I must say I regret that the normal methods of historical verification have been sacrificed to the requirements of the journalistic scoop,"" he continued.  Lord Dacre is a director of Times Newspapers Ltd, and has been closely involved with plans to publish the diaries in the Sunday Times newspaper in three weeks' time.  A spokesman for the Times Newspaper group said further investigations would now be carried out to investigate whether the diaries were genuine.  The alleged diaries cover a period from 1932 until shortly before Hitler's death in Berlin in 1945.  They are said to disclose, among other things, that Hitler allowed the British Army to escape from Dunkirk in the hope of concluding a peace settlement."
493,"The Conservatives made significant gains over Labour in Lancashire.  They took the seats of Morecambe and Lunesdale, Blackpool North and Cleveleys, South Ribble, Pendle and Rossendale and Darwen.  The Liberal Democrats gained Burnley, formerly the seat of Labour's Kitty Ussher, who resigned in the expenses' fallout.  The Morecambe and Lunesdale result saw Tory David Morris replace Geraldine Smith, who had held the seat for the past 13 years.  The Tories also retained the seats of Wyre and Preston North, Ribble Valley and Fylde.  Rossendale and Darwen saw an 8.9% swing to the Conservatives, with Jake Berry overturning a Labour majority of 3,616 to win by 4,493 votes.

497,"Initially called MP3, the band formed in 2001 with three members:    Pete Wishart - keyboards;    Ian Cawsey - bass guitar and vox;    Greg Knight - drums.    They were later joined by Kevin Brennan on lead guitar and subsequently changed their name to reflect their late addition. Pete Wishart is best known as the keyboard player from the Gaelic rock band, Runrig. He was also in the original line-up of Big Country and played with the group for a year. He is the only MP to have appeared on Top of the Pops. Ian Cawsey has played in many local bands including Zebra, Chinese Whispers, Brix, Mandrake, Sneeky Feet and The Moggies. Other musical activities running in the Parliament include: The Parliament Choir and Lord Colwyn's Jazz Band. When the news broke at around 3 am on Friday 6th May that Greg Knight kept his Yorkshire East seat it was clear that Parliaments one and only rock band MP4, made up solely of Parliament members, would not find itself needing a new drummer or keyboard player. The Scottish Nationalist MP Pete Wishart cruised home in Tayside North and guitarist Kevin Brennan defended his Labour stronghold in Cardiff West meaning the band remains intact. ""Given that we are of different political persuasions, I know that all of us on election night all looked very quickly for our fellow musicians' results to ensure that on Friday we would still be together and it was quite close."" Said bass player Ian Cawsey. ""In Pete Wishart's Scottish constituency there's a new boundary which made it much more difficult to gain seats for him.

The bands' venture to release a charity record later in the year can now continue as planned. ""We've recorded four tracks so far and we may do some more."" Said Ian, ""we haven't come up with a date of when we'll release it but we're hoping it will be around the summer or autumn time.""

498,"The NHS faces unrelenting pressure despite funding rising. Why?  The sheer scale of the NHS can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world.  Last year £140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago.  And that's after you adjust it for inflation.  Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every £1 spent on services goes on health.  Even during the years of deep austerity, extra money has been found for the health service - £8bn more this Parliament in England alone.  Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams.  The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack.  Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital.  Which local services are under threat?  When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours.  But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year.  The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering around the 90% mark in recent weeks.  The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now.  This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more.  But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two.  The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much.  As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at £20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this.  Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly.  All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy.  This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending.  Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse.  But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give.  Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was closer to 7%.  As you can see the period since 2010 has seen the tightest financial settlements. What is more, the spending squeeze is continuing during this Parliament at almost exactly the same rate, even with England's extra £8bn going in.  Ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got.  Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population.  But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy.  The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders.  But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC this week is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up.  Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do.  But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts.  Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all.  There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare.  The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s.  But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community.  The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult.  The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by a third in 12 years.  Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition.  There are attempts to change this. To place more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less.  But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital.  In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state.  However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves.  The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at £60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes.  But none of them has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done?  Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils? Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other?  Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention?  But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do."
499,"A long-term critic of Tony Blair over the invasion of Iraq, Mr Simpson has also opposed the prime minister's support for new nuclear power plants.  In a letter to his constituency party members, the MP said a Gordon Brown-led premiership would be even worse.  Mr Simpson, 58 and first elected for Nottingham South in 1992, said there were ""not enough"" good Labour MPs.  He said he would be more effective campaigning for radical environmental change outside parliament, rather than remaining on the back benches.  Mr Simpson said in a letter to party members: ""There are good people in the Parliamentary Labour Party but not enough of them. At times, I feel that colleagues would vote for the slaughter of the first born if asked to.""  He added that another factor behind his decision is the birth last year of a baby daughter from his third marriage."
500,"The faculty of education, also known as Rolle College, will now be transferred to Plymouth. The 4,000 students and 300 staff will move to the city in 2008.  About 300 students walked out of the meeting as the announcement was made on Friday afternoon.  The university says consolidating activity at its Plymouth base strengthens its work.  It is claimed moving the campus, known as Rolle College, will cost the local economy £20m.  Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roland Lewinsky, said: ""In my view, this is a necessary development to help us achieve the mission of becoming an international centre of learning and research excellence serving the whole of the South West peninsula.  ""We now have several years of hard work ahead to manage the relocation with the minimum disruption for our staff and students.""  One mature student told the BBC the decision was a real blow.  ""There will be no hope of me going to Plymouth, so they've taken away the chance for mature students to get a further education."""
501,"I understand that there is no suggestion of gross misconduct, or dishonesty, or of what was described to me as ""impropriety"".  Clearly there are serious concerns of some sort, or Professor Purcell wouldn't have been suspended.  But this does help to clarify things, because until now there was no hint at all as to why she had been ""placed on leave"".  What should we make of this?  Some business leaders are concerned that if the university looks shaky at the top, the impressive investment that's been going on there could start to dry up.  On the other hand, the South West Devon MP Gary Streeter told us that he trusts the governors completely, and if there's a process to be gone through, he's happy for them to go through it."
502,"The comments made on The Apprentice have prompted the Association of Colleges to write to Sir Alan.  Chief executive Dr John Brennan says his surprise was compounded by the fact that Sir Alan's firm Viglen is a major IT supplier to the education sector.  Dr Brennan said ""an apology would not be out of place"".  Sir Alan's remarks were made in the boardroom to team leader Alexa Tilley, a Cambridge University graduate, after her group's disastrous attempts to run a pizza stall.  In his letter, Dr Brennan said the comments had ""caused outrage"" among AoC members.  He said: ""I can only assume those comments were made in ignorance of the reality of modern further education - and in particular of the real experiences of the four million students studying there.""  A spokesman for Sir Alan was not immediately able to comment on the issue.  Sir Alan's technology firm Viglen is a major technology supplier to colleges and schools.  Its website declares: ""Across two decades of growth, Viglen has become a supplier of choice to many of the UK's progressive, forward-thinking FE colleges.. our dedicated education team understands the dynamic environment of Further Education inside out.""  Dr Brennan said it seemed ""quite extraordinary"" that Sir Alan would want to risk the reputation of his business.  In his letter he says: ""It seems quite extraordinary that you would want to risk the commercial reputation of your own business. The example of Gerald Ratner springs to mind.""  One college head has written to Sir Alan to make his feelings known.  Dr David Collins, principal of South Cheshire College in Crewe, challenged The Apprentice contestants to go head-to-head with a team of his own students in a business challenge.  He described Sir Alan's comments as ""derogatory"" towards further education colleges.  He said: ""As the principal and chief executive of one such college I would like to challenge this remark and pit half a dozen of my students against six of his contestants.  ""The general view around South Cheshire College is that our students would give contestants a run for their money.""  He added: ""It's obvious that Mr Sugar has a lot to learn about further education and I am writing to him directly to express that view."""
503,"Sir Alan Sugar's relationship with Tottenham's fans often seemed to be one of mutual antipathy.  The millionaire arrived at White Hart Lane in 1991 and made it clear that he saw Spurs as a business proposition, not a labour of love.  He took pride in declaring that he wasn't a Spurs fan and didn't even particularly like football.  And in 1998 he did something that turned many fans against him for good - installing George Graham as manager.  Graham had been a star player for arch-rivals Arsenal as well as one of their most successful ever managers.  During Sugar's time in charge Tottenham, they never finished higher than seventh in the league and their only trophy was the Worthington Cup.  Somewhat predictably, it was the hostility of the White Hart Lane faithful that forced the Amstrad boss away from the club.  Bernie Kingsley, editor of Spurs fanzine Cock-a-doodle-do, said he was not particularly sorry to see Sugar go.  ""I'm not a rabid anti-Sugar man, but it's hard to deny that things haven't gone how they should since he's been in charge,"" he said.  ""At best we've stood still under his stewardship, while the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal have surged ahead.  ""His choice of managers has not been great. Ossie Ardiles was naive and didn't get results, Gerry Francis was good to start with but was kept on too long, Christian Gross was a mistake and George Graham is yet to prove himself.""  But Kingsley did acknowledge the good work that Sugar had done off the pitch at Spurs.  ""The club was massively in debt when he arrived and now we are one of the richest clubs in Europe,"" he said. ""I think the fans respect rather than like Sugar for that.""  International sports entertainment business, the English National Investment Company (ENIC), has agreed to buy Sugar's shares in Spurs to gain a 29.9% holding in the club.  Kingsley said Spurs' fans would be adopting a 'wait and see' attitude to ENIC.  ""It's a bit early to say what we think about the takeover. ENIC have said they won't be throwing money into the club to start with, which is a concern.  ""But the the company is making some positive noises, saying how it wants Spurs to become its flagship football club.  ""ENIC also wants to expand Spurs' interests. For example, the club is rare in not having signed a deal with a media company yet.  ""And Levy comes into the club as a fan - something Sugar never was - so he should be able to identify better with the club and its traditions."""
504,"George Graham has always courted success but never popularity - which was just as well in the eyes of Spurs fans.  Graham's hasty departure from White Hart Lane was the inevitable conclusion to a war of attrition he was never going to win.  Spurs fans almost challenged him to win their hearts and minds by ditching his football principles that were set in stone to do things the so-called ""Tottenham way"".  They issued the challenge - then turned against him when it became clear Graham was only interested in his way not their way.  Graham's theory was based on the not unreasonable suggestion that Tottenham's traditional approach had brought a meagre return of one title in 40 years.  He won the occasional battle, lifting The Worthington Cup in 1999 shortly after his arrival from Leeds United and leading Spurs to FA Cup semi-final this season, but he was never going to win the war.  The tough Scot's football philosophy and background counted against him in the eyes of Spurs fans, who saw him tainted as a successful manager of bitter north London rivals Arsenal. They also saw him as the living embodiment of what they regarded as then chairman Sir Alan Sugar's failure to bond with the Spurs following. What chairman would genuinely believe he was giving Spurs fans a gift they wanted by appointing a hugely successful former Highbury legend who still had Arsenal shares as manager? Graham was given a welcome that could be described, at best, as cautious when he took over. The majority of supporters greeted him with reserve and suspicion, feelings that would run the entire length of his White Hart Lane reign. He never heard his name chanted by Spurs fans, some of whom would only call him ""the man in the raincoat"" rather than actually utter his name.  Graham was not prepared to alter his principles an inch to accommodate the feelings of the fans - and in the end it was his undoing. Indeed, after the influential Tottenham Action Group lobbied for a vote of no confidence in chairman Sugar and the Spurs board, Graham was swift to label them ""professional whingers."" It was hardly the act of a man intent on currying favour with the fans. He will believe he can leave Spurs with his head held high after plotting a dramatic FA Cup quarter-final win at West Ham last week. Graham is convinced he has a promising group of youngsters - but he was never going to change the Spurs' fans feelings towards him. He stoked up their rage before the start of the season by selling the beloved David Ginola to Aston Villa for £3m. Spurs fans were up in arms, and yet Graham's judgement has been proved correct as the flamboyant Ginola has been a major disappointment at Villa Park.  He offered up £11m Ukranian Sergei Rebrov as the player he believed would be as exciting and influential as Ginola, but with the added bonus of being a team player. So it was with heavy irony that Rebrov finally produced the form he is capable of by scoring twice in the game that was to prove to be Graham's Spurs swansong at West Ham. But he has also had to contend with the ""will he won't he"" Sol Campbell contract saga that took on the appearance of a daily soap opera to cast a shadow over Graham's work. The end, when it came, was unexpected and badly timed. George Graham has finally gone - defeated in a one-sided battle against Spurs fans and Spurs tradition. And it is highly unlikely there will be many tears shed inside White Hart Lane at his departure."
505,"Stella English, who won The Apprentice in 2010, became so disillusioned with the £100,000 job she ended up taking Lord Sugar to an employment tribunal.  Ms English, from Whitstable, Kent is one of eight winners since the show launched in 2005.  What happened to the others?  Transport manager Tim Campbell, from East London beat Saira Khan to become Lord Sugar's first Apprentice.  Two years later he left, making what he describes as a ""brave decision"" to leave the Amstrad ""comfort zone"", and founded a social enterprise Bright Ideas Trust to help young entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds.  He became a social enterprise ambassador for the government and London's ambassador for training and enterprise and was made an MBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for his services to enterprise culture.  Ms Khan is now a corporate speaker and TV presenter and reporter on ITV's the Martin Lewis Money Show.  Lord Sugar told the tribunal series two winner Michelle Dewberry was the only contestant other than Ms English to leave the £100,000 job before the end of her 12-month contract.  She has since become a motivational speaker, Sky News breakfast TV pundit and magazine columnist. She runs a business consultancy and founded bargain deals website DailyChic.  ""Winning the show is something Michelle is very proud of,"" said her spokeswoman. ""The profile she gained is something she uses to raise awareness of the causes that are close to her heart, such as Women's Aid.""  On Friday she Tweeted she was lunching with Dragon's Den entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne, a fellow Women's Aid supporter.  Her rival in The Apprentice final, no-nonsense Ruth Badger, runs her own business consultancy in Manchester.  Cambridge graduate Simon Ambrose worked for Lord Sugar's property company Amsprop for three years, during which he studied as a chartered surveyor.  Since then he has invested in a London restaurant, members club and art gallery and owns and runs an event production company and become a property developer.  ""I enjoyed my three years with Lord Sugar and saw him regularly, my desk being only yards from his office,"" he said.  Among Mr Ambrose's fellow contestants was Katie Hopkins, the mother-of-two who walked off the show after Sir Alan questioned her about childcare. She turned up on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here nine months later.  Lee McQueen was the winner who rang in sick on his first day in the new £100,000 job.  Lord Sugar, then still Sir Alan, told BBC Radio 4 he caught a virus when he was in Spain. ""He's phoning me every 10 minutes giving me chapter and verse on how many times he has visited the loo,"" he said.  Mr McQueen went on to set up a digital media business with Lord Sugar's son Simon.  ""The Apprentice tests you in every way, stamina, business acumen, team work, confidence it was a great experience,"" he says on his website.  He later founded the recruitment company Raw Talent Academy, helping young people - not necessarily just graduates - start careers in sales and recruitment.  Restaurant owner Yasmina Siadatan worked her one-year £100,000 contract at Lord Sugar's Amscreen Healthcare company, which supplies advertising and information screens to hospitals and GPs.  After taking time off to have two children she was headhunted earlier this year by former Dragon's Den star James Caan.  She now works for his private equity firm Hamilton Bradshaw.  The runner-up in 2009, Kate Walsh, became a TV presenter, fronting early evening shows Channel 5 Live and OK! TV.  Awaiting judgement on her constructive dismissal claim from Lord Sugar's IT firm Viglen after she claimed she had no real role at the company.  She told an employment tribunal her boss Bordan Tkachuk informed her, ""there is no job"", on her first day.  But Lord Sugar said she was a ""headline grabber"" who was ""desperate for money"".  One of her rivals, Stuart ""The Brand"" Baggs, who made the final three, became known for outrageous statements including: ""I'm not a one-trick pony, I'm not a 10-trick pony - I've got a field of ponies waiting to literally run towards this job.""  Inventor Tom Pellereau was the first contestant to win the chance to set up his own company with a £250,000 investment and help and advice from Lord Sugar.  His scheme to redesign office chairs failed to impress his business partner in the final of the show, but one invention, a curved nail file has gone into production and is now stocked by Sainsbury's, Tesco and Amazon.  He says he ""cannot help"" but come up with new inventions almost every day - which he says could been seen by some as ""an affliction"".  He has worked on other products including a range of baby feeding accessories.  Biochemist, recruitment manager and wrestler Ricky Martin won Lord Sugar's £250,000 investment after pitching the idea for a specialist recruitment company for science and technology jobs.  But Mr Holzherr has since been backed by private and institutional investors and set the business up with another partner."
506,"Three tourists have been injured by a shark in three separate attacks at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.  Virtually all water sports have been suspended at the Red Sea resort following the attacks.  One of the tourists is believed to be in a critical condition in hospital in the Egyptian capital, Cairo.  The authorities are searching for an oceanic white tip shark, which is believed to have carried out the attacks.  They want to capture the shark and release it into the open sea.  The Associated Press news agency quoted a local conservation official, Mohammed Salem, as saying all the victims were Russian.  The suspension of diving and water sports applies to all but a small area around Sharm el-Sheikh.  Attacks by oceanic white tip sharks are extremely rare and shark attacks of any kind are very unusual in the Red Sea.  The BBC Cairo correspondent, Jon Leyne, says it is one of the most popular areas in the world for diving, so a decision to suspend water sports there would not have been taken lightly."
507,"Mismanagement of the scheme, designed to benefit working parents on low incomes, had ""caused hardship or distress"" to some, Mr Blair conceded.  One-third of claimants were overpaid and pushed into poverty when asked to repay, Citizens Advice reported.  And the Parliamentary Ombudsman accused Paymaster General Dawn Primarolo of not giving MPs a clear picture.  Both reports call for overpayments to be written off.  In an emergency statement to MPs, Ms Primarolo said the government was already writing off overpayments which are attributable to a department error.  She said that she had asked HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to suspend the recovery of overpayments where there is a dispute between the HMRC and the tax credit claimant.  CAB's damning report - based on 150,000 cases handled by the charity, which runs the Citizens Advice Bureaux - said that HMRC had ""failed to live up to its own standards of information, clarity and efficiency of service"" in the administration of tax credits.  One of the chief gripes reported to the CAB was overpayment, which topped £500 in more than half the cases.  The Office for National Statistics recently reported that of £13.5bn paid out last year, £1.9bn consisted of overpayments. CAB said the ""huge overpayments"" were due to HMRC system failings.  The charity called on the government to give an amnesty to people who had received tax credit overpayments, instead of trying to claim them back.  Meanwhile, in her report, Parliamentary Ombudsman Ann Abraham accused Ms Primarolo of failing to give accurate information when questioned about overpayments in the House of Commons in February.  Ms Abraham also said she was unable to say how many overpayments were due to government mistakes and how many were down to delays in claimants reporting a change in circumstances.  But her report echoed CAB's call for an amnesty on the recovery of overpayments, particularly those caused by official errors in the first two years of the scheme.  ""This would be a sensible and proportionate response to the situation and would give much-needed relief to people who, in many cases, have been caused considerable distress and hardship,"" she added.  Ms Primarolo said the system, which has benefited more than six million families and 10 million children, was not in ""complete collapse"".  She stressed she had been clear about the extent of the problems. ""Before that date and since that date I have continued to acknowledge that there were problems...I have made it clear in parliament that there are issues with the IT system and the administrative system,"" she said.  The Shadow Conservative Chancellor, George Osborne, called on Ms Primarolo to appear before the House of Commons to explain the handling of tax credit overpayments.  ""It is a scandalous that a system meant to help people is causing so much hardship and distress, to the point where people are having to borrow money from loan sharks to repay money sent to them in error,"" Mr Osborne said.  David Laws, the Liberal Democrat Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said that the reports showed that the design of the system was ""flawed.""  Mr Laws added that the call to write off overpayments was ""sensible and logical""."

509,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A British resident detained at Guantanamo Bay for more than four years has said he is ""extraordinarily happy to be home"" in the UK. Ethiopian-born Binyam Mohamed, 30, was released on Monday afternoon after he landed at RAF Northolt in London and underwent questioning by police. Mr Mohamed says he was tortured while in custody on suspicion of terrorism. He said his worst moment was when he realised his alleged torturers were receiving material from UK agents. Mr Mohamed arrived at lunchtime after a nine hour flight from the US-owned detention camp in Cuba. He was questioned for nearly five hours, before being driven off to an unknown destination arranged for him by his legal team. The Home Office said he would be given temporary admission until a decision is made on whether he can stay permanently in the UK. Col Yvonne Bradley, the US military lawyer who has worked for Mr Mohamed's release, told a press conference he had lost ""at least 40 to 50 pounds"" and would need time to recover from his prison ordeal. She added that mentally ""he was not in the best condition"". Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Clive Stafford Smith, director of legal charity Reprieve which represented Mr Mohamed, said his client was now looking forward to recovering in peace and to spending time with his sister, who he had not seen for seven years. Mr Stafford Smith said ""He [Binyam Mohamed] is just extremely happy now. He comes out of Guantanamo extremely grateful for all the support that he's had in a very dark time."" He added: ""He's not angry, he's sad, he's lost seven years of his life... I think he's just very grateful to Britain for having him back. ""He just wants to go to a place we've got him for tonight where he can be by himself with his sister and he can try to get his life together again."" But Mr Stafford Smith also said Britain was in part culpable for abuse suffered by Mr Mohamed. He said: ""Britain knew he was being abused and left him there and he ended up going to Morocco for two years of the most horrific nightmare imaginable. The very people who I had hoped would come to my rescue, I later realised, had allied themselves with my abusers    ""The least we owe to him is to give him his home back because he lost his home due to that process."" In an earlier statement Mr Mohamed said the worst moment of his ordeal was when he realised British intelligence agents were feeding information to his torturers. He said in the statement: ""I have met with British intelligence in Pakistan. I had been open with them. Yet the very people who I had hoped would come to my rescue, I later realised, had allied themselves with my abusers."" The former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, said the government had to do something ""fairly substantial"" in order to bring speculation of collusion to an end. He said: ""These are very serious allegations. Either they are true, in which case they need to be pursued, or they're not in fact true. It's a misunderstanding or an exaggeration, in which case the sooner people know that the better."" Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he was pleased Mr Mohamed had returned to the UK. He said: ""We very much welcome President Obama's commitment to close Guantanamo Bay and I see today's return of Binyam Mohamed as the first step towards that shared goal."" A Foreign Office spokesman said the allegations that British officials were complicit in Mr Mohamed's alleged torture were currently being examined by the Attorney General. He stressed the allegations about torture were raised with the US authorities a year ago and ""discussions were ongoing"". Mr Mohamed was held in captivity for a total of seven years - four of them in Guantanamo - after being arrested in Pakistan in 2002. He had lived in the UK from the age of 15. The US had accused Mr Mohamed of involvement in a plot to detonate a ""dirty bomb"" in America, but the charges were dropped in October last year. The US Department of Justice said that his release was ""consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice"". Earlier this year Mr Mohamed went on a month-long hunger strike at Guantanamo and his legal team said he was ""close to starvation"". But last weekend he was declared well enough to travel back to the UK by a team of British officials who had visited him. His lawyers insist he poses no risk to the UK. One other UK resident, Shaker Abdur-Raheem Aamer, remains in Guantanamo Bay after being detained in Afghanistan in 2001. Two other Guantanamo inmates claim to have been living in the UK prior to their detention, but those claims are disputed.     "
510,"The Nobel peace prize winner Mohamed ElBaradei has launched a new political party in Egypt.  The Constitution Party marks a return to public life for Mr ElBaradei, who is a former head of the IAEA, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.  But the new party's launch comes too late for it to field a candidate in next month's presidential election.  Mr ElBaradei said its aim was to unite Egyptians behind democracy, and to take power in four years time.  He told reporters that the new party would be above ideology, and was keen to avoid labelling it as ""liberal"".  But the BBC's Jon Leyne says it is clearly designed to challenge Islamist politicians who were the big winners in parliamentary elections earlier this year, and who could soon win the presidency.  Mohamed ElBaradei was careful not to define his new party as secular or liberal. He said it was to be a party to unite all Egyptians, without ideology. But the clear aim is to challenge the Islamists, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood, who have made the running in Egyptian politics in the year since the revolution was led by young liberals. The new grouping is being called the Constitution Party. That shows the prime objective is to get a new democratic system in place. Then, in the space of four years, Mr ElBaradei hopes the party will have built itself up as an electoral force to be reckoned with. The opening launch was attended by members of some of the many smaller, mostly liberal parties who have not done so well in the last year. They may have decided already that this is the moment for them to come together.  He hopes that it will be able to attract millions of members, and that it will unite the youth groups behind last year's uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak, and also to prepare them for a future political role.  ""The time has come to start a comprehensive political process to achieve the goals of the revolution,"" he said, adding that he wanted ""to rescue the great revolution that has been derailed and is almost stillborn.""  Egypt is currently ruled by a military-backed government which has promised to hand over power to the winner of the forthcoming presidential elections.  In January Mr ElBaradei ruled himself out of running for the presidency this year, saying a fair vote would be impossible in such a chaotic transitional period.  Enthusiastic supporters of the Nobel laureate gathered outside the news conference to show their approval of the new party.  Our correspondent says there was an impressive turnout for the launch.  That suggests he may have found a formula that could begin to unite the many different groups who led the revolution last year, but have since lost out in the race for power."

512,"By BBC Sport Online's Stuart Roach Wimbledon's rapid elevation from zeros to heroes is one of the great football fairytales. But success came at a cost for the modest south London club as they quickly outgrew their Plough Lane home, plunging them into a nomadic football existence. Ten years after moving out, Wimbledon are still looking for a permanent place to call home. Finally, it seems as though they may have found it - 80 miles from where their treasure hunt first began. The adventure began in 1977, when Wimbledon were elected to the Football League at the expense of Workington. Since then, it has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions for Dons fans as huge climbs have been followed by gut-wrenching dips. Here, BBC Sport Online charts the milestone years in Wimbledon's league history: 1977: On 20 August, the Dons share a 3-3 draw with Halifax at Plough Lane in their first Football League match as a modest mid-table finish marks a year of consolidation. 1979: The start of a yo-yo five-year spell for the Dons as they clinch promotion to Division Three, finishing third behind Reading and Grimsby. 1980: Wimbledon's joy is short-lived as Dario Gradi's side struggle to come to terms with life in a higher division and are relegated after finishing bottom. One ray of sunshine is the 7-2 FA Cup first-round victory over Windsor and Eton, to this day the biggest cup win in the side's history. 1981: Gradi is replaced by Dave Bassett on New Year's Day, starting one of the greatest chapters in the Dons' history. Bassett wins promotion at the first attempt, guiding the side to fourth and sealing a return to Division Three. 1982: The up-and-down run goes on as Bassett's side are relegated once again on goal difference behind Walsall. 1983: Bassett inspires another resurgence from his side - and this time it is the start of something special. Dons win Division Four at a canter, clocking up 98 points to finish eight points clear of Hull. 1984: The climb continues. Dons secure a second-successive promotion by finishing runners-up in Division Three behind Oxford. 1986: After just one year of consolidation, Bassett's boys win promotion to football's top flight along with Division One champions Norwich and runners-up Charlton. 1987: A superb first season in Division One sees the Dons clinch a top-six place. Normally, that would have meant Uefa Cup football for Bassett's self-styled Crazy Gang, but the ban on English teams in Europe robbed them of their chance. Bassett's love affair with the club is brought to an end as he is tempted away by Division One rivals and is replaced by Bobby Gould. 1988: No Wimbledon fan will ever forget this year. Dave Beasant's penalty save and Lawrie Sanchez's flicked header secure one of the biggest shocks in FA Cup final history as Gould and Don Howe mastermind a tactical victory over Liverpool. The 1-0 Wembley win denies Liverpool the double and clinches a memorable year for Gould's Dons following a seventh-place finish in Division One, but Liverpool gain some revenge with a 2-1 win in the Charity Shield. Planning permission is granted by Merton District Council for a 20,000 all-seater stadium on a disused sewage works at Wandle Valley. 1990: Control of Merton Council changes hands from Conservative to Labour and Wandle Valley is turned into a car park. 1991: As significant a year as '88 but for very different reasons. Dons' rapid rise means the club have effectively grown too big for their roots. The Taylor Report, released in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy, orders the rebuilding of grounds and the cost of replacing the Plough Lane terraces is too high. With no room to expand, the club move out of Plough Lane and agree a temporary ground-share plan with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. With an already modest following, Wimbledon's gates are further hit by their move across London but Merton Council's recommendation of a move to a 2,000-acre site at Beddington Lane falls through. 1992 The search for a new home is well and truly on. Chairman Sam Hammam's persistent approaches to the council are continually rebuffed and Wimbledon are forced to come up with new ideas.

513,"By BBC Sport Online's Stuart Roach Wimbledon's rapid elevation from zeros to heroes is one of the great football fairytales. But success came at a cost for the modest south London club as they quickly outgrew their Plough Lane home, plunging them into a nomadic football existence. Ten years after moving out, Wimbledon are still looking for a permanent place to call home. Finally, it seems as though they may have found it - 80 miles from where their treasure hunt first began. The adventure began in 1977, when Wimbledon were elected to the Football League at the expense of Workington. Since then, it has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions for Dons fans as huge climbs have been followed by gut-wrenching dips. Here, BBC Sport Online charts the milestone years in Wimbledon's league history: 1977: On 20 August, the Dons share a 3-3 draw with Halifax at Plough Lane in their first Football League match as a modest mid-table finish marks a year of consolidation. 1979: The start of a yo-yo five-year spell for the Dons as they clinch promotion to Division Three, finishing third behind Reading and Grimsby. 1980: Wimbledon's joy is short-lived as Dario Gradi's side struggle to come to terms with life in a higher division and are relegated after finishing bottom. One ray of sunshine is the 7-2 FA Cup first-round victory over Windsor and Eton, to this day the biggest cup win in the side's history. 1981: Gradi is replaced by Dave Bassett on New Year's Day, starting one of the greatest chapters in the Dons' history. Bassett wins promotion at the first attempt, guiding the side to fourth and sealing a return to Division Three. 1982: The up-and-down run goes on as Bassett's side are relegated once again on goal difference behind Walsall. 1983: Bassett inspires another resurgence from his side - and this time it is the start of something special. Dons win Division Four at a canter, clocking up 98 points to finish eight points clear of Hull. 1984: The climb continues. Dons secure a second-successive promotion by finishing runners-up in Division Three behind Oxford. 1986: After just one year of consolidation, Bassett's boys win promotion to football's top flight along with Division One champions Norwich and runners-up Charlton. 1987: A superb first season in Division One sees the Dons clinch a top-six place. Normally, that would have meant Uefa Cup football for Bassett's self-styled Crazy Gang, but the ban on English teams in Europe robbed them of their chance. Bassett's love affair with the club is brought to an end as he is tempted away by Division One rivals and is replaced by Bobby Gould. 1988: No Wimbledon fan will ever forget this year. Dave Beasant's penalty save and Lawrie Sanchez's flicked header secure one of the biggest shocks in FA Cup final history as Gould and Don Howe mastermind a tactical victory over Liverpool. The 1-0 Wembley win denies Liverpool the double and clinches a memorable year for Gould's Dons following a seventh-place finish in Division One, but Liverpool gain some revenge with a 2-1 win in the Charity Shield. Planning permission is granted by Merton District Council for a 20,000 all-seater stadium on a disused sewage works at Wandle Valley. 1990: Control of Merton Council changes hands from Conservative to Labour and Wandle Valley is turned into a car park. 1991: As significant a year as '88 but for very different reasons. Dons' rapid rise means the club have effectively grown too big for their roots. The Taylor Report, released in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy, orders the rebuilding of grounds and the cost of replacing the Plough Lane terraces is too high. With no room to expand, the club move out of Plough Lane and agree a temporary ground-share plan with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. With an already modest following, Wimbledon's gates are further hit by their move across London but Merton Council's recommendation of a move to a 2,000-acre site at Beddington Lane falls through. 1992 The search for a new home is well and truly on. Chairman Sam Hammam's persistent approaches to the council are continually rebuffed and Wimbledon are forced to come up with new ideas. Hammam reveals plans for proposed moves to Tolworth and Brixton, but insists the club will be totally renamed in protest at the lack of council support. 1992: The Greyhound Racing Association offer to redevelop the Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium into a 15,000-seater venue for dogs and football. 1994: Wimbledon's eighth season in the top flight is their best-ever. Now playing under the superstar-status banner of the Premier League, Dons secure another top six finish, ahead of Liverpool, Everton and Spurs.

514,"Jurors at Southwark Crown Court found Guy Harrison, 39, had not committed a public nuisance offence during his rooftop protest on 27 September 2005.  Speaking outside the court, the amateur mountaineer from West Sussex, said the ""fight will continue"" after his acquittal on a public nuisance charge.  He said: ""I'm absolutely delighted at today's outcome which shows yet again the only form of justice in this country is trial by jury.""  Jurors heard he had used a Guy Fawkes exhibition to reconnoitre the place, before planning the protest in such a way as to cause the ""minimum amount of disruption"".  Once on the roof helicopter owner Mr Harrison unfurled a 30ft banner declaring: ""Does Blair care? For Fawkes sake change family law.""  The prosecution argued that Mr Harrison risked his life, those of others and tied up emergency services as a result of his protest.  But Mr Harrison rejected those claims and said his stunt highlighted security flaws in the House of Parliament.  Fathers4Justice founder Matt O'Connor warned the organisation planned to stage several more events before Christmas."
515,"The plan only got as far as what police called the ""chattering stage"", BBC correspondent Ben Ando said. There has been no kidnap attempt and no arrests.  The Sun said police believed a fringe section of campaign group Fathers 4 Justice discussed the idea but did not have the ability to do it.  Fathers 4 Justice has distanced itself from what it called a ""grotesque"" plan.  Group founder Matt O'Connor said the news might force him to consider dismantling the group - a press conference will be held on Thursday to announce its future.  ""It puts into question the whole existence of this organisation because I certainly wouldn't want to be associated with anything like this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Mr O'Connor said he was aware that Scotland Yard anti-terrorist police had been investigating some former members of the group last month.  He said he believed Fathers 4 Justice had ""contributed to the debate and raised awareness about the plight of children denied access to their fathers in the family courts"".  He added: ""I am very angry and upset that this organisation has been undermined by the very people it is supposed to serve.""  Officially police are making no comment, and Downing Street has refused to confirm or deny the newspaper report.  The Sun claimed the plan was to hold Leo for a short period, as a ""symbolic gesture"" to highlight the cause of fathers denied access to their children.  Graham Dudman, the paper's managing editor, told the BBC: ""The police took this very seriously because, of course, Fathers 4 Justice have been involved in some pretty spectacular stunts recently - breaching security at Buckingham Palace, at Downing Street, and also the throwing of the flour bomb at the prime minister in the House of Commons.""  Security analyst Charles Shoebridge said Fathers 4 Justice had no record of ""major criminality"" and that this plot would have been ""a very different matter - child abduction is itself a very serious offence"".  ""Let's not forget somebody could easily be killed in an attempt like this - not just the Fathers 4 Justice campaigners, if indeed they were Fathers 4 Justice, but an innocent passer-by could be hit in police crossfire,"" said the former Metropolitan Police anti-terrorism officer.  Ben Ando said police had been investigating extreme groups linked to Fathers 4 Justice for some time.  ""The plan only got as far as what they [police] called the chattering stage,"" he said.  ""No real reconnaissance was carried out, no actual kidnap attempt was made, no-one has been arrested, and the police are not convinced those at the centre of the alleged plan had the capability to carry it out."""
516,"Fringe elements of the group were said to have talked about holding Leo Blair, five, to highlight the cause of fathers denied access to their children.  Mr O'Connor told Channel 4 News the group could not continue after negative publicity generated by the allegations.  The group became known with a number of protests at public landmarks.  A Downing Street spokesman has said there will be no comment on the announcement.  Mr O'Connor said: ""Three years after starting the organisation, we are going to cease all operations and bring the campaign to a close purely on the basis of what's happened.""  He added that in recent months ""extremist elements"" had ""undermined the position and credibility of an organisation that was flying along for the first two years of its existence"".  Earlier the group had said it was suspending its activities pending an inquiry into the claims in the Sun newspaper regarding the prime minister's youngest son.  Mr O'Connor said he was now ""past caring"" what happened to Fathers 4 Justice.  ""I want to get a good night's sleep. This is not what I wanted. I don't want to be associated with an organisation getting headlines like this,"" he said.  The group expelled 30 people last year in a bid to get rid of so-called extreme elements.  The organisation, which was committed to improving the rights of fathers who are estranged from their children, had staged a number of headline-grabbing stunts in recent years.  Protests included members throwing dyed flour at the prime minister in the Commons chamber and a protester dressed as Batman perching on a Buckingham Palace ledge for around four hours.  Police sources told the BBC that they were aware of a plan to abduct Leo, but said the plot only got as far as the ""chattering stage"".  There has been no kidnap attempt and no arrests regarding the matter."
517,"Presenter Eamonn Holmes was led from the stage as Fathers 4 Justice members made their way on to the set.  The National Lottery: Jet Set was delayed for several minutes before the draw for the £17m jackpot was resumed.  Campaign group Fathers 4 Justice said the evening marked the ""dramatic return"" of the protest group.  The group appeared to have disbanded in January after some of its members were accused of allegedly plotting to kidnap Prime Minister Tony Blair's youngest son, Leo.  Guy Harrison, a spokesman for the paternal rights group, said it was the group's duty to warn parents about family law.  Mr Harrison added: ""The lottery is a metaphor for what can happen to any parent, mother or father, and their children, at the hands of the secret family courts.""  Afterwards presenter Holmes said it had been a ""scary moment"".  Alan Dedicoat, the so-called voice of the National Lottery balls, told the BBC: ""We just had a kerfuffle. What appeared to be fireworks or something going off in the studio.  ""The cameras moved to one side. Eamonn was pushed to one side at one stage I think.""  He added: ""And the next minute we had to put a caption up and I was left talking to millions and millions of viewers trying to explain what was going on without necessarily being able to see all of it myself.""  Later, Holmes said the protesters had been ""well-orchestrated"".  He said: ""About six protesters ran out of the audience, very well positioned, very well orchestrated, they knew exactly the positions to be in and they tried to, well, I think, destroy the lottery machines.  ""Fathers 4 Justice was the campaign and, you know, I think for the audience a very scary moment, whatever empathy or sympathy many people may have with Fathers 4 Justice, again, you've a lot of very shaken, disturbed people, both watching at home and in the studio."""
518,"A small piece of Scotland is to be returned to its original owners after completing its part in a piece of Scottish legal history.  The former military base at Camp Zeist in Holland has been under Scottish jurisdiction for more than three years.  The base was converted into a prison and a courtroom to provide the venue for the Lockerbie trial - the largest and most expensive ever conducted under Scots law.  Now the site is set to return to the ownership of the Dutch government - possibly as early as Friday. No decision has yet been taken as to what will happen to the complex and its buildings. However, Scottish Executive officials have been involved in negotiations for the handover of the site. A spokesman said: ""We have certain commitments to hand it back in such a way that they can use it and we have come to an agreement on how to do that."" Camp Zeist has a history of foreign involvement, forming part of a US military base until 1994. Located about eight miles from Utrecht in central Holland, it was chosen as the best location for the Lockerbie trial in late 1998. The first of the 1,000 Scottish police officers who have been seconded to guard the site arrived in Holland in April 1999 - the same month that the two accused handed themselves over to the United Nations. The trial of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, which began in May 2000, was the first to be held under Scots law on foreign soil.  In preparation for the hearing a former school was converted into a courthouse and the camp gymnasium became a media centre. The prison which held the two accused was created on the ground floor of a former medical clinic, which was originally constructed as a hardened nuclear, biological and chemical shelter. The following January the three Scottish judges delivered their verdict, clearing Fhimah but finding al-Megrahi guilty of murder. However, that did not signal the end of Camp Zeist's role as the Libyan quickly lodged an appeal against the conviction. That case was heard by a panel of five appeal judges between 23 January and 14 February. They then retired to consider their verdict, which was announced on Thursday - signalling the end for the Scottish presence in Holland."
519,"A police car was seen outside the NPD's Berlin office on Wednesday German police are investigating whether a string of letters from the far-right NPD party to politicians from immigrant backgrounds have incited racial hatred. Dozens of politicians of foreign descent are running as candidates in Germany's election this Sunday. The NPD reportedly sent 30 of them letters advising them to ""go home"". One recipient said the two-page letter contained a ""five-point plan"" for ""moving foreigners gradually back to their home countries"". The letters were signed by a non-existent ""commissioner for the repatriation of foreigners"". ""We are investigating whether there is a suspicion of inciting racial hatred,"" said Martin Steltner, spokesman for the Berlin state prosecutor's office, quoted by Reuters news agency. The National Democratic Party (NPD) leader in Berlin, Joerg Haehnel, defended the letters, which were sent at the weekend. I have only German citizenship. I have no country to go to    ""As part of a democracy we're entitled to say if something doesn't suit us in this country,"" Reuters quoted him as saying. One recipient, Green party politician Oezcan Mutlu, said he was ""shocked"" to get the letter. ""This is my home town. I am German. I have only German citizenship. I have no country to go to,"" he told the BBC's Oana Lungescu. Mr Mutlu, a lawmaker in the Berlin state parliament, is used to hate mail. ""Until recently I got them from individuals anonymously, but this time a party with the name on it is addressing me privately,"" he said. ""You don't know what they can do if they have your address. I'm not afraid at all, but I have to be careful."" Of some 50 million Germans eligible to vote in Sunday's poll, about one in 10 has an immigrant background. Many are ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union, while others are Turks whose parents came to Germany to help rebuild the country after the war. The NPD, which has around 7,000 members, has been polling poorly ahead of Sunday's election. It has no seats in Germany's national parliament but has some seats in regional assemblies. The NPD uses language eerily reminiscent of Nazi propaganda, our correspondent reports. The letter says foreigners should be excluded from the welfare system and banned from owning land in Germany.     "
520,"Up to one in 10 members of the English Democrats have converted from the British National Party, their leader has told the BBC.  Robin Tilbrook said it was ""perfectly fair"" for people to ""change their minds"" and join a ""moderate, sensible English nationalist party"".  He said between 200 and 300 of the English Democrats' members were ex-BNP, most having joined a year or so ago.  Peter Davies, who has served as English Democrat mayor of Doncaster since 2009, recently left the party, saying it was ""odd, to say the least, and, to me personally, unacceptable"" that former BNP members were being ""hoovered up"".  But, speaking on BBC Two's Daily Politics, Mr Tilbrook, said: ""Peter is now someone who's an ex-supporter of six parties and he's simply one of those people who's quite difficult to work with. He glorifies in the title of being the 'maverick mayor'.""  He added that the recruitment of former BNP members had been ""fairly small"" and had mainly ""happened a year or so ago"".  Mr Tilbrook also said: ""I think probably out of about 3,000 members that we've got, we've probably got 200 or 300 that are ex-BNP.  ""As long as they are genuine converts to what we are talking about, I'm not bothered about it...  ""The fact is that people are able to change their mind and they should be allowed to, within reason.  ""What you are looking at is a situation where people are becoming more and more concerned about English national identity.""  The English Democrats call for more equal public spending on services in England and Scotland, withdrawal from the European Union, the deportation of all illegal immigrants and making St George's Day a national holiday in England.  Mr Tilbrook told Daily Politics: ""It's important that there should be a moderate, sensible English nationalist party that represents that view. We are that party.""  He added: ""We have stood non-white candidates. We are perfectly happy to do so and we are perfectly happy to have people join us who are genuine converts to our party. Any sensible party would do so.  ""The Conservative Party undoubtedly has people in it who are ex-BNP as well. Labour has at least two councillors who are ex-BNP activists and, in one case, a person who was a BNP councillor.  ""It's a completely ridiculous point to say that you shouldn't allow people to change their minds. This is grown-up politics. People change their minds. It's perfectly fair and reasonable that they should do so.""  No BNP spokesman was available for comment.  On its website, the party describes the English Democrats as ""a part of the liberal-left attack on our nation"". It adds: ""They are just another safety valve, designed to lead good people up a blind alley, and to divide the true nationalist cause.""  The English Democrats are fielding 38 candidates in next week's English local elections, 23 of them in Kent."
521,"Tony Blair has never used the phrase ""people's peers"", Downing Street has insisted. Fifteen non-political crossbenchers - dubbed ""people's peers"" - were appointed last year in a blaze of publicity.    The people selected are almost exclusively members of the metropolitan elite    The idea was to throw the House of Lords open to ordinary people. But critics have called the scheme a sham after the new peers' voting and attendance records were exposed in a national newspaper. The scheme has also come under fire for awarding seats to members of a privileged elite rather than ordinary voters. In May 2000, Tony Blair said the new Appointment Commission would ensure a House of Lords that was ""more representative of our diverse society"". ""The Commission will look for suitable candidates in a wider field than up to now,"" he added. But the final selection included seven knights and a number of leading academics and scientists. Downing Street has said it did not invent the phrase ""people's peers"".    It is doubtful a postman or a lollipop person could afford to give up their job to come and sit in the chamber every day    A spokeswoman told BBC News Online the candidates had been selected by an independent Appointment Commission - not the prime minister. Labour backbencher Diane Abbott said the scheme has been a major disappointment and only strengthened the case for a wholly elected Lords. ""It was sold as a way of letting ordinary people join the House of Lords,"" Ms Abbott told BBC News Online. ""They were meant to contribute from an ordinary person's perspective. ""But the people selected are almost exclusively members of the metropolitan elite."" She added: ""They clearly haven't lived up to their billing. ""It strengthens the argument for a wholly elected House of Lords."" According to the Daily Mirror, BP Amoco chief executive Lord Browne has made just one speech since his appointment and has never voted. Others, including Lord Adebowale, Lord Sutherland and Baroness Greenfield, were also accused of making meagre contributions. Leading biologist and President of the Royal Society Lord May - who the Mirror said ""needs to pull his weight more"" - said he thought the criticisms were ""not unreasonable"". But he said the critics had underestimated the amount of work peers do behind the scenes. ""The work of the House of Lords is about a great deal more than turning up in the chamber and making the odd remark,"" he told BBC News Online. He had become involved in the work of a select committee and had already made useful contribuitions to the Export Control Bill, despite working only one a day a week in the Lords, he said. Peers' pay had also been greatly exaggerated. ""It is doubtful a postman or a lollipop person could afford to give up their job to come and sit in the chamber every day,"" Lord May told News Online. A spokeswoman for the Appointment Commission said the peers had been selected for the expert knowledge they could bring to the Lords. ""They attend when they have something to contribute. ""The idea was to remove some of the patronage traditionally associated with the House of Lords. ""To make the process more open and accountable,"" she said."
522,"Dr Williams says it is vital that politics is not totally devalued as a calling The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned the ""systematic humiliation"" of MPs over their expenses is a threat to democracy in Britain. Dr Rowan Williams said the daily press revelations could erode people's confidence in the political system. Writing in The Times, he said: ""Many will now be wondering whether the point has not been adequately made."" His comments came as the ex-SAS officer who gave the expenses data to the Daily Telegraph defended their publication. John Wick, who passed the details on from an anonymous source, said he had ""no regrets"" about exposing the expenses system's ""rotten core"". ""Parliament will be a better place, society will be a better place,"" he added. In his article, Dr Williams agreed that action was needed to restore confidence in the political system and that the ""no rules were broken"" mentality that featured in many MPs' responses represented a ""basic problem"" in contemporary moral thinking. But he argued the point had now been made and that further revelations could have a damaging effect. ""The continuing systematic humiliation of politicians itself threatens to carry a heavy price in terms of our ability to salvage some confidence in our democracy,"" he said. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. It was important to preserve the idea that serving as a politician could be what he described as ""a calling worthy of the most generous instincts"", he added. Times columnist and former MP Matthew Parris told the BBC that although he did not think there should be a press ""ceasefire or amnesty"" with regard to expenses, it was important the situation was assessed rationally. ""I do think we need to stand back a little, pause, draw breath and try to distinguish between the vast majority of Members of Parliament - many of whom have pushed things a bit further perhaps than they should have within the rules... and just a few of whom are absolutely crooks,"" he said. Aiming ""general kicks"" at all MPs regardless of their behaviour was ""bad for Parliament, bad for democracy and bad for us"", he added. But Labour peer Lord Campbell Savours, one of the original campaigners for the Freedom of Information Act, said the archbishop's claims that the expenses controversy threatened democracy were ""rubbish"". ""It's not undermining democracy at all. It's not threatening democracy,"" he said. ""It will lead to a change in the expenses system in the House of Commons, which many Members of Parliament would welcome."" John Wick said he felt compelled to release the expenses information Dr Williams voiced his fears after Tory MP Nadine Dorries complained of a ""McCarthy-style witch-hunt"" of MPs and suggested someone might commit suicide because of the pressure. Further allegations about Tory and Labour politicians' expenses were published in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. The paper reported that shadow business secretary Jonathan Djanogly claimed £5,000 for a set of automatic gates for his home and nearly £13,000 for gardening. Mr Djanogly told the BBC he had acted ""credibly and reasonably"", but had decided to repay £25,000 of the £77,104 he has claimed in total because of public anger. The paper also accused Northern Ireland Minister Paul Goggins of allowing a university friend to live rent-free in a home paid for by the taxpayer. But Mr Goggins told the BBC the arrangements were based on a ""30-year friendship"" with Chris Bain and due to the fact that Mr Bain had been the joint owner of the property for six years between 1997 and 2003. Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin also reportedly used £50,000 in expenses to pay his sister-in-law rent for the property he uses as his constituency home. Mr Jenkin told the BBC he was ""devastated"" by the criticism and that there was no suggestion of property speculation and that he was just paying ""an honest and reasonable rent"". The paper also turned the spotlight on Labour MP Khalid Mahmood for allegedly claiming £1,350 for a stay in a five-star west London hotel with his girlfriend.     "
523,"Mr Jenkin says he will repay the money if necessary Tory MP Bernard Jenkin has been asked to pay back £63,250 by expenses auditor Sir Thomas Legg. It is the highest amount known to have been requested after an audit of MPs' claims on second homes expenses. Mr Jenkin had claimed expenses to rent a property in his North Essex constituency from his sister-in-law. He said the Fees Office was aware and he had not been told rules on renting from family had changed in 2006, but he would repay the money if he has to. Downing Street asked Sir Thomas to review all MPs' claims under the controversial second homes allowance when the expenses scandal broke in May. In the last few weeks about 600 MPs have received letters from him, seeking further information about claims, recommending some money be repaid, or telling them their expenses present no further issues. He has also said there should have been annual limits on claims for gardening and cleaning - and recommended MPs who claimed more should repay the difference, although the claims were legitimate at the time. But in Mr Jenkin's case the request relates to rent claimed on a property owned by his sister-in-law. MPs were banned from renting from relatives in 2006. No question has been raised about my honesty, integrity or openness    MPs were given three weeks to respond to the letters and it is understood that Mr Jenkin has responded and asked Sir Thomas to drop the demand because Commons authorities had sanctioned the arrangement and had not told him the rules had changed. Mr Jenkin told his local newspaper, the East Anglian Daily Times: ""I have pointed out that the House of Commons Fees Office was fully aware from the outset that this was a family arrangement. ""I have sent Sir Thomas copies of the letters and emails which show I sought to keep within the letter and spirit of the rules at all times. ""No question has been raised about my honesty, integrity or openness and I have reiterated to him that I will pay back whatever is finally recommended at the end of the process."" Gordon Brown has been asked to repay more than £12,000 he claimed - much of which relates to cleaning claims which exceeded Sir Thomas's retrospective limits. The biggest amount known to be repaid by a single MP so far is £43,674 by minister Phil Hope. He paid back the money in the summer, before the audit, after being criticised for the amount he spent refurbishing his flat. It was within the rules but he said his constituents' response had been a ""massive blow"". Conservative sources told the BBC said Mr Jenkin's case was complicated and they would have to await Sir Thomas's final verdict. Tory frontbencher Ken Clarke had been asked to repay £4,733 by Sir Thomas, but after making representations in writing to him he was told a mistake had been made and it should have been £1,345.

There are also fears that a separate volcano, Mount Awu, may erupt in the north-east of the country.  More than 15,000 people have been evacuated from the area, amid warnings of impending volcanic activity.  An eyewitness on Mount Bromo told the BBC she was forced to scramble down from the crater when the volcano began spewing rocks and dark smoke on Tuesday afternoon.  Few people live in the immediate vicinity of the volcano, but visitors to the region often climb its slopes to watch the sunrise.  Far more people live near Mount Awu, on Sangihe island, which began spewing ash and smoke last week.  ""There is a lot of smoke coming out, and there are indications that it will erupt,"" a local official there said on Tuesday.  Those who have been evacuated from the slopes of Mount Awu have been taken to Tahuna, 15km (nine miles) to the south.  They are now sheltering in government offices and other public buildings.  More than 80% of residents in dangerous areas have now been evacuated, but some men have reportedly stayed behind to guard their villages.  Mount Awu is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, and has erupted repeatedly since the 17th century.  Nearly 3,000 people died when it blew up in 1812. The last major eruption was in 1966, when 40 people died and thousands were evacuated.  Indonesia is home to more than 100 active volcanoes, and minor eruptions are common.  It sits astride the geological fault line that runs around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, which is known as the ""Ring of Fire""."
526,"A theatre group in Germany has come under fire for allowing a white actor to paint his face and take the part of a black character on stage.  The technique - known as blackface - has been used by the Schlosspark Theatre in Berlin for its latest production, I'm not Rappaport.  Critics have likened the move to minstrel shows in the US, which traditionally lampooned black people.  But the theatre group has vehemently denied claims of racism.  The play is set in New York and depicts the friendship of two elderly men - African-American Midge Carter and Jewish Nat Moyer.  Director Thomas Schendel said they had been unable to find the right elderly black actor to play the role of Midge Carter so had opted for blacking-up 76-year-old white actor Joachim Bliese.  ""Many older black actors come from the music industry, and that wasn't a fit for the play as it wasn't a musical,"" he told The Local newspaper.  ""When we couldn't find an elderly black actor who fit the role and could speak with a perfect German accent, we opted for blackface make-up.""  He said he was saddened by the controversy: ""I tried to make a play about racism and ended up being called a racist"".  But his comments were dismissed by the advocacy group, Initiative for Black Germans.  ""There are more than enough black actors in Germany, especially in Berlin. Schendel is making excuses,"" said spokesman Tahir Della.  Although there is no history of minstrel shows in Germany, Mr Schendel says ""blackface is part of a theatre tradition"" in Germany.  And one member of staff at the 90-year-old Schlosspark Theatre told the BBC that in the 40 times I'm not Rappaport had been staged since 1987, a blacked-up actor had often been used - with no complaints.  However, groups representing Germany's black population, which numbers around 500,000, have accused some Germans of insensitivity over the issue of race in the past, the BBC's John McManus reports.  In September, a satirical comedian appeared blacked-up on a billboard poster as US President Barack Obama.  In 2009, Dresden Zoo had to apologise after naming a small baboon after Mr Obama."
527,"It is hoped the ""nettle knickers"" is the first step towards a commercial application for the plants.  Leicester's De Montfort University's ""Sting"" project is researching potential for nettle fibre as a crop and market.  The research is funded by Defra; and the Central Science Laboratory, in York, is also involved in the project.  Textile design student Alex Dear, 23, from Cambridge, wrote a dissertation on nettle fibre as part of a three-year textile design and production degree.  She has been modelling the camisole and knickers, which she designed herself.  She said: ""I investigated and tested the fibres and had the yarn made up.  Nettle yarn was used to make rucksacks for soldiers in the First World War.  Ms Dear said: ""It's not terribly comfortable when it's next to your skin, so anything you made from it would probably have to be lined.  Ray Harwood, Professor of Textile Engineering at De Montfort University, said nettles had great potential.  ""I am sure it would find a place in corporate clothing, workwear and the like."""
528,"Held as part of a charity beer festival at the Bottle Inn in the village of Marshwood near Crewkerne, the event attracts entrants from around the world.  As the competition's fame has spread, nettle eaters from as far as New York, Australia, Northern Ireland and Belgium make the trip to West Dorset.  As the huge bunches of stinging nettles arrive, the competitors face one hour of munching their way through the leaves, and the winner is whoever finishes with the most two foot stalks, stripped of their leaves.  Only nettles provided by the organisers can be eaten, competitors are not allowed to bring their own, no mouth numbing substances are permitted - although a swig of beer in between mouthfuls is always encouraged.  And for spectators, it makes for a bemusing sight. Competitors have described their unusual bar meal as tasting like anything from ""rancid salad with no dressing"" to ""a mixture of spinach and cow-pat"".  A previous winner of the contest is Ed Brooks, a regular at the Bottle Inn.  He won the contest by scoffing 48 feet of nettles and was thrilled with winning the title: ""Oh it's tremendous, amazing... I'm a bit peckish though!"".  Meanwhile Jo Carter from Weymouth and Liz Gray from Bath once both shared the women's title - they both ate exactly 26 feet of nettles.  The longest-nettle competition eventually turned into the World Nettle Eating Championships when one of the farmers, Alex Williams, promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his.  Although competitive nettle eating is something some may not seem as very palatable, nettles have been used by many top chefs, nettle tea is widely available, and they have long been used as a medicinal herb."
529,"Thousands of Georgians have protested in the capital Tbilisi against a gay rights rally being held to mark the international day against homophobia.  They broke through police barricades and carried stinging nettles with which to beat activists. Some posters read: ""We don't need Sodom and Gomorrah"".  Police were forced to bus the 50 or so activists out of the city centre to avoid further violence.  Several people, including a journalist and a police officer, were injured.  The protests followed comments from the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church.  Patriarch Ilia II had urged the authorities not to allow the gay pride rally to go ahead, saying it was a ""violation of the majority's rights"" and ""an insult"" to the Georgian nation.  This wasn't a crowd of right-wing extremists. These were ordinary Georgians: many were respectable-looking older women, well-dressed young men or elderly grandfathers. Led by priests from the Georgian Orthodox Church, with long white beards and dressed in flowing black cassocks, the fired-up crowd easily broke through police lines. Thousands of protesters then surged through, cheering and chanting, as the few dozen gay activists in the central square were hurriedly pushed onto buses by police. Young male protesters gave chase, throwing rocks at the windows or pursuing in cars. Those gay activists who managed to scramble onto the buses in time escaped. Others were not so lucky, and were chased down the streets or trapped in shops by angry mobs chanting anti-gay slogans.  He described homosexuality as a disease and compared it to drug addiction.  The BBC's Damien McGuinness in Tbilisi says the Patriarch is by far the most respected public figure in Georgia, with approval ratings consistently at around 90%.  All the anti-gay demonstrators our correspondent spoke to said the Patriarch's comments had inspired them to attend Friday's protest, which was organised with the help of Orthodox priests.  ""We won't allow these sick people to hold gay parades in our country,"" said one woman holding a bunch of nettles. ""It's against our traditions and morals.""  Such attempts to halt an officially-approved rally have dismayed gay activists and the authorities in Georgia.  ""These people [the activists] should have the right to express their views and to hold demonstrations,"" said Nino Bolkvadeze, a lawyer with the non-governmental organisation Identity.  A similar rally held last year ended in the same way.  Georgia - a former soviet republic - is keen to join the European Union.  There are concerns that this aspiration could be undermined if Georgia's authorities appear unable to guarantee sexual minorities the right to demonstrate safely, our correspondent says."
530,"Knuckledusters, hammers and a meat cleaver were among weapons retrieved after a brawl between rival biker gangs at Birmingham Airport, a court heard.  Up to 30 bikers fought inside a terminal building in January 2008, Birmingham Crown Court was told.  The prosecution said onlookers were left frightened and distressed following the battle between members of the Hells Angels and Outlaws gangs.  Twelve men deny charges of riot and an alternative charge of violent disorder.  Timothy Raggatt QC said the weapons were recovered after the violence during the evening of 20 January.  He told the court the two groups had a long-standing rivalry.  ""In the course of what happened, a variety or, in some cases quite alarming, weapons were used.  ""There were knives produced, there was certainly a machete produced and there were various blunt instruments,"" he said.  He said a number of people involved were injured, although no members of the public were hurt.  Seven of the men on trial are Outlaw members. The other five are known to be Hells Angels.

531,"Fighting began around the stadium almost two hours before kick-off A man has been stabbed in the chest during ""large-scale trouble"" involving hundreds of fans at West Ham's Carling Cup match against Millwall. Fights broke out at 1800 BST and were still raging five hours later. A 44-year-old man is stable after being stabbed in Priory Road at 2025 BST. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said missiles had been thrown at officers but none were injured. By 2300 BST several hundred West Ham fans had congregated outside the stadium chanting and bombarding police with crates and bottles. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The first pitch invasion was after West Ham's equaliser, while the second more serious invasion happened after they scored a penalty. It took officials about six minutes to clear about 50 people from the pitch and police had to redeploy within the stadium to tackle the invasion. West Ham won the game 3-1 after extra time, upon which there was a third invasion by hundreds of fans. About 200 riot police and at least 20 mounted officers were at the ground and a police helicopter circled the area. The Press Association quoted an unnamed 19-year-old saying he saw a police officer being kicked on the ground. The police spokesman said: ""There is large-scale trouble involving hundreds of fans which we are dealing with at the moment. About 50 fans invaded the pitch after West Ham equalised ""Officers are now containing it but there is still disorder. Hundreds of fans are estimated to be involved."" One pub reportedly had its windows broken by bricks during running battles across several streets up to half a mile from the stadium. Eyewitnesses told of hooligans trying to rip out bollards and lighting ""small fires"". Five arrests have been confirmed, including one for affray and one for breaching a banning order. BBC radio reporter Ben Jacobs, who was at the stadium, said: ""The trouble broke out outside the Tube station about 600 yards from the ground. ""There were [hundreds of] riot police and Millwall fans managed to break through the divide."" Tony, a steward at the game, told BBC Radio 5 live they were powerless to stop the violence. He said: ""When you have 2,900 Millwall fans it is really intimidating. ""There is not a lot you can do - you have to hope the police presence can help you out."" There were loads of people with bloodied faces    A 29-year-old man had to close his kebab shop in nearby Green Street for two hours. He said: ""All hell broke loose - it was very frightening. ""Bottles and bricks were being thrown from the back and some were hitting West Ham fans at the front. ""There were loads of people with bloodied faces."" Aaron Smith, from Hemel Hempstead, who was at the game, said: ""I saw one man cornered by at least a dozen Millwall fans before kick-off. Terrifying scenes."" And a Millwall fan told the BBC: ""It was like a war zone outside the stadium. There was fighting all round. ""I brought my kids with me tonight and they've seen some violence that is indescribable."" A Football Association spokesman said: ""We absolutely condemn the disorder. ""We expect all culprits to be banned from football for life - they have no place in our game.""     "
532,"Four men have been charged following the ""ferocious"" violence after Thursday's Millwall game, in which 47 officers were injured.  The trouble, involving between 600 and 900 Millwall fans, followed the club's bitter Division One play-off defeat by Birmingham City.  Police are considering suing the south London football club for damages after the ""vicious"" violence in which they came under a barrage of missiles for more than an hour.  However, club chairman Theo Paphitis said Millwall itself could not be blamed for the actions of a ""mindless minority"".  ""Where incidents occur away from the Den we do of course feel a moral responsibility,"" Mr Paphitis said.  ""But the problem of mob violence is not solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, it is a problem which plagues the whole of our society.""  Three of the men have been charged with public order offences.  They are: James Gavin Mullen, 19, of St Francis Avenue, Gravesend in Kent; Mark Bellchambers, 21, of Bradley Road, Enfield, north London, and John Cornelius Parker, 18, of Beldan Hall, Hallstead in Kent.  Mr Mullen and Mr Parker were bailed to appear before Greenwich magistrates on Wednesday, while Mr Bellchambers was bailed to re-appear at an east London police station at a date to be fixed.  Police also said Nigel Simon Haywood, 22, of Corser Street, Dudley, West Midlands was charged with breach of a banning order. He appeared before Greenwich magistrates on Friday.  A 25-year-old man and a 22-year-old man arrested outside the ground were warned for drunkenness, and a 40-year-old man was released with no further action, police said.  During the hour of violence crowds threw missiles, including bricks, paving stones, a chisel, flares and fireworks at police. Two cars were set alight.  Chief Superintendent Mike Humphrey said: ""This is my seventh season as commander for Millwall and this is the worst yet.""  A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said out of 36 mounted police officers, 24 were injured, and so were 24 horses.  She said one whole 21-strong unit of riot police was injured.  Nine of the injured were treated in hospital for injuries including a broken leg, arm and foot.  Sergeant Russell Lamb said the situation was ""like a battlefield"" and the most frightening he had been in.  ""I have done the poll tax and May Day riots and Wapping in the 1980s and I am in no doubt that it was one of the most unbelievable and violent situations I have been in.""  Millwall president Reg Burr vowed that any troublemakers would get a lifetime ban.  ""We will do anything we can to identify any troublemakers and the appropriate action will be taken - we will ban them for life,"" he said.  Police warned they had video footage of the disturbances and expected to make a significant number of arrests.  They said some of the violence must have been premeditated, as weapons had been stashed away ahead of the match."
533,"Claridge, 39, who had two spells as a player with Millwall, was only appointed as the successor to Dennis Wise on 21 June.  ""The board believe it was in the best interests of the club that this move was made quickly prior to the beginning of the season,"" said a club statement.  Claridge is said to be ""deeply disappointed and shocked"".  Lee, who had been brought to the club by Claridge and has yet to sign a contract, admitted he was shocked at the dismissal.  He said: ""Steve was going to ask them if I could help out with the coaching on a non-contract basis.  ""I left Steve with (former chairman) Theo Paphitis and set off back to the Midlands after the game with Gillingham on Tuesday.  ""Steve wanted to get the permission of the board to take me on, and the meeting ended with him being dismissed.  ""But I have not done anything wrong, to Steve or to anyone else. It's not in my make-up.""  The Lions drew 2-2 at home to Gillingham in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday, having been 2-0 down.  Claridge has overseen just four friendly games - two wins, a draw and a defeat.  The much-travelled striker succeeded Wise, who resigned in May due to differences with the incoming chairman Jeff Burnige.  But it has been a turbulent month at the club, with Burnige stepping down and several key players leaving the New Den since Claridge took over on 21 June."
534,"A professional footballer has been found guilty of murdering a man on a north-west London estate.  Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant, 26, shot dead Leon Labastide on the Stonebridge Park Estate in Harlesden in 2004, the Old Bailey was told.  Grant, who also played for Wycombe Wanderers and Bradford City, was involved in a series of ""tit-for-tat"" shootings on the estate, jurors heard.  Grant, who had denied murder, is due to be sentenced on Monday.  Gareth Downie, 25, from Markby Road, Birmingham, was also found guilty of murdering Mr Labastide.  And Damian Williams, 32, from Tower Bridge Road in Southwark, was convicted of conspiring with them to murder Mr Labastide.  The court heard that Mr Labastide's killing led to the murder of Jahmall Moore in 2005 and Grant's arrest.  Grant, from Shrewsbury Avenue, Kenton, north-west London, was later cleared of shooting Mr Moore, 22, who died in a hail of bullets fired by three gunmen.  He had also denied involvement in Mr Labastide's killing, claiming the 21-year-old was a friend, but was found guilty of murder following trials in December and this month.  Jurors heard trouble flared after a burglary in which three women were terrorised and it was suspected that £20,000 in drug money was taken.  A 16-year-old girl, who had been in the house, gave evidence under an assumed name.  Mr Labastide was rumoured to have been behind the burglary and Williams arranged for Grant and Downie to shoot him, the court was told.  Officers from Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime in the black community, believe as a result of the burglary there were up to 30 connected shooting incidents in the area.  Following the arrests of Grant and others, officers said shootings fell by almost 50% in the area.  Det Insp Steve Horsley said: ""Gavin Grant thought he had got away with murder.  ""He carried on his footballing career while, all along, he had blood on his hands.""  During the trial, Prosecutor Stephen Batten QC said many of the people involved in the case had been linked to shootings and drug dealing on the estate.  He said: ""Attitudes and standards are different. It is more the law of the jungle than the law of civilised England.""  Roberto Parchment, 24, originally convicted of Mr Moore's murder, was found guilty again following a retrial in December.  He was jailed for life again and ordered to serve the remainder of his 28-year sentence.  Downie and Williams will also be sentenced on Monday."
535,"Millwall Football Club said it ""will fight like Lions"" after Lewisham Council voted to sell land surrounding its stadium to property developers.  The New Bermondsey development will see the creation of 2,400 homes, community facilities and a new overground station around The Den.  Chairman John Berylson said the club had its own building plans and is ""not going to give in"".  The cabinet was recommended to back the decision.  About 80 businesses, including Millwall, are based in the area where the scheme is planned.  The New Den stadium will not be altered but other land used by the club, including a car park and the Millwall Community Trust, would be taken over by developers.  The club had put forward its own proposals for the land, which it said would ""protect the long-term future of this club"".  Millwall's chairman said the decision was ""akin to dropping two divisions"" and accused Renewal of ""point black refusing to work with us"".  ""This will now be a long process before our land can be taken. And it can still be stopped,"" Mr Berylson said.  Artist Willow Winston, who will lose her workshop under the current plans, said that while she welcomed the regeneration, the developers ""wish to destroy everything here"".  ""You can't just wash out the history of an area and the people who live in the area"", she said.  Jordana Malik, director at Renewal, called the vote ""an important step forward"" for New Bermondsey which will lead to the creation of 2,000 jobs.  She said the company would ""strive to continue discussions with the remaining land owners,"" including Millwall.  ""Renewal's vision from the outset was to incorporate a successful, self-sustaining football club at the heart of the proposed development,"" she said."
536,"BBC Sport football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a new guest pundit each week this season.  The latest to take centre stage is the actor Gary Oldman. He is starring as the famous spy George Smiley in the new film adaptation of of John Le Carre's novel Lawro's predictions'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'.  Millwall fan Oldman believes Manchester United will continue their blockbusting start to the season by beating Chelsea and backs Tottenham to be in Oscar-winning form against Liverpool, but thinks Manchester City are in line for a Golden Raspberry against Fulham.  A correct result is worth ONE point while a correct score earns THREE points.  Last week, Lawro got two results right and one perfect score, but his five points were beaten by Hard-Fi singer Richard Archer, who scored eight points.  Lawro's best score: seven points (week three).  Lawro's worst score: five points (week one, two and four).  Make your own predictions to see how the Premier League will look after this weekend."
537,"Wigan Athletic reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their 81-year history with a deserved victory over Championship side Millwall at Wembley in a match marred by serious crowd violence.  Shaun Maloney's first-half goal put Roberto Martinez's Premier League side on their way and Callum McManaman secured a meeting with Chelsea or Manchester City next month when he finished off a flowing move 12 minutes from time.  Sadly, however, the occasion was scarred in the closing stages as prolonged fighting broke out in several areas of Millwall's allocated end.  It was an unsavoury conclusion to a game in which the south London side battled gamely but could never match the class of Wigan, who ran out winners with something to spare.  Martinez can now focus his concentration on securing top-flight safety but this was a day of misery for Millwall on the pitch and a shameful one off it as an increasingly tense atmosphere built up throughout the second half before trouble flared.  Many Millwall fans were quick to condemn their own supporters but the fighting took some time to bring under control and is another blot on the club's reputation.  Police using batons moved in to try to stem the violence but some were forced to beat a retreat in clashes with supporters and it took some time to restore a measure of control.  Some fans sustained bloodied facial injuries and one young female supporter was captured on camera in tears as trouble raged around her.  Wigan's supporters, in contrast, were left to celebrate another landmark in the remarkable rise of a club that only joined the Football League in 1978.  This achievement, however, will be overshadowed by what was witnessed in the stands as Millwall's supporters turned on each other once their defeat became a certainty.  For McManaman, though, it was a far happier afternoon.  Less than a month ago he was vilified for his horror challenge on Newcastle United's Massadio Haidara, but against Millwall he caught the eye for all the right reasons.  As expected, given the status of the two clubs, there were vast swathes of empty spaces around Wembley in a crowd of 62,335. It was, however, still a lively atmosphere as the two teams came out.  There had been talk of Wigan chairman Dave Whelan leading the team out but as this was a semi-final and no formal request had been made to the FA, he took his place high in the Wembley stands.  Wigan demonstrated the greater quality in scrappy opening phases and it made the difference when they took the lead. Arouna Kone dropped deep to take the ball on his chest before avoiding the attentions of Millwall's defenders and delivering a perfect cross for Maloney to send a sliding, volleyed finish past David Forde.  The Millwall keeper had distinguished himself with an early save from McManaman and showed great athleticism to turn away an effort from Jordi Gomez following more good work by the dangerous Kone.  The skilful McManaman and Maloney had been posing problems for the Lions and so it proved again in the moments after the restart. McManaman slalomed his way in from the left flank, beating Millwall defenders, but his attempted finish from an acute angle was over-ambitious and flew off target.  Martinez made his first change on the hour as Jean Beausejour was replaced by James McArthur as Millwall finally started to make some headway via set pieces and the aerial power of captain Danny Shittu.  The shift in emphasis prompted Jackett to make a change of his own after 67 minutes, sending on experienced striker Rob Hulse for Jack Smith.  The Latics always held the upper hand and their return to Wembley was confirmed when Kone broke out of defence and Gomez played in McManaman, who rounded Forde to score.

538,"For Steve Norris, who ran Ken Livingstone a far closer race than expected, it had been the case of third time lucky.  His route to become the Tory candidate for London mayor became as dogged as anything Mr Livingstone had to face, although at the end of the day, Norris was at least able to say he had been elected on a one member, one vote basis.  Late last year Norris was beaten to become the Conservatives' mayoral candidate by the millionaire author Lord Archer.  But when Archer was forced to resign after the tabloid revelation that he had asked a friend to lie for him prior to a libel case, Norris was given another chance to become the Tory candidate.  Many assumed the nomination would automatically go to Norris, whose previous role as minister for transport in London appeared to make him an obvious choice.  Instead the party decided to restage the contest and Norris had to reapply, only to be almost blocked from the party's shortlist over concerns surrounding his colourful private life.  Conservative chairman Michael Ancram had to wade into the row and reinstate Norris, overriding the original decision by the party's mayoral executive to block him.  But the incident unearthed a groundswell of support for Norris, who finally became the party's candidate in January.  Like Frank Dobson, Norris is not a Londoner by birth, though he has adopted the city as his home.  He was born in Liverpool in 1945, educated at the same grammar school as Paul McCartney and George Harrison and then at Oxford.  Instead of following a career in the law, which he studied, he went into the motor trade and became a franchise-holder for Volkswagen and Audi in the 70s and 80s.  Norris had been in the Labour club at Oxford but it was as a Tory councillor that he entered politics when he was elected on to Berkshire County Council in 1977.  Five years later, he was selected from 200 applicants to stand for the Oxford East seat which he won in 1983 and held until 1987 when he became the only Tory to lose his seat in the south of England, to the current chief secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Smith.  Norris was considered for numerous by-elections the following year, including the Richmond contest which elected William Hague, and eventually won the seat of Epping Forest.  During his time in Parliament, he served as the parliamentary private secretary to three ministers before being appointed as a junior minister for transport in London in 1992.  He was then promoted in 1994 to minister for local transport and road safety but stood down at the 1997 general election in preference of earning some ""serious money"" and became director general of the Road Haulage Association.  It was a position which maintained him in the spotlight until he stood down to concentrate on the mayoral battle, although he does remain a director of a number of transport-related companies.  Norris is as candid about the reasons he left Parliament as he is about how he lost his cash made from his dealerships during the recession a decade ago.  Similarly, he is also open about the relationships with five ""mistresses"" exposed by the tabloids during the ""back to basics"" era which earned him the nickname of ""Shagger"", although he insisted the affairs stretched over 25 years.  He has two sons by his first wife Vicky, whom he married in 1969, and another son with his current wife, Emma, whom he married last month.  Norris lives in Clapham, south London, and despite his Liverpool roots, is someone who has chosen London as his adopted city - illustrated by the fact that though an Everton fan by birth, he is now a Fulham season ticket holder.  As an MP, he supported the death penalty, football identity cards, the Poll Tax, student loans and has described commuters as ""dreadful human beings"".  But his mayoral battle was fought on a more liberal social agenda.  Labelled the Tory candidate that ""dare not speak"" the party's name by his opponents, Norris stood for the repeal of Section 28 and a London which reflected and catered for its ethnic minority population.  He also called for the consideration of cannabis to be used in the treatment of medical complaints and called for police to overlook the law against ""'discreet public sex"" between homosexuals.  Many have enjoyed the return of one of the Tories' most affable warhorses back to the spotlight and despite being unable to become London's first directly elected mayor, it is unlikely Norris will remain out of the public eye for very long."
539,"The Daily Telegraph has obtained details of MPs' expenses claims over the past four years which it has published.  Here is a summary of the claims made by some Labour politicians and their reaction to the reports.  Claim: The Sunday Telegraph said Mr Kemp, the MP for Houghton and Washington East, claimed for two DVD players for his one-bedroom flat in the space of a month. He was also reimbursed for the cost of 16 bed sheets and claimed for two flat-screen televisions a year apart, it was reported. In the case of one of them, the Fees Office refused to pay the full £1,699 he asked for on the basis that the maximum claim was £750, it was suggested. The former Labour whip was also said to have bought goods including a freezer and fridge near his north-east England constituency, despite the London flat being designated his second home. He also charged the taxpayer £105.75 for an engineer to attend to his washing machine when he could not work out how to operate it, the Sunday Telegraph claimed.  Response: Mr Kemp told the Sunday Telegraph the claims for bed linen and a second DVD player were ""an error for which I apologise"" and that he would pay back the cash. He said he bought the second TV and fridge before moving in to a new flat. He said there had been a problem with his washing machine but that he would be happy to reimburse the sum claimed. On suggestions he had profited from the sale of his second home by claiming £1,532 to cover legal fees, he said: ""I'll seek advice from HMRC to ensure appropriate liabilities have been met.""  Claim: The Tyne Bridge MP was said to have ""bought out"" his partner's share of a joint mortgage on a flat in London, costing the taxpayer thousands of pounds plus legal fees. The Telegraph said that after the deal, which was approved by the Commons Fees Office, the mortgage interest payments increased by £200 per month.  Response: Mr Clelland insisted it would have cost the taxpayer more had he rented a flat. He said his partner had initially viewed the property as an investment but that she legitimately decided to withdraw her money in 2004, when it was rumoured that MPs might be ordered to hand over any profits made from such properties to the taxpayer. He told the BBC the London flat was ""not a home, it's the flat I live in... [it] is what I have to have to do my work as a member of parliament and that's why the costs fall on the taxpayer.""  Claim: The Telegraph said the Bury North MP claimed nearly £13,000 for a mortgage he had already cleared. The paper says that between September 2005 and August 2006, the Labour backbencher claimed £1,175 a month in interest on his Westminster flat. However, Land Registry records show the mortgage was paid off in January 2004. The Telegraph also alleged that Mr Chaytor ""flipped"" the designation of his second home six times, including once to a house registered in his son's name. He reportedly blamed these actions on ""changing and complex family circumstances"".  Response: In a statement, Mr Chaytor told the Telegraph he apologised ""unreservedly"" for what had been ""an unforgivable error in accounting procedures"". He reportedly told the paper he would arrange repayment to the Commons fees office immediately. Mr Chaytor has referred himself to the parliamentary standards watchdog and has also been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the outcome of investigations. He has decided to stand down as an MP at the next election.  Claim: The Telegraph said the former environment minister claimed £16,000 in mortgage interest payments on his home in his Scunthorpe constituency even though the mortgage had ended 18 months before. Although records show his mortgage had been repaid by March 2006, Mr Morley continued to be reimbursed for £800 a month in 2006-7. The Telegraph claims the anomaly was not spotted earlier as Mr Morley re-designated his London home as his second residence - a move known as ""flipping"" - in November 2007. It says Mr Morley had been renting out his London flat to another Labour MP, Ian Cawsey who nominated it as his second home and claimed back the £1,000 a month rent he paid to Mr Morley. This arrangement ended in March 2008 after the Commons Fees office became aware of the situation.  Response: Mr Morley admits the error was entirely his fault and has apologised ""unreservedly"" for it. He says he repaid all of the money once he had discovered his mistake. He has referred the matter of his expenses to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner for further scrutiny. However, Gordon Brown has acted by suspending Mr Morley as a member of the Parliamentary Labour Party and also suspending the whip from him in Parliament. Mr Morley has also been suspended from his role as Gordon Brown's climate change envoy. He has also said he will stand down as an MP. Mr Cawsey told the Daily Telegraph he had been unaware of Mr Morley's financial arrangements.  Claim: The Telegraph says the Dewsbury MP claimed £66,827 from the second home allowance - the maximum allowed - over three years towards the cost of his London flat - bought in 2001 before he was elected. According to the paper, Mr Malik's claims over the period included £2,100 for a flat screen television, £1,420 for a bathroom, £671 for a fireplace and £730 for a massage chair. It says the Fees Office rejected the TV claim - ultimately granting the MP £1,050 for a TV and £250 for a DVD system - and a further claim for an iPod. Mr Malik is also reported to have claimed for a £65 court summons for not paying council tax. While claiming the equivalent of £443 per week for his London flat, the Telegraph says Mr Malik was paying less than £100 a week to rent a property in his constituency from a local businessman. It says the rental agreement with the businessman, from whom it says the MP also rented a constituency office - began in 2004 and continued until 2008 when Mr Malik married and moved into a larger property in the town.  Response: The justice minister defended his claims as being totally within the rules but did temporarily step down from his post pending an inquiry into whether he had received a preferential rent on his Dewsbury property and if so, whether that breached the ministerial code. He emphatically rejects claims he was paying a peppercorn rent for his Dewsbury property, saying this was a fabrication. Mr Malik has repaid the £65 claim for council tax summons and has said he will make a £1050 donation - relating to the value of the TV - to good causes in his constituency as a ""gesture"". He said he would not give the money back to the fees office because they had approved all his expenditure in the first place. He said he had claimed for ""basic essentials"" under the second home allowance such as mortgage interest, utility bills and council tax and had behaved ""one million per cent by the book"". As for furnishings, he said he did not receive a ""good service"" from the Commons Fees Office which didn't tell him there was an upper limit on individual claimable items. He says the Green Book which governs what MPs can claim was full of ""subjective rules"" and the system was now ""in tatters"". He said he had never ""flipped"" his home arrangements and always spent most of his time in Dewsbury. He said the Telegraph had picked him out - rather than David Cameron, who he said had claimed as much as him - because it was a Conservative-supporting newspaper. Mr Malik was investigated by No 10's adviser on ministerial interests, who, No 10 said, cleared him of receiving a preferential rent or breaching the ministerial code. After that verdict he was appointed as communities minister.  Claim: The prime minister paid his brother, Andrew, £6,577 for arranging cleaning services for his Westminster flat for 26 months.  Since reporting the arrangement, the Telegraph group has clarified that there ""has never been any suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the Prime Minister or his brother"".  Response: No 10 said the two shared a cleaner who worked in both their flats. Andrew Brown paid her and was reimbursed for his share of the cost. He did not do the cleaning himself or gain financially.  There was a formal contract for the arrangement, Downing Street sources add, stipulating the cleaner's hours of work and pay. The cleaner wanted to be paid by one person for National Insurance purposes.  Claim: Gordon Brown also claimed twice for the same plumbing work within six months of each other.  Response: The House of Commons Fees Office said the mistake had been inadvertent and apologised for having not spotted it. Gordon Brown is understood to have repaid the sum involved - believed to be £150.  Claim: The justice secretary over-claimed £1,500 on council tax on his second home.  He made a claim for the full bill despite getting a 50% discount from the local authority for the property.  Response: A spokesman for Mr Straw said he acted within the rules. He spotted the mistaken council tax claim himself and repaid the money himself. Mr Straw later told the BBC: ""I have acted in complete good faith and within the rules. It is an error, which obviously I wish hadn't happened, but in circumstances in which I was incredibly busy during that period - that is not an excuse, it is just an explanation.""  Claim: The culture secretary was reportedly battling with the fees office for eight months over a £16,500 expenses claim to buy and renovate a new London flat which was eventually paid, after being rejected three times.  He also claimed a £19.99 bath robe bought from Ikea in 2007 that was not allowed.  Response: Mr Burnham insists he did not profit from the property transaction. He made only permissible claims and returned a £1,000 surplus to the Fees Office for allowances he did not spend.  On the Ikea receipt, he made a ""genuine oversight"" on one item. When it was discovered, he corrected it and he was not reimbursed.  Claim: The business secretary claimed for improvements on his constituency home after he announced he was leaving Parliament to become an EU Commissioner.  He later sold the property for a profit of £136,000.  Response: Lord Mandelson rejected claims he used taxpayers' cash to ""renovate"" his home for profit, insisting the money was spent on essential maintenance. He said the Telegraph's report - which details a £1,500 gardening bill and £1,350 in house repairs - was presented to provoke public anger. ""The fact is that these allowances would not have been paid if they weren't within the rules,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland.  Claim: Veteran Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman is alleged to have claimed £1,851 for a rug imported from a New York antique centre and tried to claim more than £8,000 for a television. The Telegraph also said he entered a claim for £28,834 - more than £15,000 of which was paid - for improvements to his London home, after telling officials he was ""living in a slum"".  Response: Mr Kaufman refused to comment publicly on the allegations when confronted by reporters in his Manchester Gorton constituency. Earlier, he reportedly told the Telegraph he had offered to repay the money for the rug and called the television claim ""a bit daft"".     Claim: The Welsh Secretary claimed for a new boiler after saying his existing hot water system was ""too hot"".  Response: His old boiler was replaced after it was deemed unsafe and could not be repaired. All his claims were within the rules and ""assiduously"" checked by the authorities.  Claim: The former deputy prime minister claimed £312 for the fitting of mock Tudor beams to the front of his constituency home in Hull and in December 2004 a plumber charged him £210.79 for pipework, taps and to ""refix WC seat,"" according to the newspaper. In September 2006, he put a £112.52 repair bill on expenses, which included ""refit WC seat"".  Response: Mr Prescott said: ""Every expense was within the rules of the House of Commons on claiming expenses at the time.""  Claim: Taxpayers contributed almost £100,000 to help pay the mortgage on a £1.35m flat owned by the Northern Ireland secretary, it is reported.  The money went on mortgage interest payments and council tax between 2004 and 2008 for the flat. Married to a member of the Sainsbury family and worth an estimated £15m - Mr Woodward is the richest member of the cabinet, though he does not draw a full ministerial salary.  Response: The Northern Ireland secretary's spokesman has said the claims are within the rules and guidelines but Mr Woodward admitted politicians collectively looked ""shameful"". He said: ""If I try to make almost any defence of our collective position - or my position - it looks terrible."" However, he added that politicians of all parties ""are good people who try by and large to do a good job"" within a ""rotten"" system.  Claim: The Telegraph claims the Europe minister put solicitors' fees and stamp duty totalling £14,553 on her Parliamentary expenses after buying a central London flat.  Before moving in to her second home in Victoria, she also claimed the £177 a month cost of putting her furniture in storage. Over a period of about eight months in 2005 to 2006, Ms Flint claimed for staying in hotels for an average of three nights a week.  Response: Ms Flint told the Telegraph she had sought advice from Commons officials at each stage and ""never sought to make personal gains from public funds"". She said only about half the cost of her London flat - including stamp duty - was met through public funds as she had contributed a ""substantial amount"" towards the cost of buying it from the proceeds of a previous flat sale.  Claim: The MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East claimed £2,800 for a settee and £2,000 for a carpet to furnish his second home. The Telegraph also accused Mr Goggins, who is Northern Ireland minister, of ""flipping"" his two houses in London and Manchester to make a profit. The paper also reports he allowed a university friend to live rent-free in a home paid for by the taxpayer.  Response: Mr Goggins defended his household purchases by saying he liked to ""live by decent standards"". ""I do not lead an extravagant lifestyle, people should remember that we have to furnish our first home with our own money,"" he said.  Mr Goggins denied flipping his houses and said he was told to change the designation of his second home when he became a minister: ""To try and suggest that I did it to make money is absolute nonsense, it was compulsory.""  On allowing university friend Chris Bain to live rent-free, he said the arrangements were based on a ""30-year friendship"" and due to the fact that Mr Bain had been the joint owner of the property for six years between 1997 and 2003.  Claim: Mrs Beckett found herself in trouble with the Fees Office after attempting to claim £600 for hanging baskets and pot plants.  An official informed her in a letter that expenses had to be ""wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred to enable you to stay overnight away from your main home"". She claimed second home allowances of £72,537 from 2004 to 2008, despite having no mortgage or rent to pay on her constituency home in Derby. As environment secretary and foreign secretary, Mrs Beckett was living at the grace and favour Admiralty House in Whitehall, which enabled her to rent out her London flat.  Response: The former foreign secretary said: ""Grace and favour homes are not rent free, we are taxed on them as a benefit in kind.""  Claim: The Chief Whip claimed £18,000 in expenses without receipts for food over four years. He also claimed £250 a month for a cleaner, £200 a month for ""service and maintenance"", and £200 a month for ""repairs"" - all without receipts. Mr Brown - who has been put in charge of investigating claims involving Labour MPs - also claimed £87,708 for his constituency home between 2004 and 2008. In 2007/8 his mortgage interest repayments were £6,600. But he claimed £23,068 - just £15 below the maximum permitted - by including £4,800 for food, £2,880 for services, £2,880 for ""repairs and insurance"", £1,810 for utilities, £1,640 for phones and £897.65 for cleaning.  Response: Mr Brown, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend, told his local newspaper, The Journal, that his claims were ""not unreasonable"" and were all for genuine expenses. He added: ""I am working flat out for the people that I represent and the politics that I believe in.""  Claim: The tourism minister claimed £25,411.64 for security patrols at her London home after she was mugged.  She also requested £528.75 to have a Chinese needlepoint rug repaired and cleaned but that was deemed excessive by the Fees Office and she was handed back just £300.  Response: Mrs Follett told the BBC: ""I claimed it, it's within the rules and I have no comment to make."" She had earlier told the Telegraph that only two of the claims she had submitted during the last 12 years had been disputed and that the one item not accepted had been claimed in error.  Claim: The Telegraph suggested the immigration minister had claimed for nappies and women's clothing when submitting requests for expenses.  It said it was unclear how these items had been justified because parliamentary rules only allowed payouts for items which were ""exclusively"" for MPs' own use.  Response: Mr Woolas has threatened legal action over the ""disgusting"" allegations. He said the items had been on supermarket receipts submitted as part of a claim for food expenses but that he had never asked for money for them. Mr Woolas described the expenses records as ""stolen property"".  Claim: In response to Mr Woolas' complaints, the Sunday Telegraph claimed that in August 2004 he had submitted five receipts totalling £210.31 for food and was reimbursed in full. However, the paper points out that the receipts included non-permissible items such as disposable bibs, nail polish, comics and a ladies' jumper.  Response: Mr Woolas told the newspaper he understood the extrapolation but insisted he had done nothing wrong. He has pointed out that - under rules at the time - he was not obliged to submit receipts for food totalling up to £400. He has also pointed out that he did not claim for women's clothing, as the newspaper claims. He said he had actually submitted six receipts totalling £245.98, meaning he did not receive taxpayers' money for some items. ""I am being hung out to dry for being honest,"" he said.  Claim: Care Services Minister Phil Hope was said to have spent more than £37,000 over about four years on refurbishing and furnishing a two-bedroom south London flat.  Response: Mr Hope has said his claims for running and furnishing the flat were ""in full accordance with the rules"" and that the purchases were ""no more than was necessary to live in a habitable residence"". However, he has decided to pay back £41,709 of the money in light of the public anger about the expenses system. He said negative coverage about his claims had been a ""massive blow"" to him and his family and reduced the standing in which he was held by his constituents.  Claim: The Labour whip offered to ""dig out"" other receipts after she over-claimed rent on her constituency home by £2,600 - an offer which was accepted by the Commons fees office. After the Brent South MP bought a home in Wembley, she claimed £2,650 for a central heating system and installed a whirlpool bath in a suite costing £2,308 - even though her main home was just 15 miles away in east London. Though just £800 was claimed for the bathroom, the parliamentary green book says payments should not be made for ""capital costs of repairs which go beyond making good dilapidations and enhance the property"".  Response: Ms Butler denied the claim about the whirlpool bath and said she was taking legal advice. ""There is nothing underhand here in any of my claims. All the claims are for legitimate expenditure,"" she added.  Claim: The chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee claimed more than £75,000 to fund a second home in Westminster, even though his family home is just 12 miles away in Stanmore.  The Telegraph also suggested he changed his designated second home for a single year to property in his Leicester constituency, before claiming more than £4,000 on furnishings.  Response: Mr Vaz told the BBC he lived in Leicester and that his second home was in Westminster. He has had a Westminster flat since becoming an MP in 1987. He made no claim for the Stanmore home, which he acquired on getting married and was - he pointed out - not in central London. ""It's on junction 4 of the M1 and I keep the Westminster flat for early morning meetings as do many MPs who live in that block,"" he said.  Claim: A health minister, the Telegraph claimed he had switched his second home designation to a more expensive jointly-owned London property and claimed full mortgage interest payments, in order for his partner to ""benefit from the system"".  The couple had previously split the mortgage costs, the paper said. However, it claimed that Mr Bradshaw was now submitting the entire cost of interest on the property to be paid out of expenses.  Response: Exeter MP Mr Bradshaw told the BBC he had always claimed for their London home and only briefly switched to claiming for his constituency property between 2003 and 2006, because of a temporary rule telling ministers to claim constituency rather than London costs. The minister said before he and his partner entered into a civil partnership in 2006 he had claimed only a proportion of the mortgage interest - even though he would have been entitled to claim it all. Since then, he had claimed for and paid the full mortgage interest on their London property, as the rules allowed, he said. He added that he always submitted comparatively low claims and had long called for reform of the expenses system.  Claim: According to the Telegraph, the Labour MP for Luton South spent £22,500 treating dry rot at the coastal property in Southampton she had designated as her second home - even though it was a two-hour drive from Parliament and 100 miles from her constituency.  Response: Ms Moran has now said she will pay back the money claimed for her Southampton home. She said it was claimed in full consultation with staff at the Commons fees office and said she had stuck to the rules. But she added: ""However, I do understand constituents' anger at the current fees regime, which is why I will be repaying the full amount claimed for my home in Southampton."" Explaining her claim days earlier she said her partner had worked in Southampton for 20 years and that she could not ""make him come to Luton all the time"". She said: ""I have to have a proper family life and I can't do that unless I share the costs of the Southampton home with him."" Ms Moran also said there had been some ""inaccuracies"" which were ""probably actionable"" in the Telegraph reports.  Claim: Within a year of being elected in 2005, Ms Ussher is said to have set out to the Commons authorities over two pages a list of ""essential repairs"" to her Victorian house in south London.  It detailed how the house ""was relatively cheap to purchase but requires quite a lot of work"". Among the work listed was replacing ""rotten"" sash windows and a ""grimy"" stair carpet. She received the full £22,110 allowance, although her requests to replace ""strange"" plumbing and ""bad taste"" Artex were refused. The Sunday Telegraph claimed she had already lived in the house for five years.  Response: The work and pensions minister's spokesman said Ms Ussher ""fully supports"" the review into MPs' expenses claims and believed it was right that MPs expenses' claims should be published. ""All her claims were in line with the relevant House of Commons rules and guidance and have been approved by the Fees Office,"" he said.  Claim: Former long-serving Labour MP Tam Dalyell attempted to claim £18,000 for bookcases, two months before retiring from Parliament in 2005, the Telegraph alleged.  Response: Mr Dalyell, formerly MP for Linlithgow, said he was ""absolutely unrepentant"" about the claim. He told the BBC he had bought the bookcases to store documents gathered during his political career and had approached the Fees Office to ask what proportion of the £18,000 he could claim back in expenses. He said the office eventually paid about £7,800. He said he believed it was ""a legitimate office expense"" and would ""definitely not"" pay the money back.  Claim: It is claimed the junior minister had a £450 widescreen television delivered to his family home in Wales and then claimed it on his allowance for his second home in London.  Response: Mr Brennan, Parliamentary Under Secretary in the Cabinet Office, said the Telegraph story was ""a thinly-disguised smear which has absolutely no basis in fact"". He said all items claimed for which were purchased in or delivered to his Cardiff home were for exclusive use in the London property, and after the larger items were stored in his garage they were taken east by a local business. Mr Brennan insisted that he had always stuck to the rules, but said the system needed to be ""urgently reformed"".  Claim: The MP for Brent North made a profit of almost £200,000 from a flat mortgaged and renovated with the help of taxpayers' cash, the Telegraph has alleged. He is yet to respond.  Claim: The Telegraph accused the MP for Rhondda of ""flipping"" his second home twice in two years, allowing him to claim almost £20,000 in expenses.  Response: Mr Bryant, who is deputy leader of the House of Commons, described the allegations as ""unfounded and inaccurate"". The openly-gay MP said he moved to a more secure property after ""a series of attacks on my home"" and had asked the Fees Office what work on the new house he could claim back.  Claim: The Solicitor General - one of the government's top legal advisers - was refused a £268 claim for Christmas decorations.  Response: Ms Baird insists she has broken no rules.  Claim: The former Trade Secretary used the expenses system to claim more than £125,000 for the London flat owned by his partner, it is claimed.  Over the past five years, Mr Byers is said to have spent more than £27,000 on renovation, redecoration, maintenance and appliances at his flat in Camden, north London.  Response: Mr Byers told the Sunday Telegraph all his claims were within the rules and had been approved by Commons authorities.  Claim: The Telegraph has suggested the former Home Secretary claimed for a £199 pouffe, a £370 armchair and an £899 sofa.  He is also said to have submitted receipts for £486.50 spent at Marks and Spencer last August on items including slotted spoons, three rattan bins, oven mitts, wineglasses and ice cube trays. His expenses claim for 2007-08 also included a letter from the TV Licensing authority warning the occupier of the property ""there is no valid television licence"". Mr Reid's office pointed out that the TV licensing letter was addressed to the previous occupier of the property.  Claim: The former Prime Minister used his parliamentary expenses to remortgage his constituency home for £296,000 - nearly 10 times what he paid for it - just months before buying a west London house for £3.65m.  According to the Sunday Telegraph, the loan would have been enough to cover the cost of the deposit on the new home. It said he was able to claim for interest repayments on almost a third of the new mortgage on his constituency home.  Response: His spokesman told the newspaper Mr Blair only claimed back the interest repayments on the portion of the mortgage which covered the purchase price and improvements to the house. There was no cost to the taxpayer in the rest of the money raised against the property, he added.  Claim: The government whip claimed up to £1,150 in ""petty cash"" over eight months on her second home allowance. When told by the fees office in 2004 that cash payments were not permitted, she stopped claiming but did not return the money. Ms Ward, MP for Watford, switched her second home to a flat just a few minutes walk from her old property and more than doubled her mortgage interest payments.  Response: Ms Ward told the Telegraph that the claims for ""petty cash"" were clarified as ""miscellaneous household items"". She denied ""flipping"" her second home for financial gain, saying that she had sold a one-bedroom flat and bought a two-bedroom flat in anticipation of her new family. As she had an offset mortgage, she said, her housing costs had ""fluctuated"".  Claim: Edinburgh North and Leith MP Mark Lazarowicz claimed more than £5,000 in costs for legal and professional fees incurred in extending the lease of his London flat.  Response: Mr Lazarowicz has decided to repay about £2,675 of those costs.  While the claims had been approved by the Fees Office, he said he had only realised the scale of the legal costs associated with the extension - which led to a lengthy dispute - in recent days.  He said the amount was ""much higher"" than many of the public would be prepared to accept and that it was right that he repaid a ""substantial"" share of it.  Claim: The Telegraph says Labour MPs Alan and Ann Keen - who are married - have claimed £137,679 between them towards a central London flat despite the fact their family home is less than ten miles away. According to the paper, the couple bought the London property in 2002 and have, between them, claimed more than £30,000 towards it in each of the past four years. The couple's main home is in Brentford. Alan Keen is MP for Feltham and Heston while Ann Keen - a junior health minister - is MP for neighbouring Brentford and Isleworth. The paper said the couple claimed for interest payments on a £520,000 mortgage for the London flat even though the actual purchase price of the property was £500,000. It also claims the Fees Office had reduced their awards in 2007 because both MPs had claimed for council tax on the London property. Among the couple's claims on the London property, the paper adds, were a £50 call-out fee for fixing the sound on a home cinema system.  Response: The couple say that, under the second home allowance rules, married MPs are entitled to separately claim for a property that they share and live in together. Alan Keen said the Commons authorities had agreed to the mortgage repayment claims after the couple explained to them that their bank had asked for the loan to be secured against both properties for added security. He said the authorities had agreed that the value of the London flat was £520,000, the couple having bought it for £500,000 and agreed to pay the seller an additional £20,000 for fixtures and fittings.  Claim: The government whip attempted to spread his claim for stamp duty on his second home in London across two financial years. Mr Austin, MP for Dudley North, divided the stamp duty on the purchase of the London flat in March 2006 into two claims - £6,770 on 28 March and £1,344 on 3 April. As a result, he was able to claim nearly all his second home allowance for the financial year 2005/6. Although the £1,344 claim was rejected by the fees office, Mr Austin was repaid for the move's legal costs in 2006-7. He was also alleged to have ""flipped"" his second home weeks before purchasing the flat.  Response: Mr Austin told the Daily Telegraph that an error in calculating the costs of the move resulted in the stamp duty claim being refused. He said the fees office had advised him to split the costs over two financial years. Mr Austin added that he apologised for the miscalculation and no payments were received or made as a result of the error.  Claim: Labour's former chief whip claimed £3,100 towards the cost of treating the gables and walls of her constituency home.  Response: The MP for Durham North West says the gables needed correcting because of a problem of ""hornets getting into the cavity wall"". The work was ""essential"" to maintaining the basic infrastructure of the house, she added.  Claim: The Labour whip and MP for Birmingham Hall Green over-claimed £4,059 on his mortgage over two years.  Response: Mr McCabe told the BBC he disputes the sum. He said he ""did make an error"", as he told the Telegraph. But once the Fees Office notified him of this, he sorted it out by offsetting against subsequent claims.  Claim: The Wirral South MP claimed for interest payments on his mortgage that he had already paid off, the Telegraph reports.  Having repaid £295,000 of the loan in 2002, Mr Chapman continued to receive £15,000 over 10 months for the interest part of the mortgage which he no longer paid. According to the Telegraph, this situation was not unique to Mr Chapman.  Response: Mr Chapman says the Fees Office has informed him that the advice he was given in 2002 about what he could claim back on his mortgage was incorrect and he was effectively ""misled"". He regrets the error was not spotted earlier but that it was dealt with in 2003 when it emerged. He says he never intended to receive money he was not entitled to and stresses there is no evidence that this ever happened. He says he has done nothing wrong. However, he has decided to stand down at the next election because of the damage that the allegations have done to him, his family and his constituents.  Claim: The former Labour party chairman claimed £16,000 on furniture and decorating his second home but repaid it all last year after the rules on what MPs could claim for were tightened up.  Response: ""I personally decided to ask for an audit of my old accounts based on the new system.  ""All the amounts that I have claimed were with the rules and appropriate and had been approved. Despite the terrible flaws in the system I have done everything humanly possible to do the right thing.""  The MP has since announced he will be standing down at the next election for health reasons.  The Bridgend MP submitted receipts for more than £4,000 on furniture for her designated second home, in London, that was delivered to her constituency home in Wales.  Response: ""The Welsh shop in Wales even when it is for installation in London by a London contractor.""  Claim: Ms Johnson, a government whip and MP for Hull North, claimed nearly £1,000 for hiring an architect for a decorating project at her second home.  Response: Her spokesman said her home was in a conservation area and had required planning permission to replace the windows. The work was carried out after it had been found that the windows were rotten. All of the expenditure had been approved. However, Miss Johnson repaid the money around two months ago.  The MP for East Leeds claimed £62,000 in expenses over four years for his London flat while having a mortgage of £26,000. The fees office questioned him over buying furniture in Leeds despite having assigned his London flat as his second home.  Response: The Labour backbencher said that although bought in Leeds, the items were for his flat in London. He added: ""The goods were purchased in Leeds mainly because I prefer shopping with my wife. They were transported to London when convenient, either by car (the smaller items) or by van.""  Claim: The paper says Mr Davidson claimed nearly £1,500 for reclining furniture for his London flat although it was delivered to his main home in Glasgow. It reports that the MP paid a property search firm nearly £6,000 to help him find a flat, a proportion of which was reimbursed from public funds. It also says he paid a ""family friend"" £5,500 to renovate his second home.  Response: The MP for Glasgow South West, a member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, says he employed a professional property firm after spending ""many fruitless hours"" looking for a flat in London. He said the Fees Office agreed the cost of this was ""acceptable"". The Commons authorities gave him permission to employ a Glaswegian firm to do essential work on his flat rather than a London-based one as it was cheaper, he added. The furniture was initially sent to Glasgow as his constituency home was always occupied while access to his London flat for deliveries was limited as it fronted onto a bus lane and had restricted parking. It was later delivered to London.  Claim: The Daily Telegraph alleged that the former cabinet minister claimed £31,000 of taxpayers' money for flood damage to her second home, even though she had a building insurance policy at the time.  Ms Kelly also tried to claim £3,600 for a sofa and chairs, £2,355 for a dining table and chairs, and £2,000 for a plasma screen television but they were reduced by the fees office for being excessive.  Response: Ms Kelly insisted that she made an entirely legitimate claim after flooding at her constituency home. She told the BBC that ""my claim was neither ludicrous claim nor a phantom claim"", unlike others featured in the Telegraph. She argued that the furniture which she claimed to replace was ""worthless"" since it was 30 years old having been inherited from her parents - and so could not have been claimed on insurance. She says that the rebuilding work was handled in her absence whilst she was juggling being a minister and the mother of four young children. She concedes that she did not explore whether she could have claimed on her building insurance.  Claim: The North East Derbyshire MP spent £1,800 on a television, £2,900 on a sofa and £1,950 on a bed within months of being elected. She also claimed a total of £90 for 12 wine glasses and six champagne flutes. She says she told the fees office she did not want to claim the full amount for the household goods as she was aware that they were luxury items, before submitting her receipts. She received £750 each for the television and the bed plus £2,000 for the sofa.  Response: Ms Engel said she had put her expenses with explanatory notes on her website.  Claim: The junior education minister submitted a receipt for a £100 pair of hair straighteners. But she was told she would not be reimbursed because the fees office was ""unable to allow costs relating to personal items, in this case hair stylers"".  Response: Ms McCarthy-Fry, who is also MP for Portsmouth North, told the Daily Telegraph: ""I fully accept this was a personal item that was claimed in error and was correctly rejected by the fees office.""  Claim: The Daily Telegraph said Dr Gibson claimed for a flat which his daughter and her partner lived in rent-free. It also claimed the Norwich North MP then sold it to them for less than he paid and well below market value.  Response: Dr Gibson has insisted he acted within the rules and ""made nothing on the house whatsoever"". But he said he could understand why members of the public might think his arrangements were ""unfair"" and offered to stand down as an MP if his constituents wanted.  Claim: The chancellor claimed £10,000 towards the cost of furnishing the London flat he bought in 2005, according to The Telegraph.  Mr Darling bought the £226,000 property near the Oval cricket ground, claiming £2,074 for furniture and £2,339 for carpets. There was also a £765 claim from Ikea and £768 from Marks and Spencer's for a bed. The £146 cost of staying in a hotel while his flat was being renovated in September 2005 was rejected by the fees office on the grounds that the property was counted as his second home.  But Mr Darling successfully argued that he was ""between second homes"" and the bill was later paid. He also used his expenses to cover the stamp duty of £2,260 and legal fees totalling £1,238.  It was also reported that Mr Darling ""switched"" the location of his second home four times in four years, allowing him to claim thousands of pounds towards the cost of both his Edinburgh home and for the London flat.  In further disclosures about MPs, Mr Darling was said to have spent £1,400 for help filling in his tax return over two years.  According to more of the Telegraph's revelations, in July 2007, having just become chancellor, Mr Darling claimed £1,000 for the service charge at his south London flat.  This charge covered the six months to the end of year, during which time he had begun to claim second home allowances on his grace-and-favour home in Downing Street, and rent out the other flat.  Response: Mr Darling said: ""The claims were made within House of Commons rules which were designed to reflect the fact that MPs have to meet the cost of living in two places.""  He added that he had employed an accountant ""to ensure that the correct amount of tax was paid in respect of my office costs"".  On the service charge bill, Mr Darling's spokesman initially insisted that the report was wrong. However the chancellor has now said that he will repay £700 of the bill to cover the period when he was not living there.  ""When I reclaimed the cost of the service charge in July I was living in the flat. However, because the service charge covered the period beyond September until December I will repay the service charge from September to December.""  Claim: The communities secretary claimed for three different properties in a single year, spending almost £5,000 of taxpayers' money on furniture in three months, the Telegraph reports.  She also claimed for stays at London hotels after selling her flat. In March 2004, she declared her property in her Salford constituency was her second home and spent £850 on a television and video and £651 on a mattress. In April, she switched her second home to a flat in south London, claiming £850 a month for the mortgage.  In August, she sold the flat, making a £45,000 profit, and stayed in hotels over the following two months. In December, she bought another London flat for £300,000, claiming a monthly mortgage of £1,000 and a grocery bill of £400.  It was also reported that she claimed for accountancy services and a £219 digital camera.  Response: Ms Blears has admitted she did not pay capital gains tax (CGT) on the £45,000 profit from the flat sale and has agreed to repay £13,332. CGT is charged at 40% on the sale of homes the Inland Revenue does not consider to be a main residence. At the time, it was registered as her second home for expenses purposes. Ms Blears said she had complied with both Commons and Revenue and Customs rules but had agreed to repay the tax anyway. Ms Blears said her outlay on furnishings - such as mattresses and pillows - was ""reasonable"". She added that her use of an accountancy firm was in line with Commons rules.  Claim: The Daily Telegraph said the Transport Secretary did not pay capital gains tax on the sale of his London home in 2006. Previously, it had reported that Mr Hoon switched his ""second home"" designation - refurbishing his family home in Derbyshire at taxpayers' expense before buying a London townhouse.  At the time he was defence secretary and later Commons leader and had a ""grace and favour"" Whitehall apartment. After losing that apartment in 2006, the newspaper says he bought a Georgian townhouse in Westminster and declared that as his second home. He went on to claim £21,995 in 2006/07 and £23,083 in 2007/8 - the maximum allowed. His monthly mortgage interest payments, picked up by the taxpayer, increased from £270 to almost £900.  The newspapers also said that his claims for accountancy services reached almost £3,000 over two years, and that he put a £200 digital camera on office expenses.  Response: Mr Hoon said he rejected ""any suggestion of any wrongdoing"" and said he had been ""assiduous"" in reporting his tax obligations. He said the Inland Revenue and a firm of chartered accountants he had consulted had both agreed there was no need to pay capital gains tax. A spokeswoman said he did not intend to repay any money and Downing Street has said it believes he complied with the letter and the spirit of the law.  In response to the earlier claims, Mr Hoon said he still had ""significant costs"" to meet at his grace and favour flat at Admiralty House - although it was rent free. ""These were comparable to the costs I would have incurred if I had continued to live in my own property, therefore a claim under the ACA for my constituency home was not unreasonable,"" he said. He said officials told him it was within the rules and similar claims had been made by previous ministers. His claim for accountants was also within the rules, he added.  Claim: The foreign secretary claimed almost £30,000 for doing up his £120,000 constituency home over five years, it was reported. He spent up to £180 every three months on the garden at the property in South Shields. Additionally, he paid the husband of former Labour MP Meg Munn for tax advice.  Response: According to Mr Miliband's spokesman ""at every stage, David Miliband followed procedures and rules as laid out by the parliamentary authorities.""  Claim: The International Development Secretary's constituency home was damaged in a house fire in 2007 after he spent more than £30,000 on repairing it, according to the Telegraph.  He told the fees office he was ""under-insured"" and claimed almost £2,000 on items lost in the fire, which he later repaid when his insurers reimbursed him. He claimed £2,413 in accountancy bills and £230 for a digital camera, but was forced to pay a £750 bill for Christmas cards himself after being told they were not covered by the allowance. He also reportedly charged for advice from media consultant Scarlett McGwire and paid for advertising at lower league Johnstone Burgh FC.  Response: Mr Alexander said that he had sought the advice of the Fees Office after the fire that damaged his property, ""to obtain their guidance as to what it was appropriate to claim in these circumstances, given my continuing need for accommodation to allow me to undertake my work as an MP"". He said the camera was used to take photographs of constituency events.  Claim: The Home Secretary was reported to have bought husband Richard Timney, whom she employs as her assistant, a £240 Apple iPhone on her office expenses. Ms Smith had previously been forced to pay back £10 she had claimed for two adult films he watched.  She also charged the taxpayer for her accountancy costs and £1,600 for three digital cameras and a camcorder over three years.  Response: A spokesman for Ms Smith said the claims were needed for responses to ""constituents' needs"", according to the Daily Telegraph.  Claim: The Leader of the Commons claimed over £10,000 for the services of media consultant Scarlett McGwire. Ms Harman, who is Labour's deputy leader, submitted more than a dozen claims for the adviser's help between 2004 and 2007.  Response: A spokesman for Ms Harman said: ""The sum paid to Ms McGwire was in respect of advising on and drafting speeches, including speeches on flexible working for parents, on tackling domestic violence and increasing childcare; drafting questionnaires to her constituents; editing of her annual report to her constituents on issues such as housing, the NHS and policing; editing of constituency newsletters; and editing of other reports for her constituency and parliamentary work.""  Claim: The Environment Secretary claimed £1,882 for tax advice over a period of three years, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: Mr Benn, who is the MP for Leeds Central, has not yet commented on the report.  Claim: The Daily Telegraph alleged that the work and pensions secretary avoided paying capital gains tax on the sale of a London flat after claiming expenses for tax advice from an accountant. The paper says he also charged for a £395 accountant's bill that included advice on the sale of his flat.  Response: Mr Purnell is challenging the allegation that he avoided capital gains tax. A spokesman said any such suggestion was ""completely untrue"". He said Mr Purnell sought advice that the rules were the same for MPs as other taxpayers and asked Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to double-check his calculations. The spokesman added: ""When he bought his constituency home, the sale of his London flat fell through, but it was sold within the period that HMRC continue to treat it as not being liable for CGT. No one pays CGT when they sell the only house they own and James was not liable for capital gains tax on his London flat."" HMRC confirmed that there was no capital gains tax to pay, the spokesman said. Downing Street has said it was backing Mr Purnell.  Claim: The Telegraph says Ms Cooper re-designated, or ""flipped"", her second home from a property in South Yorkshire to the London home she owned with her husband Ed Balls in 2005 - after he was elected to the Commons. After that, the paper says the couple each claimed half of the share of their £1,468 mortgage interest costs. In May 2007, the couple moved to a larger home in London and began claiming £1,031 each in mortgage interest as well as £2,000 in moving costs. According to the paper, the two submitted the same claim twice in July 2006. Additionally, Mr Balls was said to have charged £33 for two Remembrance Sunday poppy wreaths, although the claim was turned down.  Response: Ms Cooper, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said she sought advice from the Commons authorities before changing her second home arrangement in 2005. The two MPs say they split the cost of bills evenly and since moving in 2007, have claimed less than in allowances than in the previous two years. Between them, they claimed just over £24,000 in 2007-8, above the £23,083 limit for a single MP but well below the £46,000 threshold for couples. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner investigated their second home arrangement in 2008 and approved it, pointing out the couple had paid capital gains tax on the flat sale. The couple said the 2006 'double claim' was an inadvertent error and the correct amount was paid once spotted. Mr Balls added that the claim for the wreaths ""was submitted in error by a staff member"".  The Medway MP claimed £118,000 for expenses at his second home, including stereo equipment, redecoration and a pair of Kenyan carpets, the Daily Telegraph reported. In 2006 he claimed £750 for a ""multi-room audio system"" and £830 for a DVD recorder and other electrical products.  Response: Mr Marshall-Andrews said the claims for his TV and DVD recorder were met from second home allowances ""in error"". They were used mainly for office purposes and should have been claimed as such, he told the paper. He added that all his other claims had been ""within the spirit and letter of the law"".  The Leeds North East MP declared his mother's London home as his main residence, letting him claim thousands of pounds on improving his family home in Leeds, the Daily Telegraph said. He also overcharged by £2,850 in 2004 by claiming for full mortgage payments when he was entitled only to the interest, it added.  After being challenged by the Commons authorities, Mr Hamilton offset £1,950 of the overpayment by submitting receipts for furniture, while agreeing that £900 could be docked from his next month's claim to account for the rest.  Response: Mr Hamilton said he spent the majority of his time with his mother before her death, paying a ""substantial"" sum towards the upkeep of her house.  Expenses submitted submitted by the Grimsby MP included 67p for Ginger Crinkle biscuits, 68p for Branston pickle and a bottle of malt whisky costing £22.99. In 2007, Mr Mitchell also claimed £2,938 for interior redecoration of his second home and £1,200 for re-upholstering sofas. He also had a bill for ""security shutters"" at his London second home turned down.  Response: Mr Mitchell's wife, Linda McDougall, told the Daily Telegraph that she had submitted the claims for food on her husband's behalf, and admitted that she ""made mistakes"". The MP himself said it had been necessary to have his sofas re-upholstered hundreds of miles away in Yorkshire because ""because everything is cheaper and better there"" but offered to donate the coverings to the Telegraph's offices. He added that he had suffered a series of break-ins prior to fitting the shutters, but there had been none since.  The Leytonstone and Wanstead MP claimed thousands for the redecoration of his second home before selling it and charging taxpayers £12,000 for stamp duty and fees on a new property, the Daily Telegraph said.  Among other items he was reported to have claimed were £1,222 for new blinds and £5,232 for furniture. Mr Cohen also claimed £4.25 for baby wipes and £8.75 for men's shaving oil.  Response: Mr Cohen said the house had been very dilapidated as the previous owner had lived there since 1933. He had used a back bedroom as an office, but his wife had a stroke while the refurbishment was being planned. This made it necessary to leave the three-floor property. He has offered to refund the cost of the toiletries.  The MP for Weaver Vale in Cheshire charged almost £15,000 in three years for his house in Kennington to be cleaned and for his clothes to be laundered and ironed.  Response: Mr Hall said his claims were ""legitimate and reasonable"" and reflected the cost of having to live and work in London.  The ex-whip, who is MP for Erewash in Derbyshire, spent hundreds of pounds just prior to the end of the financial year to take her second home claim as near to the maximum as possible, the Daily Telegraph alleged. Last-minute items included a £199 DVD player, a £150 fax and a £99 rug.  Response: Ms Blackman told the newspaper that the household items for her rented London flat were purchased ""with the full approval of the House authorities"".  The junior justice minister spent thousands on refurbishing a bathroom at one of her flats before ""flipping"" her second home designation to another property, the Sunday Telegraph said. Ms Eagle, MP for Liverpool Garston, was paid £3,500 in expenses towards the cost of the work.  Response: Ms Eagle told the newspaper that she had been ""scrupulous"" about sticking to the rules. She said she had been required to designate her London property as her main home when she became a minister in 2001. When this rule changed she switched the designation because she spent more time in Liverpool.  Claim: The Enfield North MP - whose seat is a 40-minute drive from the Commons - claimed expenses for £4,500 of repairs at her constituency home before ""flipping"" her second home to another south London property, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: Ms Ryan, a former junior Home Office minister, told the paper that the rules had required her to register her flat as her main home when she was in government because it was closest. But after she was dismissed from her role as Cyprus envoy, she switched it to the Enfield property as she spent more time there.  Claim: The MP for Erith and Thamesmead claimed more than £10,000 for the redecoration of his London flat, which was just 11 miles from his main home, before selling it for a £30,000 profit, the Daily Telegraph reported. After buying a new property, he claimed £10,000 in stamp duty and other expenses incurred in the move and a further £15,000 for a new bathroom, kitchen, carpets, and appliances.  Response: Mr Austin said the report was ""inaccurate and misleading"" and said he was seeking legal advice.  Claim: The Deputy Chief Whip and Labour MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West received £86,565 in second home expenses for his Westminster flat between 2004 and 2008. Most of these claims were mortgage interest payments of £1,000 a month, council tax and ground rent payments.  Response: Mr McAvoy has not responded to the report.  Claim: Mr Lucas - MP for Wrexham and a government whip - claimed approximately £1,000 a month for mortgage interest payments on a London flat, which he sold for a £45,000 profit, the Daily Telegraph said. Taxpayers were then billed £6,000 for sale fees. Mr Lucas then claimed almost £4,000 for staying in hotels before buying a new flat and claiming for stamp duty, purchasing fees, furniture and mortgage interest payments. He also spent £550 on a ""hip hop"" bed and extra-firm mattress, and £838 on a sofa bed.  Response: The MP said he been ""scrupulous"" in adhering to the rules, adding that he was ""confident that I have achieved the appropriate balance between seeking the support I need to perform my duties as MP for Wrexham, and responsible use of the allowances available to me"".  Claim: Ms Jones, an assistant government whip, claimed £87,647 on her London flat between 2004 and 2008, most of which was made up of mortgage interest payments.  Response: The Warrington MP told the Liverpool Daily Post: ""The fees office has said there is nothing in my expenses that they are concerned about.""  Claim: Ms Goodman claimed for a week's stay in a holiday cottage in her Bishop Auckland constituency over a bank holiday, the Daily Telegraph said.  It reported that she submitted a £519.31 claim to the fees office for the cottage in Romaldkirk, Teesdale, between 27 August and 3 September 2005.  Response: The MP - a government whip - told the BBC that she has a large, rural constituency and that before she had a house there she stayed in hotels or rented. During the summer 2005 recess, she wanted to work in the constituency for 10 days and it was cheaper to rent a cottage with her family than stay in a hotel. She worked every day of her stay and has the documentation to prove it, she added.  Claim: After splitting up with his wife, Mr Mahmood checked into a five-star London hotel with his then-girlfriend at taxpayers' expense.  The Daily Telegraph said the Birmingham Perry Barr MP used the Bentley in Kensington for nine nights over a four-week period in 2004 at a cost of £1,350.  He spent a further five nights there in 2008, claiming £1,225.  Response: Mr Mahmood said he had got the most deal possible for the taxpayer. ""I tried looking for other places and that was the best I could get,"" he told the Daily Telegraph. Mr Mahmood, who gave up his rented London flat in December 2008, said using hotels was cheaper than paying for properties that were unoccupied for much of the year.  The MP for South Derbyshire claimed £24,877 in expenses to refurbish his second home in London. Kitchen units, lighting, bathroom items, carpets, tiles leather chairs and a marble table were all among the goods for which he claimed.  Response: Mr Todd - who in 2007 announced his intention to stand down at the next election - said he would refund the fees office for an amount reflecting the items' depreciation when he retires.  Claim: Mr Clapham tried to claim £210 for a pair of glasses for his wife, Yvonne, who he employs as his office assistant, the Daily Telegraph said. But the fees office reduced his payment to £50, telling the Barnsley West & Penistone MP this was the maximum allowable for glasses. He also claimed £64 for dinner services and £19.97 for an iron.  Response: Mr Clapham points out that the dinner set was claimed on the wrong form and, although he was advised to resubmit it, he was too busy to do so. Consequently he never received the money and it will not appear on the official Commons expenses data when it is released.  Claim: The Leicester South MP claimed for bailiffs' fees after the rent on his constituency office fell into arrears. But the fees office said he was not liable for the £472.59 bill and refunded his claim.  Response: Sir Peter told the paper that the arrears were ""entirely the fees office's fault"" after they failed to process a bill.  Claim: The Derby North MP claimed £1,049 for a flat screen TV and £1,456 for a double bed in his London second home.  Response: Mr Laxton told the Telegraph that he ""didn't really particularly have the time to run around and get deals on a TV or beds"".  Claim: Mr Davies, who defected from the Conservatives to Labour, spent more than £10,000 repairing window frames at his 18th century mansion in Lincolnshire, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The defence minister - also MP for Grantham and Stamford - claimed close to the maximum allowable on second home expenses between 2004 and 2008.  Response: Mr Davies told the Telegraph that his expenses were ""entirely legitimate"" and that he had ""absolutely nothing to hide"". He insisted that the cost of upkeep on his home was considerably more than that for which he was reimbursed by the fees office.  Claim: The Oxford East MP claimed for renovations and repairs worth £30,000 on his south London home. Some of the invoices for the work, which included a new kitchen and bathroom, new windows and a hallway, were addressed to his constituency home.  Response: Mr Smith told the newspaper that he had kept to the spirit and letter of the rules, and that all goods claimed had been for the London property.  Ms Smith, elected MP for Sheffield Hillsborough in 2005, claimed for four beds for her one-bedroom London flat, the Daily Telegraph said. The paper reported that she kitted out her flat in 2005 with items at a cost of £7,800 including a king-size bed and two futons. Then in 2006 she bought a £950 sofa bed and a chair worth £550 because she said the futons were broken. Ms Smith also claimed hundreds of pounds for tax advice from Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn.  Response: Ms Smith told the newspaper that she had not claimed for home contents in 2008/9 and would not do so again. She added: ""Future replacement costs will be borne by myself."" In a joint statement with three other MPs, she said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue for 12 years.  Claim: The fees office rejected a £16.50 receipt submitted by Mr Levitt, the MP for High Peak, for the cost of a poppy wreath he laid during Remembrance Sunday commemorations. He was also asked to justify a £5,281 bill for renovations. This was granted, but the fees office refused to refund the full cost of fitting a bathroom at £8,013.77, the Daily Telegraph said. An examination of his previous mortgage interest payments by the fees office showed that he had over-claimed by £6,000, which he duly returned.  Response: Mr Levitt told the newspaper that the fees office was ""quite right"" to reject the poppy wreath claim. With regards to the bathroom, he said: """"The replacement was 'like for like' with the only 'enhancement' being a bathroom cupboard with a shaving mirror above the sink - there was not one there before. And labour costs in London are not cheap."" He added: ""As a former member of the Standards and Privileges Committee, my conscience is clear.""  Claim: Ms Munn's husband Dennis Bates was paid over £5,000 to provide tax advice to at least five ministers, the Daily Telegraph said. Ms Munn, the MP for Sheffield Heeley and a former Foreign Office minister, employs Mr Bates as her parliamentary assistant at taxpayers' expense. Ms Munn published her expenses claims on her website, but blacked out the section which showed she had paid her husband for tax advice tax using her expenses.  Response: Ms Munn has not yet commented. But in a statement, four of the ministers who received advice from her husband said Mr Bates, who worked at the Inland Revenue for 12 years, was ""eminently qualified"" to make sure MPs were meeting their liabilities.  Claim: Mr Knight, the schools minister and MP for Dorset South, was one of several MPs who paid Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn, from their parliamentary allowances for tax advice, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: Mr Knight told the BBC that Mr Bates's services were cheaper than than those of the previous accountant he had used. In a joint statement with three other MPs, Mr Knight said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue.  Claim: Mr Healey, the local government minister and MP for Wentworth in South Yorkshire, was one of several MPs who paid Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn, from their parliamentary allowances for tax advice, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: In a joint statement with three other MPs, Mr Healey said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue for 12 years.  Claim: Ms Merron, the foreign office minister and M for Lincoln, was one of several MPs who paid Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn, from their parliamentary allowances for tax advice, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: In a joint statement with three other MPs, Ms Merron said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue for 12 years.  Claim: The former deputy leader of the Commons submitted receipts for £3,600 worth of electronic equipment. When the fees office questioned the claim for a TV, DVD player and digital radio in 2004, Mr Griffiths said that, as a Scottish MP, he needed to ""listen to Scottish radio"" and watch ""Scottish TV"".  The fees office turned down his request on the basis that the ""level of purchase"" remained under question.  Response: The Edinburgh South MP admitted that he had made the claim but that it had not been agreed.  ""I asked the fees office whether these items were refundable and was told to put the request in writing, which I did. The fees office came to the view that they were not eligible for funding.  ""None of the items were paid for out of any parliamentary allowance.""  Claim: The MP for Stockton-on-Tees claimed for a £5 donation that he made at a church service to commemorate the Battle of Britain. It was rejected by the House of Commons fees office.  Response: Mr Cook said he had ""no recollection"" of asking to be reimbursed, but accepted that the Telegraph would not have invented the claim and said it was ""wrong"" that it happened.  Claim: The MP for Dover and Deal paid his brother from his expenses to carry out work at his London flat, even though he lived almost 200 miles away. He also claimed for work done on another London property that he owned, although it was no longer his designated second home for three years and he was renting it out.  Response: Mr Prosser said that he had informed the fees office about employing his brother.  ""I phoned a number of London contractors and their estimates for the flooring job alone was more than £200 more than my brother's charge for the whole job so it was good value for money.""  On the subject of the other flat, the Labour backbencher said that he had done nothing wrong.  ""I was living in the flat when the notices were published and the work was carried out. Six months later I moved to my current flat. The invoices for payment should have been sent to me when I was still resident and had they done this my ACA claim would have been settled forthwith.""  Claim: The former Oscar-winning actress repaid £8,000 she claimed towards the publication of an annual report.  She agreed to pay back the money because of a reference to the Labour Party which is a breach of parliamentary rules.  Response: The MP for Hampstead and Highgate said she had not fully read the document and missed the mention of Labour.  ""I failed to proof read a line at the very end of the document which mentioned the party and I have paid back the money.""  Claim: The Telegraph says that the Labour backbencher made claims for a bath mat, gardening equipment and more than £7,000 for property repairs at his home in Birmingham, labelling them as office costs.  The Telegraph also suggests that Mr Godsiff claimed the maximum in second home expenses to cover the mortgage interest of his property in London.  Response: The Sparkbrook & Small Health MP says that he will check to see whether the report was correct.  ""If there is anything that shouldn't have been claimed for then I will gladly go through the files and check it out, and if there is anything inappropriate then I will make recompense.""  Mr Godsiff insists that all claims for his Birmingham home were approved by the fees office because it is also his office, where his secretary worked.  ""She [his secretary] has an office on the property. She also has storage space, where all the old files are kept. The fees office was aware of the arrangement right from the beginning.""  Claim: The Staffordshire Moorlands MP claimed more than £35,000 for renovations to her second home, which included £20,000 for windows and £4,000 for pulling down and rebuilding a chimney.  The parliamentary fees office disputed Miss Atkins claim, arguing that the request for the windows was ""beyond the definition for allowable work set out in the Green Book"" so she was not fully reimbursed.  Response: The Labour backbencher said that the property in Leeds did need some work. ""I bought my second home cheaply because it required some repair so my mortgage interest claim was low but my repair bill was high.""  Claim: The former transport minister got involved in a row with the fees office over claims he made for a baby cot and steriliser at his second home in London.  Having had his claims for the items rejected by the fees office, Mr Harris wrote to them arguing that ""MPs by necessity have to own two of almost everything"".  Response: The Glasgow South MP argues that his claim was valid because he only lives in London as part of his job as an MP.  Claim: The Telegraph reports that Mr Donohoe made a £2,575 claim for a three-piece sofa suite for his second home, designated as his London address, although the address on the invoice was his main home in Ayrshire.  Mr Donohoe produced another receipt with the London address and the fees office left it at that.  Response: The Central Ayrshire MP says that the items were intended for his second home.  ""The furniture was in fact delivered to London, and is in my current flat.""  Claim: The Daily Telegraph says Mr Ainsworth, MP for Coventry North East, submitted two invoices for £8,025 in 2005 for repair and redecoration of his second home in his constituency. Work carried out, according to the paper, included removing a wall, fitting oak beams in the ceiling, removing pipes next to the fireplace, preparing floors to be laminated, fitting pine doors and installing a gate. It says he also tried to claim for a £2,225 sofa and a £1,000 television but was told these were excessive. It adds that he switched his second home to a London flat in 2007.  Response: The armed forces minister said he was only reimbursed for necessary repair work - including removing a dangerous chimney, rewiring unsafe cables and fixing corrosive pipes - and paid for separate improvements out of his own pocket. All his claims were within the rules while he accepted the caps on the costs of the sofa and television.  Claim: Following inquiries by local media, the MP for Stafford raised concerns with the Commons authorities about his expenses claims for 2007-8. He was told that he had been overpaid for claims he made for council tax and water bills by £2,427.88. The Fees Office said it was ""extremely sorry"" for the situation which it said was caused by a ""number of errors"" within its operation.  Response: Mr Kidney said he was unaware of the discrepancy in his claims and ""horrified"" to learn of the Fees Office's mistakes. He has repaid the money.  Claim: The Plymouth Sutton MP met with the Commons authorities to discuss her claims and found ""significant changes"" would have to be made. It emerged she had been under-paid in some years and over-paid in others while some claims had been attributed to the wrong years.  Response: Ms Gilroy said she would repay £1,891 and submit her claims to the Commons committee on members' allowances. But she insisted she had not made any financial gains and, if anything, had been left ""out of pocket"".  Claim: The Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP attempted to claim £3,371 for furniture, including £768 for a Man Ray styling chair and £1,434 for a sofabed, but was refunded only £3,075, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: In a statement, Mr Ainger said: ""I have been in the lowest quarter of MPs for claims in each of the four years."" He has published his expenses on his website.  Claim: Mr Allen, MP for Nottingham North, claimed £495 for the service charge on his London flat and the maximum £400 monthly for food ""on most occasions"", the Telegraph said. His food claims were reduced when he attempted to claim more than £500 a month on two occasions, the paper added.  Response: On his website, Mr Allen says: ""The media constantly misrepresent the costs MPs need to do their jobs as 'expenses' - making people think that money is being paid into MPs' pockets. Electors who want to think for themselves cannot rely on the media: they need and deserve the truth."" He says he supports a range of reforms including a Parliamentary block of flats in London for MPs to live in and a ban on second and third jobs for MPs.  Claim: The Blaydon MP's mortgage interest costs totalled £1,203 by April 2006, the Telegraph said. It added that he claimed for furniture, a washing machine and a microwave, as well as between £200 and £400 each month for food.  Response: Mr Anderson has not responded to the report to date.  Claim: Ms Barlow, MP for Hove, used her second home allowance to spend more than £28,000 on stamp duty, legal costs and renovations despite telling the fees office that the property would become her main home, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: Ms Barlow told the newspaper that the fees office asked if she intended to make the Hove address her main home. ""I said that I probably would do so which I did after the move to Hove was concluded,"" she added. ""I was advised to claim for the cost of moving into the Hove home."" She added that the move took time because her children went to school in Chichester and that she had stopped claiming Additional Costs Allowance in October 2006.  Claim: Mr Barron claimed a London flat in 2004/5 as his second home with a monthly mortgage interest of £1,509, which rose to £1,791 in 2005/6, the Daily Telegraph said. This increased in to more than £2,000 the following year.  Response: To date the Rother Valley MP has not responded to the report.  Claim: The Leeds West MP claim the maximum £400 a month food allowance after consulting with the fees office, the Daily Telegraph said. He also claimed £499 for a dark brown sofa and £599 for a recliner.  Response: Mr Battle has not responded to the report.  Claim: Mr Bayley, MP for the City of York, said a flat in London rather than York was his second home and claimed £1,177 monthly mortgage interest, the Daily Telegraph said. Later, he nominated York as second home, the paper added.  Response: Mr Bayley has not responded to the report.  Claim: Ms Begg spent £1,403 on furniture for the living room of her London flat and £500 on Devonshire carpets for two bedrooms, the Daily Telegraph said. It also reported that the Aberdeen South MP claimed £85,245 over four years.  Response: On her website, Ms Begg wrote: ""I feel confident that, as well as not breaking any rules, I have also acted in an ethical and responsible manner.""  Claim: Sir Stuart claimed £750 for food in December 2005, reduced to the maximum monthly amount of £400, according to the Daily Telegraph. He claimed £1,400 a month rent on his second home, a flat in London, the paper also reported.  Response: The Middlesbrough MP told the Journal newspaper that his claims were ""perfectly reasonable"".  Claim: The Bootle MP claimed £400 a month for food during the 2005 summer recess, according to the Daily Telegraph. In 2008 spent £1,500 repairing his second home, the paper reported.  Response: Mr Benton has not commented on the report.  Claim: The Kingswood MP's expenses for his London second home included a £696 Sony 26-inch LCD TV, a £250 DVD player, a £1067.49 washer-dryer, and a dishwasher costing £574.28, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: Mr Berry told the Bristol Evening Post: ""I believe that I have been reasonable but I think there should be a completely independent group of people that go through every MP's expenses. They should have the power to order MPs to pay back anything they think is unreasonable and if they decided any of mine were, I would gladly do that.""  Claim: The MP for Sheffield Attercliffe claimed £1,268 for carpets, £689.99 for a television, £1,135.20 for a bed, £570 for a sofa bed; £1,220 on furniture and £1,433.50 on decoration, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: On his website, Mr Betts said: ""My intention, in submitting any claims, has been to comply with the spirit as well as the words of any rules and guidance.""  Claim: The City of Durham MP claimed £9,425.19 in stamp duty and other costs incurred buying a London flat and subsequently claimed £1,364.29 monthly for mortgage interest payments.  Response: Ms Blackman-Woods said her mortgage interest payments cost the taxpayer less than renting in central London. In a statement on her website, she added: ""I have always been open, honest and transparent about the expenses and allowances I have claimed since serving as Durham's MP. I have had details of my expenses on my website for many years.""  Claim: Mr Blizzard, MP for Waveney, claims £1,278.25 each month for mortgage interest payments on his London second home, the Daily Telegraph said. It added that he ""made few other claims"", one of which was £363 for a washing machine.  Response: Mr Blizzard wrote on his website that ""all of the money I have claimed from the 'second homes' allowances relates to the cost of living in London"".  Claim: The two Labour ministers have claimed more than £100,000 for a shared London flat since May 2005, according to the Telegraph. The ministers each claimed for their share of the legal costs involved in purchasing the property and then later for the fees to buy the freehold.  Response: Neither has yet responded. Tom Watson stood down as a minister on 5 June, saying the the ""pressure on my young family has been painful"" during his time in office.  Three cabinet members in particular are singled out for their ""modest"" claims under the second homes allowance by the Telegraph. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband had only put in claims for £6,300 a year in rent for his constituency home and for utility and council tax bills. Health Secretary Alan Johnson rented a ""modest"" property but claimed for food and some furniture. Environment Secretary Hilary Benn claimed only £147.78 for food from the allowance which allows MPs to claim up to about £24,000 a year.  Laura Moffat, the Labour backbencher whose Crawley seat is the most marginal in the country, was singled out for praise by the Daily Telegraph. She gave up her flat overlooking the Thames for a camp bed in her office because she did not feel comfortable charging taxpayers for her rent.  Chris Mullin, MP for Sunderland South, gets by with a black and white TV. He claimed the reduced £45 licence fee on his second homes allowance.  Birkinhead MP and possible candidate for the Speaker's chair Frank Field claimed just £9,573 for his constituency home."
540,"The blaze, on the slopes of Mount Parnitha, is being contained, officials say, but a huge plume of black smoke is towering over the city.  Electricity pylons, exploding after a record heatwave, have sparked some of the fires, but arson is also suspected.  The fire near Athens is one of more than 100 blazes which have broken out across Greece in the last few days.  Overnight, residents of Athens could see the heavily-forested slopes of Mount Parnitha burning on the horizon.  On Friday morning, Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras said: ""We have successfully handled a difficult task.""  But he said the fight to extinguish the flames continued, and water-bombing aircraft and helicopters have resumed dousing the flames  The strong winds fuelling the fire have dropped and firefighters have so far prevented the blaze from reaching the suburbs of Athens.  An air force radar station, a casino and a summer holiday camp on the mountain, 25km (16 miles) from Athens, have been evacuated.  ""My area was spared, but unfortunately the forest is no longer there,"" the mayor of Thramakedones told Greek radio.  The forests of Mount Parnitha are popular with Athenians wanting to escape the heat of the city. They are considered the lungs of heavily-polluted Athens, reports the BBC's Malcolm Brabant.  More than 120 fires have broken out across the country in the last two days, but most of the them have been extinguished, officials say.  Eleven people have died in the nine-day heatwave, one of the longest recorded in Greece.  Most have died from heat stroke or heart attacks. On Thursday, two volunteer firefighters were trapped by flames and died of smoke inhalation in the centre of the country.  Temperatures have now dropped below 40C, after peaking at 46C earlier in the week, but forecasters say another heatwave is expected next week."
541,"Since the Cursing Stone was placed in Carlisle, the city has suffered floods, foot-and-mouth disease, job losses and a goal famine for the football team.  Now the city council is considering destroying the stone, to try to bring the run of bad luck to an end.  But Kevin Carlyon, high priest of the British White Witches, says that would only increase belief in its power.  He said: ""A curse can only work if people believe in it. I think at the moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse.  ""Most of us have some kind of superstition, and I think that destroying the stone would be very bad for Carlisle because it would feed that power.  ""The council could make things a lot worse for the city.""  The 14-tonne stone is inscribed with a 1,069-word 16th Century curse which was first invoked by the Archbishop of Glasgow against cross-border families, known as the ""reivers"", blamed for stealing cattle, rape and pillage.  It was designed by artist Gordon Young whose own ancestors were reivers, and who believes recent events have nothing to do with the stone.  He said: ""I think there are enough rational people on the council to make sure there's no chance of it being destroyed, but the fact that they are considering that is truly amazing.  ""Having been brought up in Carlisle, I can remember factories catching fire, flooding, unemployment, and consecutive relegations by Carlisle United. It just doesn't stack up for one second.""  The council is meeting on Tuesday evening do discuss the fate of the Cursing Stone, which would cost the council about £7,500 to remove."
542,"Carlisle United have revealed plans to move from their Brunton Park home to a new stadium at Kingmoor in the north of the city.  The plans that would see a new 12,000 all-seater stadium built, ending a 102-year stay at their present home, were revealed to shareholders on Thursday.  Funding for the venue and surrounding buildings under the proposals would come from a development partner.  In addition, the new stadium would have office and training facilities.  A feasibility study found that the club's current site was a costly and unsuitable option for redevelopment.  Kingmoor Park was recommended by the study from 17 potential sites.  ""Everyone was very happy with the proposal,"" CUFC Online independent website editor Tim Graham told BBC Radio Cumbria, having attended the meeting.  ""From what the board were saying and the feasibity study, everyone in the meeting was for it.  ""Once everyone realises what's involved with it, I think a lot of people will be for it to be honest.""  The Cumbrians' existing ground meets the criteria set by the Football League to play in the bottom two tiers, but would not be suitable under regulations beyond that for the Championship.  ""Football League regulations, released in 2009, stipulated minimum ground standards which we are currently struggling to meet within Brunton Park,"" chairman John Nixon said within the statement.  ""The board would be doing a disservice to the fans if we didn't look into the future options for the club and report back to them for their input.""  Carlisle's next step is to present the findings and results of the study to supporters, which will take place on 24 November."
543,"The Oscar-winning American actor, Walter Matthau, has died of a heart attack aged 79. He was pronounced dead on Saturday morning shortly after being brought into St John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, said a hospital spokesman.       Over a carreer that spanned more than 40 years, Matthau, who became a Hollywood legend, appeared in more than 50 films. He was a popular character actor, and went from playing villains to become the modern king of the entertainment world's grumpy but lovable slobs. He is best known for his decades-long screen partnership with Jack Lemmon. It was their first duet in a 1966 film the Fortune Cookie that earned Matthau stardom. Matthau would later say of Lemmon: ""When were working we always seemed to understand what we're thinking about.""       Lemmon, himself a famous comedian, praised the funny side of Matthau. ""The biggest problem, and the only problem, I have working with Walter, who is a great actor, is that I have a great deal of difficulty not laughing."" Matthau's most recent comedy, Hanging Up, was released only this year, starring Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. Matthau's first big Broadway performance was in 1948, but it was his 1965 appearance in Neil Simon's The Odd Couple that launched him into stardom. The film version of the show released in 1968 became a classic.          The biggest problem, and the only problem, I have working with Walter, who is a great actor, is that I have a great deal of difficulty not laughing    Matthau won the Academy Award for best supporting actor for Billy Wilder's 1966 comedy The Fortune Cookie. In May 1993 he was honoured with a Lifetime's Achievement Award by America's National Association of Theatre Owners. The actor survived several serious health setbacks during his career. While making The Fortune Cookie in 1966, he suffered a bad heart attack. His doctor attributed it to smoking three packs a day and constant worry about gambling and told him to give up both. Matthau stopped smoking.          When were working we always seemed to understand what we're thinking about    In 1976, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in freezing weather for Grumpy Old Men in 1993, he was hospitalised for double pneumonia. In December 1995, he had a colon tumor removed. It tested benign. He was also hospitalised in May 1999 for more than two months after another bout with pneumonia. When Matthau was brought into St John's Health Center hospital on Saturday morning, he was in ""full cardiac arrest"" and was pronounced dead at 0142 am PDT (0842 am GMT)."
544,"Television ratings are 15% up from the 2000 Games in Sydney, while ticket sales have topped figures from the Seoul and Barcelona Olympics.  ""The organisation was outstanding and we had competitions in state-of-the-art venues,"" said Rogge, who described the security precautions as ""flawless"".  ""They really did a fantastic job. I am very, very happy about the Games.  ""We have discovered a new Greece. Greece was great for the Games.  ""These have been unforgettable dream Games. These Games were held in peace and brotherhood. These were the Games where it became increasingly difficult to cheat and where clean athletes were better protected.""  Rogge's predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch had hailed the 2000 Games in Sydney as the greatest Olympiad ever.  But Rogge gave a diplomatic response when asked whether the Athens Games were better.  He said: ""You cannot compare Games that are held at different times and in different countries.""  But despite all the praise, Rogge sent a chilling warning there could be more positive drug tests than the 22 recorded so far in Athens.  ""The list is probably not over,"" said the Belgian. ""You have 10,500 athletes in the Olympic village, you do not have 10,500 saints. You will always have cheats.""  The combined performances of China, Japan and South Korea also impressed Rogge, who described their efforts as the ""awakening of Asia"" and an ominous sign for the rest of the world ahead of the 2008 Games in Beijing."
545,"It announced that the country would send a team to try to prove that the seabed beneath the North Pole was a natural continuation of Greenland.  The world's largest island is a semi-independent Danish territory whose northern tip is around 725km (450 miles) from the Pole.  Possible claimants to the area with the Pole also include Russia and Canada.  ""We're seeing a growing focus on and fight for the resources in the Arctic, especially as the global warming makes the region more accessible,"" Samantha Smith of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) told Reuters news agency.  Danish scientists hope to prove through hi-tech measurements that Greenland's continental socket is attached to a huge ridge beneath the floating Arctic ice, the Associated Press reports.  The country has allocated 150 million kroner ($25m) for the project on the Lomonosov Ridge and four other potential claim areas around Greenland, reports say.  Science Minister Helge Sander said last week that success would give Denmark access to ""new resources such as oil and natural gas"".  The Danish bid also rests on a UN convention that allows coastal nations to claim rights to offshore seabed resources.  Countries that ratify it have 10 years to prove they have a fair claim to the offshore territory and its resources.  ""First, we have to make the scientific claim. After that, there will be a political process with the other countries,"" science ministry official Thorkild Meedom said.  But experts have warned that it could take years to sort out the overlapping potential claims in the Arctic.  Canada and Russia are making similar investigations around the North Pole, the Associated Press reports."
546,"Sweden has decided not to ban sexist advertising, saying it would risk undermining the country's cherished right to freedom of speech. In Norway, ads can use sexual images but they must be relevant But the decision puts the country at odds with its Nordic neighbours. Norway and Denmark have strict limits on the use of such images for commercial gain. In Norway, sexist advertising has been banned since 2003. The ban forms part of a much broader package of legal limits on advertising, protecting the depiction of religion, sexuality, race and gender. ""Basically, if something is offensive or it makes the viewer feel uncomfortable when they look at it, it shouldn't be done"", explained Sol Olving, head of Norway's Kreativt Forum, an association of the country's top advertising agencies. ""Naked people are wonderful, of course, but they have to be relevant to the product. You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream, but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car."" Norwegian firms that refuse to remove or alter offensive adverts after having a complaint upheld face a hefty fine of 500,000 Norwegian kroner (£49,000; 62,500 euros). But Ms Olving says there were no complaints about the law from advertisers, who have learnt to come up with less obvious ways of persuading consumers to part with their cash. We're not that puritan that you can't have naked bodies - but it has to be done in the right way, with charm and passion    But in Denmark, where similar guidelines have been in place since 1993, some firms are ready to exploit the additional free publicity they will get from being highlighted. Denmark's advertising ombudsman recounts a recent example of a male underwear company which was forced to withdraw adverts portraying women in low-paid jobs, after outrage from several trade unions. One ad in the series showed a nurse lying on a bed with the male underpants covering her face, implying that she had just had sex with a patient. ""People in these different occupations already have problems with sexual discrimination,"" says ombudsman Henrik Oe. ""You cannot play on the male fantasy that a patient can have sex with a nurse just to sell a product."" ""These areas of employment are already ones where women are already vulnerable to sexual harassment,"" he added. Both Norway and Denmark are keen to emphasise that their advertising limits do not prevent freedom of speech, stifle creativity or mean that there is never a beautiful naked human form on display. In Denmark, Mr Oe says, many advertisers are becoming increasingly creative, using humour to stretch the boundaries and appeal to Danish consumers. He says he receives only around 10 complaints about sexist advertising each year and that firms normally remove the offending images quickly. From Oslo, Ms Olving says: ""We're not that puritan that you can't have naked bodies. But it has to be done in the right way, with charm and passion."" Sweden says freedom of expression is a fundamental right Sweden, however, despite commissioning a special government rapporteur to look into the matter, is not following the legal professor's advice that freedom of speech does not extend to commercial messages and limits are needed. ""This law would be against freedom of speech, which is protected by the constitution,"" said Malin Engstedt, spokesperson for Equality Minister Nyamko Sabuni. ""The minister is not convinced that this law would improve things,"" she added. Ms Engstedt said the Swedish government was confident that efforts made by the country's advertisers themselves - including the introduction of an ombudsman similar to Denmark's to oversee adverts - would be more effective. ""They are more than capable of finding other ways of advertising their products,"" she said."
547,"   Ask a little girl what her favourite colour is, and chances are she'll shout ""pink"". Toy aisles and clothing rails are packed with this shade, but is nothing but pink for girls harmful? How different it was in the early 1900s, when blue was for girls and pink for boys. Any colour so long as it's pink The Women's Journal explained it thus: ""That pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl."" DressMaker magazine agreed. ""The preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler, and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger (akin to red)."" What prompted the switch is unclear, but it had been made by the time Adolf Hitler ordered the classification of homosexuals. Those deemed ""curable"" were sent to concentration camps and labelled with a pink triangle. This suggests that by then, pink was associated with femininity. But some commentators now believe pink dominates the upbringing of little girls, and this may be damaging. Sue Palmer, author of Toxic Childhood, says the ""total obsession"" with pink stunts girls' personalities. ""I am very worried about it. You can't find girls over the age of three who aren't obsessed with the colour. It's under their skin from a very early age and severely limits choices, and decisions. The effect of pink is temporary - it is not the profound negative effect that is being argued    ""We have got to get something done about the effect marketeers are having. We are creating little fluffy pink princess, an image of girliness, that is very specific and which some girls don't want to go along with, but due to overwhelming peer pressure, are having to conform to."" So successful have toymakers been in creating a girl's world painted purely pink, that a study by speech therapists in Durham shows children having no problem identifying the colour blue, but saying ""Barbie"" when shown pink. But therapist and researcher Michael Gurian, who is based in the United States, says too much pink doesn't have a profound effect biologically - because it can't. Are girls now less likely to play rough? He says humans are programmed in a certain way and no amount of contact with external influences can change that. ""Everyone is hard-wired with four things - gender, a talent set, personality and differing ability to deal with trauma. ""I agree that if you are saying the environment has no effect on these, you go too far the other way, but the effect is negligible."" Mr Gurian, the author of Nurture The Nature, says the only thing that can profoundly change the way a girl is programmed to develop is a chemical imbalance or some kind of serious trauma. For example, he says images of thin models and actresses do not cause a person to become anorexic - there are more complicated factors at work. It is the same with over-exposure to pink (or any other single colour that might have been assigned to girls). ""Scientists all argue the same thing - you cannot have a biological organism without having an environment for it to exist in, but that environment does not change the very basic make-up of that organism. ""The effect is more temporary. It is not the profound negative effect that is being argued."" Enter any toy store or children's clothing department and it's easy to spot the gender divide - one side is floor-to-ceiling pink, the other camouflage shades with the odd dash of orange and blue. Hence discussion boards on parenting websites bemoan the fact it is ""impossible"" to buy any other colour for girls. My girls love pink - it's their favourite colour, but equally they are happy in the garden wallowing in mud    As girls are more aware of colour than boys - they put more colour in their drawings, for example, and learn colour names more quickly - it is no surprise that toy manufacturers have latched onto a certain shade to pitch at girls. ""It could've been any colour,"" says Mr Gurian. Boys too have their own stereotypes and colour palette to contend with, but feminists argue that these aren't as marginalising. Girls are already fighting inequality, they say. Mr Gurian says those who rail against pink think it means ""girl, girl, girl, which means not smart, which means oppressed"". But girls believed to have been harmed by too much pink are actually either ""traumatised by something, or not given the opportunities to develop their natural talents. That has nothing to do with pink."" Maria Dawes, a mother to two girls aged four and three, says: ""My girls love pink - it's their favourite colour, but equally they are happy in the garden wallowing in mud. Surely this is all just about balanced and sensible parenting? ""Exposure to all things pink does bother me a bit, but in the end, they will make their own decisions as they mature."" Mr Gurian himself has two teenage girls. ""My daughters love pink, but are very successful young women. Their love of pink and of girl stuff has not held them back."" Ms Palmer, too, has a daughter, and when she was little she played with a pastel-pretty My Little Pony. ""I tried hard for her not to have one, but she did. We were rock bottom broke though, so I couldn't give in to the pink pester power too much, thankfully."" Below is a selection of your comments. I agree the colour itself is not dangerous (I'm happily wearing bright pink at the moment), it's more a symptom of how society likes to box girls and women in, by expecting very specific things from them. I agree that stick-thin models don't cause anorexia, but they do cause feelings of inadequacy in a lot of girls and women (myself included).   Harriet R, Bristol, UK I always used to love pink as a child - I was given pink towels, pink fairy dresses and pink toy rabbits while my sister was given the same in blue. I was glad until about eight, when I wanted to grow out of it. Unfortunately my relatives disagreed and I used to die a little inside whenever I opened a present to find a bright pink pair of trousers or another pink fluffy animal. But I don't think I've been damaged by it, except I now loathe pink. I had to get my bedroom carpet changed because it was a particularly bright shade when I moved recently.   Anna, Beaconsfield, England When my daughter was little her favourite colours were pink and shiny. She had red hair and it clashed like crazy. But who cares? She was happy. Now she is grown and over the years her opinions have changed with her mood and occasionally with fashion. She is a strong, confident woman. What has pink got to do with that?   Alix The propensity of pink is not the only issue here as far as I am concerned. Whole aisles are dedicated to pink products, but blue is in scarce supply. My baby son looks really good in blue, however it is really difficult to get hold of blue clothes for him. In any shop you can get a huge amount of pink for girls, but for boys you generally have to go for neutral as there does not seem to be much blue. We wanted to get blue babygrows for him but despite a lot of searching we only got a couple, whereas if I had a girl and required pink I could have picked them up in all shops. More gender equality in baby clothes, please retailers.   Matt, Cheshire The shops only sell pink because that's what we buy based on the demands of little girls. I had no intention of dressing my daughter in pink, but that's all she wanted. I would offer her clothing in all sorts of lovely colours but she only wanted pink. And with each season's new offerings in the shops - usually with other new colours - she still wanted pink. It wasn't until she was 8 that she finally decided that pink was out.   Susan Hunt, Leidschendam, The Netherlands I don't see what the problem is. My daughter likes pink but she also likes all the other colours too. If a child is fixated on something it is not down to manufacturers or marketing, it is an in-built character trait. My daughter's room is pink, she has Barbies but most of her clothing is not pink and most of her toys and room accessories are not pink. Allow your children to be children. They will enter the adult world soon enough.   V Leese, Southampton, England I try desperately to avoid pink clothes for my 21-month-old daughter. But it's difficult to buy girls clothes in any other colour. I cringe when I walk through the ""girls"" section of toy shops because it turns completely pink. When I buy her toys I try to go for gender neutral ones. When I play with her it's with footballs or on my skateboard. But she loves pushing around a toy pram. A friend bought her a Barbie doll (to my horror), and she loved it. Sorry feminists, I tried, I really did.   Alan Holt, Malmesbury My 20 month old daughter is in purple today and my four year is in black and white. They have orange, red, blue, green, white and black clothes, oh and pink and I'm not loaded. There is a lot of pink but there are other colours too. Do not be pressured by your child to buy pink.   Nadine Norton, Shrewsbury My two year old niece seems oblivious to colour, especially when picking her clothes. Instead, the article of clothing is of more importance (shirt and pants v dress). However, whatever piece of clothing selected will invariably be put and worn on her head.    Leila, Canada I struggle to see how a girl's choice in clothing is limited. All the clothing stores I go to consist of four floors of girls clothes and two racks of boys clothes hidden at the back of the top floor.   Owen, London Kids change, thankfully. My daughter used to love the colour, had to have her room painted in a particularly nauseating hue, but now can't stand it. Her change kind of happened about the time she realised she didn't like Barbie anymore.    Iain, Dunfermline When I think about what I'm very worried about on behalf of children today, the consequences of continued and unchecked/uncheckable global human population growth comes more readily to mind. How we have arrived at a point where people can consider the over-representation of pink in little girls' wardrobes to be a crisis is baffling to me. For an intelligent species we have some tiny, tiny minds...   Steve, Winchester, UK I'm female and was born just after the end of WWII. I was often dressed in blue and my younger sister was often dressed in pink. Why? I have no idea, other than I was fair-haired and my sister had dark hair. Perhaps due to the austerities of the war, that was what was available at the time. Now I have the choice of which colours to wear, and I prefer reds and pinks, although I do wear blue as well. I don't think I have been harmed at all. Whatever next! Will someone suggest that we have too much green in nature?   Lesley, Sevenoaks I've always hated pink, it feels for me to have suggestions of fluffy, silly, girliness which doesn't suit my personality. My three-year-old daughter is very similar - her favourite colour is blue and she loves Thomas the Tank Engine, but I have no choice but to dress her in pink clothes, particularly on a restricted budget. Colour is an important expression of personality, and this is being restricted for girls. However, I don't think this ultimately affects their success or career choice, but I could be wrong.   Emma Carter, Bicester Sue Palmer claims that an obsession with Pink stunts a girls' personality. Surely, not allowing a child, whatever sex, the freedom to express their likes and dislikes re colour can only harm them more? I have two daughters (13 & 16) who have been in and out of love with the whole rainbow of colours and I'm happy to report that they are both extremely well-adjusted young ladies, with no personality problems at all.    Samm Dodge, Bishops Stortford, UK This pattern is in nature. When starlings are ready to find a mate, the base of their bill changes colour - males have a blue tinge and females have a pink tinge. Perhaps it's a natural choice? Just to confuse things... my favourite colour has always been aquamarine and I'm female.   Lesley, Hitchin My partner and I have a one-year-old daughter, who we attempt to dress in other colours. When she was born we received lots of clothes, unsurprisingly in pink. We reached our threshold when someone gave us a dozen different outfits for her first Christmas but all in the same sugar pink. After that we consciously dressed her in other colours, only to have people assume she was a boy even though she would be wearing a dress. The public in general assign pink to girls and some people appear to be confused if they do not see a girl baby dressed in that colour.   Marnie, Newport, South Wales Our eldest daugher, five, is all about pink, and has been for years. This is despite our conscious efforts to not force pinkness on her. Conversely our other daughter, three - who is surrounded by her sister's clothes etc - shows no particular interest in pink; she's more likely to go for yellow.   Andy, Brighton, UK Two of my friends have recently given birth to baby girls and whilst I don't have a problem with a bit of pink here and there, I do object to this ""Daddy's little princess"" culture that seems to go hand in hand with the colour. Combine this with the quite sexual nature of some clothes aimed at the under-10s, and the proliferation of Playboy merchandise that is also pink and fluffy, and you can end up with a dangerous message of objectification from an early age.   Laura, London Please! The pink issue is no different to girls just playing with dolls, boys being given cars and guns. Surely the idea is to provide a balance? Small children, given the right opportunities to become familiar with other colours, toys, experiences will have their own ideas as they grow up in society. For goodness sake be concerned about child cruelty and other serious issues for children. Pink obsessionism is rather frivolous.   Sue Sandham, Magor, Caldicot I'm sorry but girls liking pink is genetic. My niece loved the colour pretty much from birth and by no means had it been forced upon her. Little girls are girly, genetically, they are hard-wired to be so. End of story.   Sam Sam, colour preference is not hard-wired, what a silly thing to say, especially based on a sample size of one. I worry that children can't express themselves by wearing whatever colour they like. The large companies keep trying to pigeonhole everyone or ad agencies or even government agencies. We are individuals, adults and children and need to be treated as such.   Louise, Lincoln, UK I wish shops wouldn't always just do stuff in pink. My daughter won't wear ANYTHING pink or even with a bit of pink on it, hasn't in years. This makes buying most things VERY difficult especially as she's young. PLEASE more colours. I think this is her way of saying enough pink.   S Edwards, Bristol My beautiful baby daughter aged three months looks stunning in pink, despite the best efforts of me and my wife to avoid dressing her in the colour.

548,"Christopher Dell had inadvertently walked into a poorly marked military area while walking in Harare's National Botanical Gardens, the US embassy said.  A Zimbabwe presidential spokesman said Mr Dell was lucky to be alive.  Zimbabwe's foreign ministry said Mr Dell had shown ""flagrant disregard"" for Zimbabwe's security laws.  ""The American ambassador must consider himself very lucky that he is dealing with a professional army that the Zimbabwean national army is,"" presidential spokesman George Charamba told the state-run Herald newspaper.  ""Elsewhere, and definitely in America, he would have been a dead man.""  The Herald said Mr Dell had been arrested by a special presidential army unit when he entered a restricted zone in the botanical gardens, near President Robert Mugabe's official residence.  The Zimbabwean ministry of foreign affairs has protested to the US embassy about the incident, which took place on Monday afternoon.  ""Such action was taken in a calculated disregard of the rules governing relations between states and was clearly intended to provoke an unwarranted diplomatic incident,"" it added.  The US mission said two senior Zimbabwean government officials had apologised for Mr Dell's detention and that it considered the matter closed.

650,"Benn: I come for one reason only - to see whether in a talk we can explore, or you can help me to see, what the paths to peace may be.  My only reason, I remember the war because I lost a brother. I never want to see another war.  There are millions of people all over the world who don't want a war, and by agreeing to this interview, which is very historic for all of us, I hope you will be able to help me be able to say something to the world that is significant and positive.  Saddam: Welcome to Baghdad. You are conscious of the role that Iraqis have set out for themselves, inspired by their own culture, their civilisation and their role in human history.  This role requires peace in order to prosper and progress. Having said that, the Iraqis are committed to their rights as much as they are committed to the rights of others.  Without peace they will be faced with many obstacles that would stop them from fulfilling their human role.  Benn: Mr President, may I ask you some questions. The first is, does Iraq have any weapons of mass destruction?  Saddam: Most Iraqi officials have been in power for over 34 years and have experience of dealing with the outside world.  Every fair-minded person knows that when Iraqi officials say something, they are trustworthy.  A few minutes ago when you asked me if I wanted to look at the questions beforehand I told you I didn't feel the need so that we don't waste time, and I gave you the freedom to ask me any question directly so that my reply would be direct.  This is an opportunity to reach the British people and the forces of peace in the world.  There is only one truth and therefore I tell you as I have said on many occasions before that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction whatsoever.  We challenge anyone who claims that we have to bring forward any evidence and present it to public opinion.  Benn: I have another which has been raised: Do you have links with al-Qaeda?  Saddam: If we had a relationship with al-Qaeda and we believed in that relationship we wouldn't be ashamed to admit it. Therefore I would like to tell you directly and also through you to anyone who is interested to know that we have no relationship with al-Qaeda.  Benn: In relation to the inspectors, there appears to be difficulties with inspectors, and I wonder whether there's anything you can tell me about these difficulties and whether you believe they will be cleared up before Mr Hans Blix and Mr ElBaradei come back to Baghdad?  Saddam: You are aware that every major event must encounter some difficulty.  On the subject of the inspectors and the resolutions that deal with Iraq you must have been following it and you must have a view and a vision as to whether these resolutions have any basis in international law.  Nevertheless the Security Council produced them. These resolutions - implemented or not - or the motivation behind these resolutions could lead the current situation to the path of peace or war. Therefore it's a critical situation.  Let us also remember the unjust suffering of the Iraqi people. For the last 13 years since the blockade was imposed, you must be aware of the amount of harm that it has caused the Iraqi people, particularly the children and the elderly, as a result of the shortage of food and medicine and other aspects of their life.  Therefore we are facing a critical situation.  On that basis, it is not surprising that there might be complaints relating to the small details of the inspection which may be essential issues as far as we are concerned and the way we see the whole thing. It is possible that those Iraqis who are involved with the inspection might complain about the conduct of the inspectors and they complain indeed.  It is also possible that some inspectors either for reasons of practical and detailed procedure, or for some other motives, may complain about the Iraqi conduct.  Every fair-minded person knows that as far as resolution 1441 is concerned, the Iraqis have been fulfilling their obligations under the resolution.  When Iraq objects to the conduct of those implementing the Security Council resolutions, that doesn't mean that Iraq wishes to push things to confrontation.  Iraq has no interest in war. No Iraqi official or ordinary citizen has expressed a wish to go to war.  The question should be directed at the other side. Are they looking for a pretext so they could justify war against Iraq?  If the purpose was to make sure that Iraq is free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons then they can do that. These weapons do not come in small pills that you can hide in your pocket.  These are weapons of mass destruction and it is easy to work out if Iraq has them or not. We have said many times before and we say it again today that Iraq is free of such weapons.  So when Iraq objects to the conduct of the inspection teams or others, that doesn't mean that Iraq is interested in putting obstacles before them which could hinder the efforts to get to the truth.  It is in our interest to facilitate their mission to find the truth.  The question is does the other side want to get to the same conclusion or are they looking for a pretext for aggression? If those concerned prefer aggression then it's within their reach.  The super powers can create a pretext any day to claim that Iraq is not implementing resolution 1441.  They have claimed before that Iraq did not implement the previous resolutions.  However, after many years it became clear that Iraq had complied with these resolutions. Otherwise, why are they focusing now on the latest resolution and not the previous ones?  Benn: May I broaden the question out, Mr President, to the relations between Iraq and the UN, and the prospects for peace more broadly, and I wonder whether with all its weaknesses and all the difficulties, whether you see a way in which the UN can reach that objective for the benefit of humanity?  Saddam: The point you raised can be found in the United Nations charter. As you know Iraq is one of the founders and first signatories of the charter.  If we look at the representatives of two super powers - America and Britain - and look at their conduct and their language, we would notice that they are more motivated by war than their responsibility for peace.  And when they talk about peace all they do is accuse others they wish to destroy in the name of peace.  They claim they are looking after the interests of their people. You know as well as I do that this is not the truth.  Yes the world would respect this principle if it was genuinely applied.  It's not about power but it is about right and wrong, about when we base our human relations on good, and respect this principle.  So it becomes simple to adhere to this principle because anyone who violates it will be exposed to public opinion.  Benn: There are people who believe this present conflict is about oil, and I wonder if you would say something about how you see the enormous oil reserves of Iraq being developed, first for the benefit of the people of Iraq and secondly for the needs of mankind.  Saddam: When we speak about oil in this part of the world - we are an integral part of the world - we have to deal with others in all aspects of life, economic as well as social, technical, scientific and other areas.  It seems that the authorities in the US are motivated by aggression that has been evident for more than a decade against the region.  The first factor is the role of those influential people in the decision taken by the president of the US based on sympathy with the Zionist entity that was created at the expense of Palestine and its people and their humanity.  These people force the hand of the American administration by claiming that the Arabs pose a danger to Israel, without remembering their obligation to God and how the Palestinian people were driven out of their homeland.  The consecutive American administrations were led down a path of hostility against the people of this region, including our own nation and we are part of it.  Those people and others have been telling the various US administrations, especially the current one, that if you want to control the world you need to control the oil.  Therefore the destruction of Iraq is a pre-requisite to controlling oil. That means the destruction of the Iraqi national identity, since the Iraqis are committed to their principles and rights according to international law and the UN charter.  It seems that this argument has appealed to some US administrations especially the current one that if they control the oil in the Middle East, they would be able to control the world. They could dictate to China the size of its economic growth and interfere in its education system and could do the same to Germany and France and perhaps to Russia and Japan.  They might even tell the same to Britain if its oil doesn't satisfy its domestic consumption.  It seems to me that this hostility is a trademark of the current US administration and is based on its wish to control the world and spread its hegemony.  People have the right to say that if this aggression by the American administration continues, it would lead to widespread enmity and resistance.  We won't be able to develop the oil fields or the oil industry and therefore create worldwide co-operation as members of the human family when there is war, destruction and death.  Isn't it reasonable to question this approach and conclude that this road will not benefit anyone including America or its people?  It may serve some short-term interests or the interests of some influential powers in the US but we can't claim that it serves the interest of the American people in the long run or other nations.  Benn: There are tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people in Britain and America, in Europe and worldwide, who want to see a peaceful outcome to this problem, and they are the real Americans in my opinion, the real British, the real French, the real Germans, because they think of the world in terms of their children.  I have 10 grandchildren and in my family there is English, Scottish, American, French, Irish, Jewish, Indian, Muslim blood, and for me politics is about their future, their survival.  And I wonder whether you could say something yourself directly through this interview to the peace movement of the world that might help to advance the cause they have in mind?  Saddam: First of all we admire the development of the peace movement around the world in the last few years.  We pray to God to empower all those working against war and for the cause of peace and security based on just peace for all.  And through you we say to the British people that Iraqis do not hate the British people.  Before 1991 Iraq and Britain had a normal relationship as well as normal relations with America.  At that time the British governments had no reason to criticise Iraq as we hear some voices doing these days.  We hope the British people would tell those who hate the Iraqis and wish them harm that there is no reason to justify this war and please tell them that I say to you because the British people are brave - tell them that the Iraqis are brave too.  Tell the British people if the Iraqis are subjected to aggression or humiliation they would fight bravely.  Just as the British people did in the Second World War and we will defend our country as they defended their country each in its own way.  The Iraqis don't wish war but if war is imposed upon them - if they are attacked and insulted - they will defend themselves. They will defend their country, their sovereignty and their security.  We will not disappoint those who believe in the principles of justice.  And we will uphold the principles of justice and right that we strongly believe in."
651,"The star of the Jonathan Creek television series - Alan Davies - has admitted being bullied at school made him depressed and even prompted him to shoplift. Supporting the launch of the Department for Education's new bullying guidelines for schools, Davies recalled his experiences of being bullied at the independent Bancroft School in Woodford Green, Essex.    I got quite depressed and became a proficient shoplifter    ""I suffered at the hands of some older boys for a few weeks. They thought it would be fun to trip you up, yank your tie, call you names,"" he said. ""I got quite depressed and became a proficient shoplifter, which filled the time. ""I made quite a good living - I would pinch things then flog them to the other kids,"" he joked. Davies said he was unhappy throughout secondary school years and his education had suffered as a result. ""It wasn't until I went to a further education college that I got back on track,"" the actor said. ""I do know what it's like to be very unhappy as a child because of bullying and there is no framework to deal with it - you don't tell anyone, that's the whole point."" Pupils at his school were considered ""posh"" by other schoolchildren in the area, he added, which led to bullying outside of school. Speaking in a DfEE video - which forms part of the Don't suffer in silence campaign - Davies tells how losing his mother at the age of six made him feel different to his friends. ""There was an atmosphere of relentless mickey-taking - just non-stop. ""You were almost afraid to move sometimes and someone would say some deeply sarcastic comments at your expense."" Bullies are people who feel powerless themselves and who want to have some effect on the world, he reminds pupils. ""If they can have influence over some kid's behaviour everyday, it gives them a sense of power."" Also featured in the anti-bullying video is Blackadder's Baldrick - Tony Robinson. Robinson believes he was targeted by bullies because he was smaller and ""weedier"" than the other children and was also short-sighted. ""Not only was I specky-four eyes, I had those teeth which stick out as well."" The video is fronted by Patsy Palmer, who played Bianca in the BBC soap, Eastenders. ""It's really hurtful and it makes the people being bullied feel miserable and alone - especially if they suffer in silence. ""I should know because I was bullied at school myself."" She urges pupils not to put up with bullying and to speak out against it. The revised education pack for schools was launched on Wednesday at a conference organised by Family Service Units. The Education Secretary, David Blunkett said: ""The message needs to go loud and clear to the bullies: bullying is unacceptable, it won't earn you respect. ""For those who are bullied and their friends the message is simple - tell someone, don't suffer in silence."" BBC News Online is hosting a forum with strongman ""Big Dave"" Gauder, who was bullied when younger and who now tours schools talking to children about the problem. He will be answering your questions on Thursday."
652,"Richard Haigh, principal of Coombeshead College, Newton Abbot, Devon, has criticised ""hysterical"" stereotyping of 'hoodie' wearers as thugs.  ""Most young people are fine, upstanding citizens, and some of them wear hoodies. Why should they be tarred with this rather hysterical brush?"" he said.  This was part of a new code of conduct for visitors aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour at the complex.  ""It's the behaviour that's the problem, not the clothing,"" Mr Haigh said on Thursday.  He added: ""If you know how young people's minds work, the best way of encouraging them to do something is to ban it.  Hooded tops have been part of the uniform at Coombeshead College, a 1,600-strong media and arts college, for two years.  Between 10 and 15% of students wear them, the headmaster estimated.  They are only allowed to put up the hoods when it is raining.  In a letter that he described as ""tongue in cheek"" to the Times on Wednesday, Mr Haigh wrote: ""I am disappointed by the lack of subtlety in dealing with the hoodie problem.  ""Follow our example and make them part of school uniform. How uncool does that make them?"""
653,"For Steve Norris, who ran Ken Livingstone a far closer race than expected, it had been the case of third time lucky.  His route to become the Tory candidate for London mayor became as dogged as anything Mr Livingstone had to face, although at the end of the day, Norris was at least able to say he had been elected on a one member, one vote basis.  Late last year Norris was beaten to become the Conservatives' mayoral candidate by the millionaire author Lord Archer.  But when Archer was forced to resign after the tabloid revelation that he had asked a friend to lie for him prior to a libel case, Norris was given another chance to become the Tory candidate.  Many assumed the nomination would automatically go to Norris, whose previous role as minister for transport in London appeared to make him an obvious choice.  Instead the party decided to restage the contest and Norris had to reapply, only to be almost blocked from the party's shortlist over concerns surrounding his colourful private life.  Conservative chairman Michael Ancram had to wade into the row and reinstate Norris, overriding the original decision by the party's mayoral executive to block him.  But the incident unearthed a groundswell of support for Norris, who finally became the party's candidate in January.  Like Frank Dobson, Norris is not a Londoner by birth, though he has adopted the city as his home.  He was born in Liverpool in 1945, educated at the same grammar school as Paul McCartney and George Harrison and then at Oxford.  Instead of following a career in the law, which he studied, he went into the motor trade and became a franchise-holder for Volkswagen and Audi in the 70s and 80s.  Norris had been in the Labour club at Oxford but it was as a Tory councillor that he entered politics when he was elected on to Berkshire County Council in 1977.  Five years later, he was selected from 200 applicants to stand for the Oxford East seat which he won in 1983 and held until 1987 when he became the only Tory to lose his seat in the south of England, to the current chief secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Smith.  Norris was considered for numerous by-elections the following year, including the Richmond contest which elected William Hague, and eventually won the seat of Epping Forest.  During his time in Parliament, he served as the parliamentary private secretary to three ministers before being appointed as a junior minister for transport in London in 1992.  He was then promoted in 1994 to minister for local transport and road safety but stood down at the 1997 general election in preference of earning some ""serious money"" and became director general of the Road Haulage Association.  It was a position which maintained him in the spotlight until he stood down to concentrate on the mayoral battle, although he does remain a director of a number of transport-related companies.  Norris is as candid about the reasons he left Parliament as he is about how he lost his cash made from his dealerships during the recession a decade ago.  Similarly, he is also open about the relationships with five ""mistresses"" exposed by the tabloids during the ""back to basics"" era which earned him the nickname of ""Shagger"", although he insisted the affairs stretched over 25 years.  He has two sons by his first wife Vicky, whom he married in 1969, and another son with his current wife, Emma, whom he married last month.  Norris lives in Clapham, south London, and despite his Liverpool roots, is someone who has chosen London as his adopted city - illustrated by the fact that though an Everton fan by birth, he is now a Fulham season ticket holder.  As an MP, he supported the death penalty, football identity cards, the Poll Tax, student loans and has described commuters as ""dreadful human beings"".  But his mayoral battle was fought on a more liberal social agenda.  Labelled the Tory candidate that ""dare not speak"" the party's name by his opponents, Norris stood for the repeal of Section 28 and a London which reflected and catered for its ethnic minority population.  He also called for the consideration of cannabis to be used in the treatment of medical complaints and called for police to overlook the law against ""'discreet public sex"" between homosexuals.  Many have enjoyed the return of one of the Tories' most affable warhorses back to the spotlight and despite being unable to become London's first directly elected mayor, it is unlikely Norris will remain out of the public eye for very long."
654,"The first known examples of writing may have been unearthed at an archaeological dig in Pakistan.  So-called 'plant-like' and 'trident-shaped' markings have been found on fragments of pottery dating back 5500 years.  Harappa was originally a small settlement in 3500 BC but by 2600 BC it had developed into a major urban centre.  According to Dr Richard Meadow of Harvard University, the director of the Harappa Archaeological Research Project, these primitive inscriptions found on pottery may pre-date all other known writing.  Last year it was suggested that the oldest writing might have come from Egypt.  Clay tablets containing primitive words were uncovered in southern Egypt at the tomb of a king named Scorpion.  They were carbon-dated to 3300-3200 BC. This is about the same time, or slightly earlier, to the primitive writing developed by the Sumerians of the Mesopotamian civilisation around 3100 BC.  ""It's a big question as to if we can call what we have found true writing,"" he told BBC News Online, ""but we have found symbols that have similarities to what became Indus script.  One major problem in determining what the symbols mean is that no one understands the Indus language. It was unique and is now dead.  Dr Meadow points out that nothing similar to the 'Rosetta Stone' exists for the Harappan text.  The Rosetta Stone, housed in the British museum since 1802, is a large slab of black basalt uniquely inscribed with the same text in both Egyptian hieroglyphs and Greek.  Its discovery allowed researchers to decipher the ancient Egyptian script for the first time.  The Harappan language died out and did not form the basis of other languages.  What historians know of the Harappan civilisation makes them unique. Their society did not like great differences between social classes or the display of wealth by rulers. They did not leave behind large monuments or rich graves.  They appear to be a peaceful people who displayed their art in smaller works of stone.  Their society seems to have petered out. Around 1900 BC Harappa and other urban centres started to decline as people left them to move east to what is now India and the Ganges.  This discovery will add to the debate about the origins of the written word.  It probably suggests that writing developed independently in at least three places - Egypt, Mesopotamia and Harappa between 3500 BC and 3100 BC."
655,"The 11-year-old, of Adambrae in Livingston, disappeared after being dropped off for school on Thursday.  A post-mortem examination is now being carried out in an attempt to determine the cause of his death.  The community expressed its grief following the discovery of his body on Sunday afternoon, with flowers being laid at the entrance to the woods.  Officers said Rory's death was being treated as suspicious, which is standard procedure when a body is found in the open air.  He had not been seen since his mother Michelle dropped him off near Meldrum Primary in the Deans area of the town at about 0830 BST on Thursday.  The alarm was raised on Thursday afternoon when Rory's grandfather went to collect him from school and it was found he had not been in classes all day.  A search was launched and escalated over the weekend as fears for his safety grew.  His body was found just before 1300 BST on Sunday in woods at the western end of Dechmont Law, between the M8 and Meldrum Primary. Forensic teams have continued to examine the area.  Chief Inspector Jim Thomson, who led the search for Rory, said his thoughts were with the boy's family.  He said there had been a ""fantastic response"" from people who wanted to help with the search.  ""Over the weekend we had nearly 300 members of the public helping us with the search in addition to the 70 trained mountain search and rescue teams and specialist police officers,"" he said.  ""This shows the strength of community spirit in the area and how much everyone has been affected by recent events.""  Police were at Meldrum Primary on Monday to talk to parents about whether they remember anything unusual about last Thursday morning.  Officers have also been stationed at the town's other primary schools to offer reassurance.  The parents taking their children to Meldrum Primary on Monday included 37-year-old mother-of-two Karen Carroll.  She said: ""My son normally walks to school as we live close by but obviously that's changed at the moment.  ""I'll take him there and back - that's the safest thing to do, I think.""  Deacon Glenda Wilson, of Livingston Ecumenical Parish, said: ""The clergy and all the people of the Livingston churches had been hoping and praying that Rory would be found safe and well.  ""The whole community has been greatly saddened by the news.""  The people who laid flowers at the entrance to the woods included 38-year-old Brian McPhillie, who said: ""It is just a tragedy what has happened.  ""Everyone is emotional. We've just been to the primary school and the kids are out in the playground but they are not playing. It is very sad."""
656,"And there was a double boost for the German after his team-mate Eddie Irvine also forced his way ahead of Hakkinen's McLaren.  Irvine was second at one stage, before dropping back to fourth.  But there was disappointment for Finland's Hakkinen, who had to settle for fifth place, with fellow McLaren driver David Coulthard in sixth place.  Hakkinen will win the championship if he finishes second in Sunday's race, even if Schumacher triumphs.  Schumacher gained the early psychological advantage after five weeks of intensive build-up to the title decider.  Hakkinen led at the end of the first session, but he was just 0.074sec ahead of his German rival, who chose to spend much of the first session discussing tactics with his team.  But after the break the double champion raced to the top of the standings.  And Schumacher then bettered his time, clocking a fastest lap of one minute 39.823 seconds.  Northern Ireland's Irvine also impressed, before suffering a setback when he lost the back end of the Frerrari at a right-handed corner late in the session and slid into a gravel trap.  Jordan's Damon Hill clocked the seventh fastest time and Johnny Herbert was 18th in his Sauber in his last race before joining Stewart Ford."
657,"The deal was done in early September and for their money the new owner got a level 70 night elf rogue called Zeuzo.  The price was so high because Zeuzo possessed magical items, including the twin Warglaives of Azzinoth, owned by only a handful of Warcraft's nine million active players.  The powerful items were gained by the character's original owner completing some of the most challenging parts of the game.  World of Warcraft is an online fantasy world in which players create characters and take them adventuring. The characters gain experience and become more powerful by doing all sorts of quests (kill this, find that, deliver this).  At the higher levels many players band together to go on raids to kill the most powerful enemies and get the best loot.  Zeuzo's creator, who took the rogue from level zero to high level hero, was contacted for the BBC by other players but he would not confirm or deny reports of the sale.  The Method guild of which Zeuzo was a member also declined to comment on the the sale.  However, the BBC does have independent confirmation that the account was sold for a figure of about 7,000 euros.  Some Warcraft players who know Zeuzo's creator did speak out.  On condition of anonymity one said: ""The trade was simple. It was a case of the buyer finding out that Zeuzo was currently the best geared rogue in game.""  He said Method was disappointed to lose such a good character, but at the same time, understood the final decision.  Oliver Koppany, a fellow player chosen by Zeuzo as a ""spokesperson"" added: ""He had been undergoing financial hardship and that was the only reason why he sold the account.""  The new owner moved the valuable rogue to another server and re-named it Shaks.  Bill Vaughan, editor of IncGame's World of Warcraft website, said many people bought accounts to get over the grind of taking a character to the highest levels of the game.  ""It generally takes an average person anything up to 600 game play hours to reach the current highest level,"" said Ms Vaughan.  Account selling is a growing phenomenon and the average price currently hovers around the £200 mark.  ""The problem is,"" said Ms Vaughan, ""you have no idea how to play the character properly.""  ""Within a short space of time, you would be subject to the embarrassment of other players noticing your lack of skills, and it would be very apparent that you had either bought your account, or had paid to have your character levelled,"" she said.  But, said Ms Vaughan, worse than other players noticing someone has bought their account is catching the attention of Warcraft creator Blizzard. Selling accounts and in-game items is against the terms and conditions people sign up to when they start playing.  Blizzard has banned up to 100,000 accounts in a month for illegal gold trading or cheating in the game. In a statement the company said it took the action: ""to promote a fun and fair environment for all our players.""  ""Account sales can sometimes be hard to detect, depending on the technology that a game company uses to gather information about users,"" he added.  In this case Blizzard caught on quick. It banned the account about five days after it was sold.  While account selling is controversial among Warcraft players, for some it has become a business prospect.  ""Account selling is a ludicrous business indeed. I have friends who make good money without moving one finger,"" the BBC was told by one player. ""You can earn 200 euros without doing absolutely anything.""  He said many buy a new account for 12 euros, then pay a gold farmer to power-level the character in 20 days and then when it had reached level 70 sell it back for 400 euros.  Dee Patel, an ex-Warcraft player and a game industry professional, admitted having sold his account for £650 on eBay.  ""I could have been offered a lot more for my account but I was just wanting to stop playing and wanted to get rid of it,"" he said.  Last January, eBay banned on-line games account selling on its website. But thousands of other sites offer similar auction services.  Globally the business is huge. Edward Castronova, an academic studying the economics of online gaming at the University of Indiana, estimates that the real money trade - people paying real cash for virtual items - is worth around $300-$400m."
658,"A married father-of-four faces a life behind bars for a series of horrific rapes and murders.  The Old Bailey jury found David Mulcahy guilty of the rape and murder of three women, seven more rapes and five counts of conspiracy to rape.  The court had heard that Mulcahy had ""hunted"" women in and around London with his childhood friend John Duffy - the so-called ""railway rapist"", now serving life imprisonment for rape and murder.  Mulcahy, a 41-year-old builder of Chalk Farm, north London, had planned a number of the attacks in the 1980s with his ""wicked soulmate"", the jury heard. As youths Duffy and Mulcahy used to go out shooting at people with air rifles. Their friendship continued after they both got married and used to go out together at weekends. Giving evidence in Mulcahy's trial, Duffy said: ""We would plan it quite meticulously. ""We would have balaclavas and knives. We used to call it hunting. We did it as a bit of a joke. A bit of a game."" In July 1984 the pair raped two girls on Hampstead Heath.  ""We were very excited we had two victims. We thought it was great really,"" said Duffy. He said the two men had laughed about the rapes afterwards while listening to Michael Jackson tapes. In 1985, the pair turned to murder. Alison Day, was just 19 years old when she was raped and strangled at Hackney Wick station, east London, in December 1985. The following April, schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer, 15, was attacked by the men as she went to the shops to buy sweets. She too was raped and strangled near her home in Horsley, Surrey.  A month later in May 1986, newly-married TV presenter Anne Lock, 29, was killed by Mulcahy - probably suffocated - as she returned to her home at Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire. John Duffy, 41, was jailed for life in 1988 for two of the murders but cleared of killing Anne Lock. He had attacked more than 20 women - most aged between 15 and 32 - at railway stations in and around London and became known as the ""railway rapist"". Mulcahy's part in the appalling crimes was only revealed by Duffy while in prison."
659,"The Hutton Inquiry found he died as a result of a slit wrist in July 2003.  But the medics said the small amount of blood they saw around the body was inconsistent with the cut on his wrist being the cause of death.  They spoke to the inquiry and Thames Valley Police, who say the investigation will not be reopened.  The scientist killed himself after being named as the possible source of a BBC story.  The story, which claimed that the government had ""sexed-up"" a dossier on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, led to the weapons inspector being subjected to intense pressure.  The pair gave a press conference after renewed media interest was sparked by the article.  Fellow paramedic Dave Bartlett said: ""Everyone was surprised at the outcome [of the Hutton Inquiry].  ""I would have thought there would have been more blood over the body if someone had bled to death.""  He added that the pair's observations of the scene ""were inconsistent with the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry"".  ""We stress that is our personal opinion. We do not represent the views of any body or group.""  Explaining her belief that the wound on Dr Kelly's wrist did not cause his death, Ms Hunt said: ""There just wasn't a lot of blood.  ""When someone cuts an artery, whether accidentally or intentionally, the blood pumps everywhere.""  The pair are not the only ones to question the inquiry's findings.  A team of scientists calling themselves the Kelly Investigation Group also believe there would have been much more blood at the scene.  But Dr Bob Van Hegan, a consultant pathologist, disagrees with the paramedics' assessment.  He told Sky News that in addition to the wrist wound there were three further factors which could have contributed to the scientist's death.  Dr Van Hegan pointed out that Dr Kelly's coronary arteries were in a poor condition, he suffered from a vascular disease and he had taken an opiate drug.  Tom Mangold, a former BBC journalist and friend of Dr Kelly, said: ""The fact that the paramedics did not find sufficient blood does not mean that it was not spilt.  ""Although I am sure they are speaking in good faith there is no doubt in my mind, or anyone else connected with the case, that David committed suicide.""  In March Oxfordshire coroner Nicholas Gardiner decided not to reconvene the inquest into Dr Kelly's death after it was adjourned while Lord Hutton held his inquiry.  The inquiry, which concluded that the weapons expert committed suicide, was deemed to remove the need for a full inquest.  A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said on Sunday: ""[We] are fully satisfied with the outcome of the investigation into David Kelly's death. """
660,"Head of the Muslim Council of Britain Sir Iqbal Sacranie said introducing the partnerships did ""not augur well"" for building the foundations of society.  Nevertheless, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme, everyone should be tolerant.  Peter Tatchell of gay rights group OutRage! said: ""It is tragic for one minority to attack another minority.""  Sir Iqbal said of civil partnerships: ""This is harmful.  ""It does not augur well in building the very foundations of society - stability, family relationships. And it is something we would certainly not, in any form, encourage the community to be involved in.""  He said he was guided by the teachings of the Muslim faith, adding that other religions such as Christianity and Judaism held the same stance.  Asked if he believed homosexuality was harmful to society, he said: ""Certainly it is a practice that in terms of health, in terms of the moral issues that comes along in a society - it is. It is not acceptable.""  ""Each of our faiths tells us that it is harmful and I think, if you look into the scientific evidence that has been available in terms of the forms of various other illnesses and diseases that are there, surely it points out that where homosexuality is practised there is a greater concern in that area.""  He said everyone in society should be tolerant, and if they are not happy then engage in the democratic processes to give their views.  ""We may not be happy with the views being expressed by others. But the difficulty comes in that at the end of the day we are human beings.""  He said both the opponents and supporters of civil partnerships had the right to speak out.  Mr Tatchell, the founder of OutRage!, added: ""Both the Muslim and gay communities suffer prejudice and discrimination. We should stand together to fight Islamophobia and homophobia."""
661,"The ""extra lane"" scheme will be rolled out on the M6 near Birmingham following a successful trial on the nearby M42.  It aims to ease rush-hour bottlenecks, and could be extended to other motorways in the future.  Sensors detect traffic build-up, which trigger signs asking drivers to slow down and spread out.  During the trial, a 50mph speed limit was imposed while the ""extra lanes"" were in operation.  The report on the M42 trial has shown a reduction in journey times north by up to 25% and a drop in the average accident rate from 5.2 per month to 1.5.  The report also found there had been a drop in pollution around the M42, with fuel consumption down by 4% and vehicle emissions down by 10%.  But Tony Bosworth, from Friends of the Earth (FoE), disagreed there were environmental benefits: ""It's effectively motorway widening on the cheap.  ""We believe it's simply going to encourage more drivers and cause an increase in carbon dioxide.""  Ms Kelly said ""extra lanes"" would be introduced on the M6 between junctions 4 and 5 near the Birmingham NEC arena, and junctions 8 and 10A between the M5 link and the M54 motorway junction.  The expansion will cost £150m and is due to be completed by 2011.  The government is also launching a feasibility study to consider including the M1, M25, M4 and M20 in the future.  The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) said it had reservations about the changes when they were first introduced on the M42, near Birmingham.  Kevin Clinton, from RoSPA, said: ""We were concerned that if the hard shoulder is used as a running lane, if there was a major crash it may take the emergency services longer to get there.  ""Or when someone breaks down, they may not be able to get their vehicle out of the running lane.""  But Graham Bowskill, from the Highways Agency, told the BBC that the hard shoulder would not be opened to traffic if there was a broken down vehicle on it.  ""We do actually have cameras that are constantly monitoring to see whether there are any parked vehicles,"" Mr Bowskill said.  ""At the same time, we've built additional safety features into the scheme.  ""There are emergency refuges approximately every 500 metres along this section of motorway and that's where people can park safely if they break down.""  Ms Kelly said the M42 trial had been ""really impressive"", adding: ""People get from their front door to their place of work in a much more reliable time frame.  ""The safety fears that some people have haven't materialised at all and, not only that, it's good for the economy and the environment too.""  Rebecca Lush Blum, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said the success of the M42 trial in cutting congestion showed motorway widening schemes were ""very hard to justify"".  ""But managing traffic is not enough - we need to reduce it,"" she said.  ""In allowing for increased traffic levels, active traffic management ignores the real, pressing problem of too much traffic and rising C02 levels.""  Paul Watters, head of roads policy at the AA, said the M42 trial appeared to be working well although it had so far not been tested by a major incident.  ""It's a much more comfortable experience [for drivers]. They travel slower, but get to their journey destination quicker,"" he said.  Mr Watters said his organisation backed the expansion if it was done ""for the right reasons and in the right manner"".  ""We wouldn't support just taking the hard shoulder away.""  And he added: ""There is a risk that rolling it out nationally there could be skimping which would be counter-productive and even dangerous.""  The use of variable speed limits will be introduced on the M40 between junctions 16 and 3A and where it joins the M42 south of Birmingham.  Variable speed limits currently in operation on the M42 will be extended north to junction 9.  Geoff Dossetter, from the Freight Transport Association, said lorry drivers wanted to see motorways widened and new roads built, but the hard shoulder scheme was ""a sensible way of making the most of the roads network that we already have"".  ""It has made an important contribution to improving journey time reliability for commercial vehicle operators,"" Mr Dossetter added.  ""Replicating the scheme elsewhere - and quickly - clearly makes sense."""
662,"By the BBC's Charles Rhodes Kings and queens loved them, as did prime ministers. The Humber motor car was once the favourite limousine of the aristocracy and ruling classes. After the Second World War, King George VI ordered 47 to be sent to British embassies and consulates around the world for royal tours. These days this classic car has been largely forgotten, but now a potato merchant from Hull hopes to change that with a museum dedicated to the Humber. Alan Marshall inherited his love of Humbers from his father, who drove them as army staff cars during the war. After learning to drive in a Humber, Alan now has 41, the largest collection in the world, and wants help from Kingston upon Hull City Council to open a museum dedicated to what he believes is one of Britain's greatest cars. He says: ""There seems to be a great deal of nostalgia for the Humber. There was the Great in Britain when this type of car was being made."" While around 80% of Rolls Royces have survived, the car that became know as the ""poor man's Rolls"" because it cost less than half as much as its more prestigious rival, has fared less well. Fewer than one in every 100 Humbers made it into the 21st Century. Many of the survivors have made it to the unlikely surroundings of Mr Marshall's potato warehouse in Hull. Here they are lovingly restored to former glories, made roadworthy and hired out for weddings. Alan Marshall loves them all, claiming he could sit in anyone of them blindfolded and recall its registration number. Among his favourites, a car once used by the Queen Mother to go to Church. According to Alan, who has its MoT records, the car travelled just seven miles in one year. It is fitting that Alan wants to open a museum in Hull - Thomas Humber who started the company was educated in the city. A bicycle in 1868 first carried the Humber badge, before Thomas Humber turned his attentions to cars in 1896, building limousines for those who preferred understated elegance to ostentatious displays of wealth. Edward VI and Wallis Simpson also liked the privacy afforded by a tiny back window on their Humber Snipe as it ferried them around London before his abdication in 1936. Found in a barn with its leather seats covered in Mildew and mice living under the floor, it is Alan Marshall's latest acquisition and after restoration, he promises it will take pride of place. Kingston upon Hull Council, which has spent £10m over the last decade on their museums, are less enthusiastic about the what a Humber museum could do for Hull. But with a new boss about to take over the museum department, the council has promised to offer any advice it can to Mr Marshall. And he is keeping his fingers crossed that the car nicknamed ""old faithful"" by its owners will at last be given the recognition he believes it deserves."
663,"A Speaker's conference is a rarely-used type of formal inquiry into the arrangements governing elections.  It is chaired by the Speaker and its membership is drawn from all of the political parties in the House of Commons.  There were five Speaker's conferences on matters to do with electoral law and electoral reform in the twentieth century, the most recent being in 1978.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown revived the practice in September 2007, announcing that a new Speaker's conference would be established to consider how to counter declining electoral turnout and boost representation of women and ethnic minorities in the House of Commons.  The first Speaker's conference, chaired by Speaker Lowther from 1916 to 1917, paved the way for the enfranchisement of women in the UK."
664,"   A £74m retail complex built on a former town centre cattle market has opened its doors. Following eight years of rows, protests and delays Carmarthen's St Catherine's Walk welcomed its first shoppers. It includes a Debenham's department store, Apollo Cinema, and a range of other shops and restaurants opening in west Wales for the first time. Centre managers hope it will make the town the region's main shopping destination. They say it will lift Carmarthen seven places in the retail ranking of shopping centres, complied by marketing property specialists CACI, to the sixth best destination in Wales. The whole town will benefit from St Catherine's Walk    Plans to develop the former cattle market site were first announced by Carmarthenshire council in 2002 with developers Simons appointed a year later. But the project was hit by delays first due to opposition to the relocation of the nearby indoor market and then to plans to close St Catherine's Street. Organisers of Friday's official opening are putting any controversy behind them with a three day programme of events and family activities to mark the occasion. Centre manager Mike Pugh said: ""It will make Carmarthen a destination town for retail and entertainment. The whole town will benefit from St Catherine's Walk."" He said he expected it would attract visitors from the neighbouring counties of Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion and reverse the drift of shoppers east to centres like Llanelli and Swansea. The centre opens in two phases on the two May bank holiday weekends. Phase one on Friday includes Debenham's, the Apollo cinema, Next, Quiksilver, Cotswold Outdoor Clothing, Vision Express, Carphone Warehouse, Costa Coffee, Pizza Express and Frankie & Benny's. Phase two opens on 31 May. Stores include River Island, New Look, TopShop, Top Man and Miss Selfridge. Mr Pugh said they were delighted that some of the names were opening in west Wales for the first time - particularly given the economic climate of the recent years. ""Retailers don't open stores without a lot of research,"" he added. He said it was a demonstration of confidence that they had in the prospects for the centre. Trading seven days a week the 245,000 sq ft centre also includes and a 950 capacity purpose built car park. It has a total of 25 units with a number still available. It is being managed by Invista Real Estate Investment Management. Carmarthenshire council chief executive Mark James said: ""Carmarthen is on the verge of exciting times and we would like to involve everyone in celebrating its future. ""This exciting development will add to the town's shopping experience and will, undoubtedly, bring many more shoppers and visitors into the area, helping to boost local businesses and the economy.""

665,"In a vanishing act echoing the film The Thomas Crown Affair, the picture was stolen from its usual position and replaced with a replica - despite a 24-hour guard in the lobby.  Staff at the men's prison discovered the theft of the picture, which depicts Christ on the cross, on Saturday morning.  The original, last valued at $175,000 back in 1985, was drawn in red and black ink for a former Corrections Department commissioner and for many years hung in the inmates' dining room.  ""It's a great mystery at this point. It looks like the painting has been replaced by a copy,"" Thomas Antenen, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, told the New York Times.  According to the New York Post, one of the prison's officers noticed that the image in the locked display case where the picture was housed ""didn't look right"".  Several more officers examined the picture and, having drawn the conclusion that something was amiss, called the police.  Investigators are baffled as to how the large painting - which measures three feet by four feet (one metre by 1.2) - could have been removed unnoticed.  In fact police are unable to even pinpoint when the painting could have been stolen and replaced by the fake, which was stapled to the back of the display case.  Nico S Yperifanos, a close friend of Dali's, who delivered the painting to Rikers Island 38 years ago, said he thought the audacious plan must have involved several people.  ""My god. It's difficult to imagine how a painting of this size would be removed from the jail. I don't know how it could have been removed intact,"" he told the New York Post.  Prisoners do not have access to the lobby, which is used only by prison personnel.  Experts have said that the painting could be worth at least three times its last estimate of $175,000.  Mr Yperifanos added that Dali, who died in 1989, would have been devastated by the theft.  Dali drew the sketch in 1965 as an apology to Anna Moscowitz Kross, the then Corrections Commissioner, after he was unable to attend a talk on art for the prisoners at Rikers because he was sick.  He dashed out the picture in just two hours and despatched Mr Yperifanos to deliver it.  On the corner he had written ""For the dinning room [sic] of the Prisoners Rikers Ysland - SD"".  And there it hung for 16 years until it was re-housed in the jail's lobby."
666,"In recent months allegations and admissions of child abuse by priests have shaken the Roman Catholic Church to its core, as a continuous stream of cases has surfaced across Western Europe and beyond. Experts say there is no evidence of a link between celibacy and abuse The Vatican has defended itself by suggesting this is a problem that affects society as a whole, and that the Church has now taken steps to deal with it - an approach that has often provoked more anger and frustration among critics who believe it systematically covered up many cases. With allegations still surfacing, there is no conclusive account of the extent of Catholic abuse worldwide or its causes. But current research and expert opinion suggest that men within the Catholic Church may be no more likely than others to abuse, and that the prevalence of abuse by priests has fallen sharply in the last 20-30 years. What has made the crisis stand out are the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way abuse was dealt with. ""The real problem is an abuse of authority, the duty of care that pastors have to their flocks,"" says the British historian, and former member of the Jesuit Catholic order, Michael Walsh. ""This has been abused and that is the greatest scandal - that's what is systemic, rather than sex abuse."" The best-known study on sex abuse by Catholic priests was published in the US, by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Commissioned by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, its main findings were published in 2004, two years after abuse cases threw the Church there into turmoil. The study established that the vast majority of known cases in the US happened decades ago, though they were only reported much more recently. There is a big gap between the reality and the public debate    Some 4% of American priests and deacons in active ministry were accused of abusing children in cases dating to the years between 1950 and 2002, the study found, with 75% of the abuses alleged to have taken place from 1960-1984. The authors of the study say they do not have data on abuse by other, comparative groups in the US - though research on the boy scouts is currently being compiled. But they stress that cases involving Catholic priests should be seen within the broader context of the widespread sexual abuse of children. ""If you think about the vast number of youth that are affected by this you have to look at this as an overall social problem of significant dimensions,"" says one of the report's researchers, Margaret Smith. In Europe, the reporting of cases has accelerated more recently, though the emerging patterns are not uniform and the picture is still patchy. In Germany, the birthplace of Pope Benedict XVI and one of the countries where the Church has come under the most pressure, abuse by priests seems to have been most widespread several decades ago - as in the US - but also relatively contained. Christian Pfeiffer, the director of the independent Criminality Research Institute of Lower Saxony and a former regional justice minister, says about 150 priests in Germany have been accused of abuse alleged to have taken place since 1990. That is about 0.1% of the 138,000 active priests in the country, he says - though he estimates that the rate of abuse was higher in earlier decades. Child abuse cases have eroded confidence among some Catholics ""We assume that three-quarters of the cases are old cases from the 50s, 60s and 70s,"" says Mr Pfeiffer, who has approached German Church authorities about doing a full study of the issue. In Ireland, where about 1,000 witnesses told the 2009 Ryan report on abuse in Catholic institutions that they had been victims of sexual abuse, that abuse is thought to have peaked at a similar time. Mr Pfeiffer says that in Germany, the attention the subject has gained has led to misconceptions about the extent of abuse. ""There is a big gap between the reality and the public debate,"" he says. ""I can understand that people are angry at the Church because it was terrible how they treated the victims, how they treated the offenders. ""But the public assumption that the German Roman Catholic Church has the same kind of problem as those in Ireland or the United States is wrong, as the quantity is much smaller."" Overall, from 2001-2010 the Vatican has considered sex abuse allegations concerning about 3,000 priests dating back up to 50 years, according to figures given last month by Monsignor Charles J Scicluna, who as the Vatican's Promoter of Justice heads the office that investigates such cases. Though the cases were spreading geographically, ""the phenomenon itself is much reduced,"" he said, noting that there are 400,000 priests worldwide. Amid intense media attention, questions have been asked - sometimes by Roman Catholics - about whether there are aspects of Catholic priestly life that encourage abuse. The vast majority of child abuse... is carried out by men who are heterosexual, and many of whom are married    Particular attention has focused on celibacy, though many experts dismiss the idea that this could be a direct cause of abuse. ""Celibacy can indeed be a challenge but the vast majority of sexual abuse is not committed by celibates,"" says Ms Smith. ""We found 4% [of priests] involved in child abuse - that means for 96% celibacy did not present a challenge in terms of child abuse."" Mr Pfeiffer says that in Germany, young priests have told him it would be possible to have sexual relationships with women if they really wanted to - lessening the risk of sexual frustration leading to abuse. But he also raises the ""hypothesis"" that paedophiles - who only represent a small minority of abuses - might ""become priests because they want to be protected against their hidden ideas"". Earlier this month Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state, rejected any relationship between abuse and celibacy, linking it instead to homosexuality. The remarks caused outrage among gay groups, and while research shows that most US victims were teenage boys, that is thought to be because this was the group to which priests had most access. ""The vast majority of child abuse [against] both male and female is carried out by men who are heterosexual, and many of whom are married,"" notes Ms Smith. She said she had been asked by a bishop whether there was a greater risk of abuse from homosexual candidates for the priesthood entering the seminary today. ""I said 'no, our research does not sustain that.'"" Whilst the John Jay has yet to publish a new report on the context and causes of abuse in the US, research to date points to a background of poor screening and training of priests, an over-reliance on psychologists, psychiatrists and lawyers, and an atmosphere of complicity in which people both inside and outside the Church often turned a blind eye to abuse. Some believe the scandals expose a crisis of authority in the Church In a letter to the Irish people published in March, the Pope placed abuse in the context of ""the rapid transformation and secularisation of society"", and mentioned a ""well-intentioned but misguided tendency to avoid penal approaches"". But the idea that secularisation fuelled abuse was challenged by Katarina Schuth, a US expert on seminaries who has worked recently in Europe. She noted that cases appear to have dropped off in the 1990s, even as the social changes continued. Ms Smith suggests social transformations did play a role in the US in that priests with ""little explicit preparation... were responding individually to some of the social influences that the 1960s and early 1970s brought to bear."" But she and Ms Schuth say steps have now been taken to improve screening and training. ""Reports often present the risk as if it were equivalent now to 1980. We don't see that in the United States,"" she says. Whatever the prevalence and causes of abuse, some are warning that the scandal will smoulder on unless institutional changes are made. Mr Walsh, the former Jesuit, says the crisis of authority that the allegations have brought about ""arises out of a culture among the clergy"" - one he thinks is reinforced by the insular nature of celibate life. ""That is why I think it's such a threat to the Church and it can only be changed by a regime change, a change at the top, because the Vatican's model is this authoritarian approach to Catholicism and the priests just pick it up.""

668,"The Oscar-winning American actor, Walter Matthau, has died of a heart attack aged 79. He was pronounced dead on Saturday morning shortly after being brought into St John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, said a hospital spokesman.       Over a carreer that spanned more than 40 years, Matthau, who became a Hollywood legend, appeared in more than 50 films. He was a popular character actor, and went from playing villains to become the modern king of the entertainment world's grumpy but lovable slobs. He is best known for his decades-long screen partnership with Jack Lemmon. It was their first duet in a 1966 film the Fortune Cookie that earned Matthau stardom. Matthau would later say of Lemmon: ""When were working we always seemed to understand what we're thinking about.""       Lemmon, himself a famous comedian, praised the funny side of Matthau. ""The biggest problem, and the only problem, I have working with Walter, who is a great actor, is that I have a great deal of difficulty not laughing."" Matthau's most recent comedy, Hanging Up, was released only this year, starring Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. Matthau's first big Broadway performance was in 1948, but it was his 1965 appearance in Neil Simon's The Odd Couple that launched him into stardom. The film version of the show released in 1968 became a classic.          The biggest problem, and the only problem, I have working with Walter, who is a great actor, is that I have a great deal of difficulty not laughing    Matthau won the Academy Award for best supporting actor for Billy Wilder's 1966 comedy The Fortune Cookie. In May 1993 he was honoured with a Lifetime's Achievement Award by America's National Association of Theatre Owners. The actor survived several serious health setbacks during his career. While making The Fortune Cookie in 1966, he suffered a bad heart attack. His doctor attributed it to smoking three packs a day and constant worry about gambling and told him to give up both. Matthau stopped smoking.          When were working we always seemed to understand what we're thinking about    In 1976, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in freezing weather for Grumpy Old Men in 1993, he was hospitalised for double pneumonia. In December 1995, he had a colon tumor removed. It tested benign. He was also hospitalised in May 1999 for more than two months after another bout with pneumonia. When Matthau was brought into St John's Health Center hospital on Saturday morning, he was in ""full cardiac arrest"" and was pronounced dead at 0142 am PDT (0842 am GMT)."
669,"The Philippines Catholic Church has apologised for sexual abuse by hundreds of its priests over the last 20 years.  The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines said on Monday that it was now drafting guidelines on how to deal with such offences by its clergy.  When sexual scandals involving Catholic priests in the US came to light earlier this year, the Philippines media began reporting on abuses by local priests.  Monday's statement was the first official response from the Church in the Philippines, where at least 85% of the 76 million-strong population is Catholic.  According to the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Orlando Quevedo, about 200 of the country's 7,000 priests may have committed ""sexual misconduct"" - including child abuse, homosexuality and affairs - over the past two decades.  ""To the various crises in society, we must now, with great sorrow and shame, add problems in the Church"", said a statement by the bishops read to a news conference on Monday.  ""Sexual misconduct on the part of shepherds of the flock betrays the holy priesthood that Christ has shared.""  A protocol is being drafted by the bishops on dealing with sexual abuse cases. The guidelines will include encouraging victims of assaults to file criminal charges, said the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference.  The Philippines is one of several Asian countries which have been wracked by sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church in the past few months.  Bishops in Australia and New Zealand have apologised to dozens of victims of sexual abuse carried out by priests and police are investigating several priests in Hong Kong for alleged indecent assault."
670,"Fifty million children are living in poverty in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, according to a new report.  The study, from the European Children's Trust, says that hunger and poverty in the countries of the former Soviet Union are now at levels approaching those in the developing world.  Within the region, the numbers of those living in poverty are more than 12 times what they were 10 years ago.  The Trust, an international development organisation, warns that with winter approaching, the situation threatens to reach crisis proportions.  The Trust says more than 168 million people were living below the bread line in 1993 to 1995, the latest available figure.  That's an increase from 14 million at the collapse of communism. The Trust believes the situation is now far worse. The proportion of the population living in poverty is as high as 88% in Kyrgyzstan and between 60 and 66% in Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Moldova. The report, called The Silent Crisis, highlights the plight of children. It warns that poverty is driving social breakdown with many families having to leave their children in state orphanages to ward off malnutrition.  The Trust says a crisis has been building since the old communist system disappeared. It claims a sudden relaxation of price controls, coupled with widespread privatisation of industry produced economic meltdown. Production fell, inflation soared and the safety nets provided by the old regime simply evaporated. The Trust suggests that rather than direct aid, the West should help the expansion of services preventing family breakdown."
671,"Lawyers were upset by suggestions in the film, which opens across Greece on Friday, that Alexander was bisexual.  They argue there is no historical evidence supporting claims that the Macedonian leader had male lovers.  ""Fortunately it was not what we had feared. The people can go and see the movie,"" said lawyer Giannis Varnakas.  ""There is a kiss that can be interpreted in many ways, but we have avoided the worst,"" added Mr Varnakas.  The group of 25 lawyers had claimed the film was ""not a true depiction of Alexander's life"", and wanted this made clear to cinema-goers.  They had requested a disclaimer at the start of the film warning audiences that it was not historically accurate.  However director Oliver Stone said there was a historian on set to ensure accuracy.  The lawyers' leader, Mr Varnakos, denied homophobia was the motive behind their action.  ""We would have reacted the same way if the issue didn't involve homosexuality,"" he said.  ""We just don't want a distortion of historical facts.""  The film opened in the US last week to a slew of negative reviews. It will be released in the UK on 7 January."

But while patients may pay for the initial screening, if a potential problem is discovered it is the NHS that picks up the bill for further tests, counselling and treatment.  The BMA says formal screening programmes, such as breast checks for women between 50 and 70, have been introduced because they have been proven to be of benefit in detecting disease.  But the BMA says there are numerous examples where screening is available without such strong evidence to support its use.  Research has shown for example, that mammograms in women under 50 may not detect small cancers, and that it involves a high chance of misleading results.  This can lead to further invasive tests and to surgery in many women whose cancers might never have progressed during their lifetime.  The use of the PSA test, which is provided on the NHS, is also questioned by the BMA, which says it ""cannot identify those who will die"" and warns the treatment of prostate cancer ""has side effects that can cause more problems than the disease"".  Two thirds of men with high PSA do not have prostate cancer, while some men with prostate cancer do not have high PSA.  The BMA adds that no evidence exists to show whether treating localised prostate cancer does more good than harm.  Concerns were also raised in the report about whole body computer tomography (CT) scans for people without any symptoms - which can cause false alarms and involve significant doses of radiation - and electrocardiograms (ECGs) for people without symptoms of heart disease.  The report says unregulated screening can put patients at risk because of a lack of evidence they are effective, no quality control, poor follow up and insufficient information before and afterwards.  It also says pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), now carried out on embryos to see if they carry an inherited disease.  Some are concerned it could be used to create 'designer babies' by selecting gender or eye or hair colour, but the BMA says, due to the difficulties involved, PGD is only to be used by couples at serious risk of having a child with a disease, and ""frivolous"" use is unlikely.  It adds there are concerns about the use of information on genetic tests on adults by insurance companies, and says the current moratorium should be used to consider if such information should be treated any differently from other medical data.  Dr Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA's Head of Science and Ethics, commented: ""There is no doubt that some specific screening tests have the potential to save lives but this does not mean that there are no associated risks.  ""We want the public to be extremely wary of unregulated screening.  ""People should be especially cautious about testing kits that can be bought through the Internet and mail order.  ""The BMA is also worried that even with the existing major programmes the information about the benefits and limitations may be insufficient for patients to make an informed choice based on the harms and benefits of taking part.""  Emma Taggart, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ""We know that mammograms are not as effective in women under 50, as breasts are dense and harder to image. Only women at a higher risk because of their family history are entitled to mammography, in the absence of any breast symptoms, before this age.""  Dr Chris Hiley, of the Prostate Cancer Charity, said: ""There are major uncertainties about the ability of the PSA test to identify correctly men who have prostate cancer and exclude, correctly, men who probably don't have cancer.  ""This is why the PSA test isn't available on the NHS in a screening programme and why we are urging the government to invest in research to find a better, more reliable test.""  Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation said the organisation did not support the indiscriminate use of exercise testing to screen patients with coronary heart disease. ""  I'm all for breast screening under 50. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago, I asked to go on the mammogram list, after my GP messing me about and a pointless visit to genetic medicine, I was refused. I don't blame women for attending private screenings. When my mother used to attend chemotherapy there was a girl of 16 there who had had a mastectomy and reconstruction, another girl of 24 and one aged 28, and still we're being told it isn't common in young women. Who is kidding who? If I had the money I would definitely pay.  Natalie, Scotland, UK  The system of medical checkups in Britain, including screening, is inadequate. Everyone should be given an annual general check-up on the NHS, covering eyesight, hearing, cancer screening, heart condition, blood pressure etc. This is what happens in Japan. I am sure regular check-ups would save the government in Britain a fortune, and make the nation healthier.   J. Riley, Japan  Yes, I recently had a CT heart scan, which can detect early signs of coronary heart disease (this would normally require invasive procedures). In my case the results were very good but it did occur to me at the time that regulating this kind of testing might be necessary - otherwise it becomes an extremely effective way of queue-jumping within the NHS and the cost of providing such tests to any and every patient who wanted them would be far more than the NHS could possibly afford. It's another example of a key dilemma facing the NHS and which is not being addressed how do you limit or ration health services if they are all free at the point of use? The NHS is part of the civilised society which Britain is but these issues must be considered, rather than ignored as this government has been doing, if the health service is going to survive in the face of dramatic (and costly) medical advances.   Tudor Lomas  My daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 34. She found the lump herself, by which time she had three tumours and half her lymph glands were affected. We have to find a more effective way of screening young women for this devastating disease.  Yvonne Osman, Newark, Nottinghamshire  The demand for private testing (for all kinds of things and as with health care generally) is driven by the reality that patients often have real concerns - that a test will definitively answer, quickly - that the NHS is unable or unwilling to address unless you are happy to wait for months on end, by which time the problem may be untreatable. It is not at all obvious that ""DIY"" tests done using labs or other forms of private medicine are any less reliable than tests done by the NHS. Unless and until the NHS can provide the service people want, it is entirely reasonable that people will seek alternative and supplementary ways to get health care when it is needed, rather than in 9 months. Doctors, politicians and the NHS need to face this reality and find ways to allow patients to make use of what is available outside and inside the NHS in a complementary way, rather than whining that such and such a treatment should be their monopoly.

674,"A booklet produced in 1987 told Soviet soldiers how to behave in Afghanistan. The last Soviet soldier left Afghan territory on 15 February 1989. ""The Internationalist soldier must always hold high the honour of the Soviet citizen."" ""The Internationalist soldier is forbidden to enter into unsanctioned relationships!"" In fact, while soldiers admitted that it was easy to fall into a trap, few avoided social contact with locals. Soldiers ""must never visit"" local shops or stalls. According to accounts, anything from Japanese watches to machine guns were on sale, and while alcohol was rare, hashish was easy to buy. ""The Internationalist soldier should not undress, sunbathe or swim in the presence of local people... because such behaviour... is considered offensive."" Soldiers were forbidden from looking at the faces of women or from starting conversations with them. The pamphlet said soldiers must not take gifts and bribes from local leaders. Soldiers said sometimes it was difficult to refuse them. Soldiers must ""observe a regime of secrecy"" and be careful who was listening, the pamphlet said. Many Afghans spoke good Russian, although they often tried not to show it.     "
675,"Five genetically identical fruit flies were produced at the lab of Dr Vett Lloyd at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.  They join an expanding menagerie of creature copies that now includes sheep, mice, rats, cows, and even cats.  Fruit flies have long been a ""model"" to study reproductive biology and the team thinks its insects may help science understand why cloning is often flawed.  ""That's pretty much the only reason why you would want to do this,"" Dr Lloyd told BBC News. ""There are more than enough fruit flies in the world.""  The Dalhousie fly clones were produced in a slightly different way to the method made famous with Dolly the sheep.  In that process, the genetic material of the adult animal to be copied was taken from one of its cells and injected into an emptied egg, and then coaxed into becoming a developing embryo.  For the Dalhousie flies, the donor genetic material came not from an adult cell but from an embryo cell.  It is generally thought to be easier to clone this way. Even so, it still took about 800 transfers to produce the five fly copies.  And the abnormalities that blighted many of the copying attempts echoed the problems seen in mammal cloning. Currently, many of the large animal clones that are born experience ill-health and die prematurely.  This acts as a bar to the application of cloning technology in areas that might improve the quality of agricultural livestock or produce useful drug products in animals.  Researchers believe the very low efficiency is due to the injected genetic material failing to properly ""reprogramme"" back to a true embryonic state.  Normal reproduction relies on a key process known as imprinting. This allows only specific copies of genes to be active, depending on whether they come from the male sperm or the female egg.  The Lloyd team intends to investigate this issue with their fly clones.  Flies are relatively easy to experiment with and scientists have a good grasp of their genetics (the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was decoded in 2000).  ""If we can see in flies where the process goes wrong and these genes are conserved in mammals then maybe you could correct it in mammal cloning - but that is a long, long way down the road,"" Dr Lloyd said.  The group's work has now progressed to produce a dozen clones."
676,"Schumacher recovered from a last-place starting position on the grid following a stall to power his way up to third in the final, championship-deciding grand prix of the 1998 season.  Savouring his victory, Hakkinen said: ""When Michael was forced to start from the back of the grid it raised an enormous amount of pressure from me.  ""The race was not as difficult as others I've had this season. But a lot of that's down to the team who kept letting me know where Eddie and Michael were.""  ""When Michael went to the back I knew it was up to me. I made a fantastic start and got close to Mika at some points but just couldn't manage to get in front.""  It is the first time in seven years that McLaren has won the drivers' championship.  The tension rose before the race began with a false start by Jarno Trulli in the Prost Peugeot, which sent him to the back of the line up and shortened the race by one lap.  The Ferrari had nudged forward by a couple of inches and stalled as the German put it into gear.  Schumacher acknowledged the mistake, which gave him a mountainous 20 cars to overtake, with only the tiniest shake of his head.  The final race of the 1998 season eventually got under way after being reduced from 53 to 51 laps.  The initial sparring saw the second Ferrari of Eddie Irvine race into second from third, behind Hakkinen, the leader.  But he found himself stuck behind two-time Suzuka winner Damon Hill in the Jordan, and the subsequent battle put nearly 30 seconds between the German challenger and Hakkinen before he could move up to fifth.  The Monaco-based driver, whose racing career was in doubt after an horrific crash in Australia in 1995, managed to squeeze a hand out of the cockpit to acknowledge his eighth grand prix victory of the season.  Damon Hill finished a clinical race by grabbing fourth at the final corner to give the Jordan team fourth - their highest ranking in the constructors' championship.  Williams finished a disappointing season with Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jacques Villeneuve in fifth and sixth respectively.  McLaren also took the constructors' championship for the eighth time in its history.  British driver Johnny Herbert came in 10th in his final ride for Sauber before driving for Stewart next year.  The 1999 season begins in Melbourne on 7 March."
677,"   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the world's best-loved fairytales. As Judy Garland's famous film nears its 70th birthday, how much do its followers know about the story's use as an economic parable? Dorothy in Kansas conjures up nostalgic thoughts of childhood Christmases hiding behind the sofa from the Wicked Witch of the West. Or those flying monkeys. It's unlikely its young fans will have been thinking about deflation and monetary policy. The 1939 film is the most famous evocation of the story But the story has underlying economic and political references that make it a popular tool for teaching university and high school students - mainly in the United States but also in the UK - about the economic depression of the late 19th Century. At a time when some economists fear an onset of deflation, and economic certainties melt away like a drenched wicked witch, what can be learnt from Oz? The 1939 film starring a young Judy Garland was based on Lyman Frank Baum's book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900. It told of an orphaned Kansas girl swept by a tornado into a fantastical world, but who wants to return home to her aunt and uncle. Thinking the great Wizard of Oz can grant her wish, she sets out to meet him with her beloved dog, Toto, joined by a scarecrow, a tin woodman and a lion. Baum published the book in 1900, just after the US emerged from a period of deflation and depression. Prices had fallen by about 22% over the previous 16 years, causing huge debt. Farmers were among those badly affected, and the Populist political party was set up to represent their interests and those of industrial labourers. The US was then operating on the gold standard - a monetary system which valued the dollar according to the quantity of gold. The Populists wanted silver, along with gold, to be used for money. This would have increased the US money supply, raised price levels and reduced farmers' debt burdens. In 1964, high school teacher Henry Littlefield wrote an article outlining the notion of an underlying allegory in Baum's book. He said it offered a ""gentle and friendly"" critique of Populist thinking, and the story could be used to illuminate the late 19th Century to students. Since its publication, teachers have used this take on the tale to help classes understand the issues of the era. Wizard of Oz: US presidents of late 19th Century Wicked Witch: A malign Nature, destroyed by the farmers' most precious commodity, water. Or simply the American West Oz: An abbreviation of 'ounce' or, as Baum claimed, taken from the O-Z of a filing cabinet? And Littlefield's theory has been hotly debated. He believed the characters could represent the personalities and themes of the late 1800s,with Dorothy embodying the everyman American spirit. US political historian Quentin Taylor, who supports this interpretation, says: ""There are too many instances of parallels with the political events of the time. ""The Tin Woodman represents the industrial worker, the Scarecrow is the farmer and the Cowardly Lion is William Jennings Bryan."" Bryan was a Democratic presidential candidate who supported the silver cause. But he failed to win votes from eastern workers and lost the 1896 election. In the same way, the Lion's claws are nearly blunted by the Woodman's metallic shell. The Wicked Witch of the West is associated with a variety of controversial personalities, chief among them the industrialist Mark Hanna, campaign manager to President William McKinley. In this scenario, the yellow brick road symbolises the gold standard, the Emerald City becomes Washington DC and the Great Wizard characterises the president - and he is exposed as being less than truthful. Yet none can help Dorothy return home. Eventually she discovers that her silver shoes (changed to ruby for the film) have the power to take her back to Kansas. The allegory is still taught in schools The possible implication is that gold alone cannot be the solution for the problems facing the average citizen. But Professor Taylor thinks it's unlikely the book took sides. Instead he says it was merely explaining the story of the Populist movement, some of whom marched on Washington DC in 1894 to demand government improve their plight. Their demand for the use of silver with the gold standard was not met, although within a few years, inflation returned after discoveries of gold in South Africa and other parts of the world. In Baum's story, Dorothy loses her silver slippers in the desert before she reaches home - a possible reflection of the decline of the silver cause after 1896. But not everyone believes The Wonderful Wizard of Oz includes any hidden meanings. ""Nobody ever suggested it until 1964,"" says Bradley Hansen, who is a professor of economics at the University of Mary Washington. ""There's no solid evidence that Baum had written it as a monetary allegory,"" he adds. ""While it may have grabbed students' interests, it doesn't really teach them anything about the gold standard and, in particular, the debate about the gold standard."" Professor Hansen thinks the author was just trying to create a new kind of fairytale, the ""Harry Potter of its time"". There's no solid evidence that Baum had written it as a monetary allegory    Soon after publication, Baum adapted his book into a stage musical for adults which opened in 1902. Ranjit Dighe, who wrote The Historian's Wizard of Oz, says it poked fun at Theodore Roosevelt and the Populists, but Baum was playing for laughs, like Jay Leno. Little can be learnt from Baum about the modern economic crisis, says Professor Taylor, although in both instances people have demanded more government action. The Bank of England has - as the Populists more than 100 years ago demanded - provided a boost to the monetary supply, although the term ""quantitative easing"" was probably little known in the 1890s. And ultimately the US defeated deflation by creating money from new discoveries of gold abroad. L Frank Baum died before the debates over his true intent had started. But in the book's introduction, he stated that he was only writing to please children. He was no doubt unaware of its future appeal to economics students. Below is a selection of your comments. I never thought of TWOO as an economic parable, but it always makes me smile that poppies put you to sleep and snow wakes you up. Was that in the book or is it just Hollywood?   Carol, Manchester No real surprise - a children's story with a deeper subtext. Look just a little closer and you'll find a whole host of subtexts in children's books most noticeably the assignment of gender roles, fears about the adult world, awakening sexuality etc. I'd be interested to hear possible deeper meanings of the sequel Oz books. I'm told that the Disney film Return to Oz, which I found very disturbing as a child, is actually very close to the books - with electro convulsive therapy, and a witch who steals the heads of beautiful young girls.   Susanna, Southend-on-sea Having played the Tin Woodman in a stage version of The Wizard of Oz myself, and having taught a course in the relationships between literature and economics for years, I'm a long-time subscriber to the allegorical interpretation. Baum allegedly denied any underlying meaning, but lots of artists like to disclaim hidden agendas and let the audience do whatever the audience will do with the work. And what about the US's geographical divisions: the Bad Witches are of the East and West; the Good, from the North and South. For East read banks and railroads; for West, read gold dealers and more railroads; for North, read the heart of the Populist movement; for South, the agrarian region most harmed by the depression. Sure, Baum was just playing around...   John Stifler, Amherst, Massachusetts, US I had to smile when I read this story. People can choose to see anything they like. For decades, the gay community has had a fond regard for The Wizard of Oz, perhaps because it could be described as a bunch of misfits finding their way in the world. If you look hard enough and use a little creative licence, anybody can find anything in a movie like this. Interpretation is everything.   David Holder-Twomlow, Birmingham, UK And there I was thinking that it was just another anti-communist rant.   Stephen Shingler, Cheadle, Staffs Funny how many people seem almost offended by the idea that this fairytale is an allegory. Seems most people have forgotten what fairytales are... yes they are entertaining, but that is not their purpose. Like ancient (and modern) myths, they are an allegory first and foremost, intended to teach the (originally often ill-educated) public, both young and old, about various moral and practical aspects of their time and life in general. Whether or not the Wizard of Oz was intended as such is beside the point, if it now can function for that purpose, why not?   Alban Paul, Amsterdam The Wizard of Oz always reminds me of the great Sufi poem, The Conference of The Birds by Farid ud-Din Attar, written almost 1,000 years ago. The story of a group of birds looking to someone else to solve their problems until they get to the end of the journey and realise that, through their trials and tribulations, they found everything they were looking for within themselves. Gregory Maguire - author of Wicked and Son of A Witch - mentions that themes in his book were inspired by this poem.   Samar Habib, London I experienced the use of The Wizard of Oz as a teaching tool for both American history and economics. Whether Baum intended it or not, it does work, and it certainly helped me remember where everyone stood on the silver debate for my exams.   Barton, Minneapolis, US Perhaps the Munchkins' song was actually a clever prophecy about Sir Fred Goodwin's post-RBS lifestyle:   We get up at twelve   And start to work at one   Take an hour for lunch   And then at two we're done   Jolly good fun!   Prescient, eh?   Martin Ruck, Oxford, UK Maybe it's a warning of the future? Dorothy (citizens) keeps being told by Tin Man (industrialists with no heart), Scarecrow (banks with no brain) and Lion (politicians who have lost control of the people or animals in the jungle), that when you reach the end of the yellow brick road (finish using the gold standard) you will reach the emerald city (start using fiat money) and everything will be OK. But the Wizard was a fraud, his gifts were shallow and it was all a fantasy. Just like the money which is created by the federal banks clicking its heels together, then demanding interest or they'll send the monkeys after you.   Paul, Aberdeen Why do people have to find hidden meanings? The author himself insisted he was just writing for children, so why not leave it at that? And if no one decided about the hidden meaning until 1964, it smacks of someone trying to make a name for himself by picking on a well-known story and trying to make something else of it.    Anne Boyce, Halifax, England Can we not be allowed to enjoy a fairytale as a fairytale, loved by millions of children (and adults), without this constant need to analyse everything? It would do society a great deal of good to get a life and start to use your imaginations again and enjoy musicals for their own sake even if they do have a deep meaning. Don't we have enough doom and gloom in the world?   Jenny, London The Wizard of Oz is a simple political allegory of politicians running away from trouble when they find out and leaving trouble in the hands of the ordinary. The Wicked Witch is our blame culture, the one the politicians pin the problems on.    Elphaba, Kiamo Ko Having read the book for the first time quite recently, none of this rings true and the very specific suggested allegory requires a real stretch of the imagination. The story of an ineffective unelected leader exercising control over the populace by means of trickery and deception could certainly be regarded as an allegory during a period when the power of monarchies was being eroded in many parts of the world, but merely follows a similar universal principle to the Emperor's New Clothes and is therefore nothing new. While it is understandable that Baum would portray a politician as lacking courage, it is harder to see why he would portray farmers or industrial workers as lacking either brain or heart. Surely even a malign Nature or American West (as allegedly represented by the Wicked Witch) would be nourished by water rather than being destroyed by it? The book is nothing more than a rather pedestrian effort at a fairytale. The alleged link with the Populists seems to be the fancy of a man with too much time on his hands and an interest in a rather overlooked period of history. Marvellous film, but don't read the book to your children unless you're trying to bore them to sleep.    Iain Wishlade, Birmingham, UK Iain, you need to watch the movie again. The scarecrow turned out to be the smartest member of the band of unlikely heroes, and the tin woodsman had the most heart. And they had them all along. I am certain that the story really is allegorical. I have also heard it described as a Marxist fable, and it can fit quite nicely. Like the LOTR trilogy, or Wagner's Ring cycle, it taps into lots of ideas and themes that were floating around when the author wrote the story but it doesn't correspond exactly to any of them, and it is more than a complicated allegory, because it also stands on its own, simply as a story. That's probably why we are still reading it and watching it. For my money, it's still the best ""children's"" movie ever made, and it's nice to have a girl for a hero for a change.   Diane Jenkins, Albuquerque, NM, US I had always thought of the Wizard of Oz as a warning against advertising, as seen then in the catalogs, and the promises of their products solving life's problems. Is this its own economic parable or connected to the one stated in the article?   David DeNaples, New Haven, CT, US The remarkable art of the Wizard of Oz is its ability to appeal on several levels. It stands with the Harry Potter novels, and Mark Twain's most prominent works, in its use of a children's story to reach adults.   Frank S, Oyster Bay, NY Economic parable? Strange. I had always thought that the story was a warning against putting trust in religions, gods, magic and other supernatural things. The wiz was ""god"" (pay no attention to the man behind the curtain), the emerald city was heaven (a lie - travellers were given green sunglasses to wear on entering the city) etc.   Mysturji, Basingstoke, UK Maria, that the movie is not a faithful adaptation of the book underscores how unlikely it was that Baum was attempting to offer any allegory regarding the financial woes of the US in the early 20th Century. Certainly it can be said that authors, playwrights and screen writers can unwittingly impose some of their own beliefs into their works, I have found that it is seldom the case that there are ""hidden"" messages to be found. People will see what they want to see.   Sam Crawford, Sault Ste Marie, Canada Baum may have been influenced subconsciously by the spirit of the times. However, I think the attempt to portray The Wizard of OZ as political allegory is much more a case of interpreting things backwardly than the case of basing it on allegorical political fact. Baum wrote a good a story. Leave it at that.    Paul, Okinawa Yes, in my family we all knew - and were always astonished by how few people actually remembered the truth about this rather horrid little narrative. Certainly not actually children's fare.   Maria Ashot, London, UK The Wizard of Oz is also used to teach story-telling and screen-writing, which is more than just an incidental point. Much though the term is overused, the WoO is full of ""universal themes"", making it very easy to see parallels with other stories or situations. It's primarily a journey of discovery where the characters succeed by overcoming their own short-comings. Many stories are, so why not take the Lord of the Rings as a parable where the populist fellowship march to mount doom (Capitol Hill) in order to destroy the ""gold standard"" ring? So much sophistry.   Rob Egginton, Bristol, UK I remember fondly watching this movie in my Advance Placement US History class and afterwards discussing the meanings behind the film. Though our teacher was pleased with how well we picked up the meanings, she was equally impressed with our knowledge of how the Pink Floyd album syncs with the movie, and other titbits about the movie.   Rob Rubinstein, Chicago, IL, US Wait, wait... If you start Bernanke's 60 Minutes interview the second time the MGM Lion roars you can hear John Lennon say ""I am the goldbug"" right before Dorothy's house squishes the witch...   Noneyo, Texas Here is a little known fact about L Frank Baum and the entire Oz series. Baum never lived in Kansas. He was actually born in a small town called Chittenago, New York, which is 12 miles from where I currently live. Buam's wife was the daughter of Matilda Joslyn Gage, a prominent member of the Women's suffrage movement here in the United States. Baum himself was a prominent supporter of Women's Suffrage and it is no accident that his protagonist in the novels is female.    Joe Cooter, Syracuse, NY The next story will be about the country with a leader having a pair of tailors, and a fabulous see-thru fabric to make a new suit. All the ministers will say how wonderful he looks in the suit, which really is figure hugging, and very modern, and they offer to pay for it. Needless to say this could only be fiction from the last millennium, and not relevant to us.   Derek, Sunbury on Thames     "
678,"When I was formally sworn in as governor, the chief secretary said the Falklands was a tranquil and absorbing place. It was anything else but tranquil in 1982.  But I liked the islands as soon as I got there. The people were friendly. I felt very much at home.  There had been deliberate neglect of the islands.  The advice I was given before I went out was to win the confidence of the islanders, because they were very suspicious of the Foreign Office.  What was left unsaid, but was quite clear, was they wanted me to win the confidence of the islanders so that they could sell them down the river to Argentina, because the Foreign Office regarded it as an anachronism.  But in my first dispatch I said: ""There is no way we will convince these islanders that they will be better off as part of Argentina"".  Argentina never had a proper claim to the Falkland Islands. Their claim was spurious from the very beginning.  My first intimation of an impending invasion didn't come until Thursday 1 April at 3.30pm when this top secret telegram came from the Foreign Office  It was couched in typical Whitehall jargon: ""We have apparently reliable evidence that an Argentine task force could be assembling off Stanley at dawn tomorrow. You will wish to make your dispositions accordingly.""  My assistant remarked: ""Well they might have said goodbye and the best of British"".  I decided Government House would be the operational headquarters for the Royal Marines.  After I had sent my wife and son to a safer house, I told the domestic staff to go away and just take their few most valuable possessions. Nanny, our housekeeper, got her priorities right.  Off she went with a picture of the Queen under one arm and a bottle of gin under the other.  From five to six the next morning until dawn, which was 6.35, it was a very fierce fire fight. I was under my desk with my assistant. I had to make a conscious effort to think through the noise.  People say ""weren't you frightened?"" I think I would have been but I was stunned of all emotions because of the noise.  I had a little handgun and I was going to use it if they got as far as my office.  At about 6.35, the firing subsided and (Royal Marine Major) Mike Norman popped his head round the door and said: ""We've repulsed the bastards"".  I could hear some groaning and I said ""Mike, we'd better get our injured in,"" and he said: ""They're not ours, they're theirs.""  That was when I realised how close they were. There were three of them who had been shot in my wife's vegetable garden just 15 yards from where I was.  I knew I would have to give in sometime. My one anxiety was how many lives I had to lose before I gave in, and had we done enough to resist to get the response from Britain that we needed?  If I had known Maggie Thatcher as well then as I know her now I would not have had that anxiety.  I got the admiral in charge of the task force to come to me and he urged me to give the order to lay down arms.  He said otherwise I would be held responsible for any further casualties.  I did point out that it is the people who start the shooting that are to blame. But I did take his point. It was an overwhelmingly superior force.  [At 1230, the governor, wearing his plumed governor's hat, went to the town hall in Stanley to meet the Argentine general commanding the invasion]  ""There was this rather miserable little general, sallow faced, coming towards me with a fixed smile on his face. I really felt the anger surge then and I thought: ""This is just the rape of the Falkland Islands.""  I refused to shake hands with him and said: ""You have landed unlawfully on British territory and I order you to remove yourself and your troops forthwith.""  He said: ""We have taken back what is rightfully ours and we shall stay forever.""  I had to get out by 4.30 that afternoon. We were flown to Montevideo.  [Back in Britain] I didn't know anything more than the general public about what was going on. I was never invited into any of the confidential briefings at the Foreign Office. It was ridiculous.  When I went back the Falklands it was very emotional.  The islanders insisted on grabbing me by the hand and putting their arms around me. They will forever be grateful for the sacrifices people made.  Was [the war] worth it? Yes, undoubtedly so. Just look at the poor Argentines now and look at the prosperous islanders. They have done tremendously well since then.  All sorts of things have happened that couldn't have happened had it not been for Galtieri's folly.  We still have a lot of friends out there.  During the occupation we were sitting [in Britain] looking at the television to see how the islanders were getting on.

679,"The distinguished history of RAF Duxford is to be told in a new interactive exhibition.  It is the first permanent display specifically dedicated to the airfield and those stationed there.  RAF Duxford was a fighter station during World War II and is now part of the Imperial War Museum.  The new exhibition will be housed in the former Watch Office which oversaw the airfield and is planned to open in late 2012.  RAF Duxford opened as a training station towards the end of World War I.  During the following war, the airfield achieved fame as a fighter station and was the first RAF base to operate the Spitfire.  During its history, Duxford has also served as a USAAF fighter base before being taken over by the Imperial War Museum in the 1970s.  The new display, called Historic Duxford, will be housed in the old Watch Office.  In the 1930s this building was manned by the Duty Pilot who observed each day's flying activities.  Built in 1918, it will be restored to its former glory and will tell Duxford's story through the eyes of the men and women who worked at the iconic fighter station.  The exhibition will combine period reconstructions with state-of-the-art interactive displays and real objects.  Focusing on those who served on the base, hundreds of hours of memories of ex-Duxford personnel will also be available.  The exhibition's team are hoping more people with memories of the Duxford will get involved.  A meeting for community feedback is being held on Thursday, 10 March at 1900 GMT.  It will take place in the Marshall Auditorium in AirSpace at Imperial War Museum Duxford.  Have you got a story to tell about RAF Duxford? Tell us about it at cambridgeshire@bbc.co.uk"
680,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A Nottinghamshire singer has released a Christmas song she hopes will challenge Simon Cowell's X-Factor winner for the festive number one spot. Christmas Time is the title of Cathy Lesurf's single that comes out 30 years after she was last in the charts. As a member of Fiddler's Dram she reached number three in 1980 with Day Trip to Bangor. Cathy's song will not have the publicity clout of the X-Factor release. Her budget is £150. Three decades ago Cathy Lesurf performed on Top of the Pops with her group Fiddler's Dram. They never repeated the success of Day Trip to Bangor and are forever bracketed ""one hit wonders"". Cathy feels now is the time to lose that tag. The seeds of the song come from the death of a friend. Cathy and her husband, David Wilson, were putting together a benefit gig for Linda Sawyer when she died from cancer. The concert still took place and the legacy was that, after years of steering clear of the stage, Cathy and David were back behind the microphone. It rekindled their love of music. Then Cathy's 19-year-old daughter Rosalyn alerted her to the fact that more than 60,000 people had watched clips of Day Trip Bangor on YouTube. I wish him (Simon Cowell) all the luck in the world and I wish myself all the luck in the world. Let the people decide    Cathy Lesurf on competing against the X-Factor contestants It just so happened that David had written a tune for Cathy called Christmas Time. The singer said: ""We're all singing it round the house and I thought maybe it's time Bangor had a companion piece and I said 'hello' to all those people out there who like what I do."" The song was recorded in October 2009. A few weeks later a video was filmed in Cathy's back garden featuring family and friends. It was shot in a day. The whole process cost around £150 after Cathy, from West Bridgford, called in some favours. She said it matched the spirit of the song. ""It's about getting the family together, getting the tree, the presents. It's having a big Christmas Eve party, it's singing carols. I love the traditional message of Christmas. I love the love in it."" The chorus to the song goes: ""All the family round the tree, A gift for you, a gift for me."" Day Trip to Bangor was a hit for Cathy Lesurf and Fiddler's Dram in 1980 Composer David Wilson said: ""That's the heart of it - sharing gifts and expressing love and affection. It's thinking about the person you're buying the gift for."" Now Christmas Time is available to download (CD versions might be pressed if there is a demand), a facility that was not available when Fiddler's Dram were in the charts. ""This is something new for me. I come from the days of steam driven music,"" said Cathy. ""We're emailing everybody we know and we're asking everyone to download it and pass it on. We want it to go out at grassroots level. If it goes it'll be because people have made it go."" David Wilson said the omens are good. ""People I've played it to have made such a strong connection with it. It's a simple expression of the joy of Christmas. ""For that to make an impact gives me faith. It tells me people want to feel that simple love and affection."" David Wilson was not a fan of Christmas until he met Cathy Cathy Lesurf verses Simon Cowell is the musical equivalent of David verses Goliath but the Nottinghamshire singer is undaunted. ""I prefer to go with a positive approach that they'll do their thing and it's very different to mine. ""I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I could get back in the charts. I hope people hear it and like it and it's another little miracle like Bangor. ""I wish him (Simon Cowell) all the luck in the world and I wish myself all the luck in the world. Let the people decide.""     "
681,"Seven Manchester United footballers are among 21 dead after an air crash in Munich.  The British European Airways (BEA) plane caught fire shortly after take off this afternoon with 38 passengers and six crew on board.  The footballing world is reeling from the loss of some of its most talented young players - known as the Busby Babes.  Their average age was 24 and they included Roger Byrne - the captain - Mark Jones, Eddie Colman, Tommy Taylor, Liam Whelan, David Pegg and Geoff Bent.  Eight British sports journalists and several club officials have also been killed.  The Queen has said she is ""deeply shocked"" and has sent a message of condolence to the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.  The chartered aircraft was bringing the Manchester United entourage back from a European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia and had stopped at Munich's Riem Airport to refuel.  On the third attempt to take off the plane over-shot the runway, hit a house with its port wing, veered to the right, hit another building and burst into flames.  The fuselage did not catch fire and several crew and passengers went back into the wreckage to rescue the injured.  Team manager Matt Busby was described as being the most seriously hurt and is being given blood transfusions in hospital.  Star striker Bobby Charlton has been treated for slight head injuries.  According to the Chief Executive of BEA, A. H. Milward, there was a heavy snowstorm in Munich and the pilot delayed departure because he was dissatisfied with one of the plane's engines.  This was the first fatal accident for this type of BEA aeroplane, which has carried 2,340,000 passengers on 86,000 flights since it began service in 1952.  The same plane - called Lord Burghley - took the Manchester United entourage out to Belgrade on Monday."
682,"Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes has completed his takeover of Premier League newcomers QPR.  The 47-year-old has secured a 66% stake in the club, buying out previous majority shareholders Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone.  Fernandes will work alongside the Mittal Family, who have retained their 33% stake.  ""QPR is a raw diamond and hopefully I can contribute into turning it into a diamond,"" said Fernandes.  He will take the role of chairman of QPR Holdings Ltd and will be joined on the board by joint Tune Group owner Mr Kamarudin Bin Meranun, one of Malaysia's most successful business tycoons.  ""Everyone knows I've followed West Ham all my life but I've always had a soft spot for QPR,"" said Fernandes, who is also team principal of Formula 1's Team Lotus. ""Rangers were one of the first teams I watched as a child at Loftus Road.""  Amit Bhatia, who will resume his position as vice-chairman, told the club's official website: ""I'm very excited to welcome Tony to QPR and having spent considerable time with him, know that we share the same vision and values.  ""We have discussed in great detail how to restore pride at the club and I'm very pleased with the outcome of these discussions.  ""It was a very difficult decision to resign from the board when I did, so I'm thrilled to be back and would like to thank all those who supported me and my family and look forward to serving the club to the best of my abilities again.  ""Tony and I will work alongside each other to try and make this season as exciting and successful as possible. I love this club and this is a very happy day for me.""  Fernandes added: ""The opportunity to get involved with the club was mentioned to me by the previous owners and here I am.  ""I've always wanted to be involved in football and the appeal of a London club, like QPR, was too good an opportunity to turn down.""  QPR won promotion back to the Premier League by winning the Championship under manager Neil Warnock last season.  They kicked off their campaign back in the top flight with a 4-0 home defeat by Bolton last weekend but Fernandes has already given his backing to the former Sheffield United and Crystal Palace boss.  ""It's a momentous day,"" said Warnock. ""Everybody connected with QPR should be excited.""  Fernandes added: ""I have ambitions in the long term.  ""I could easily say we're going to win the Champions League and the Premier League but that's really not my style. I don't want to make big promises I can't guarantee.  ""I want the fans to be proud of what we're doing and be involved as much as we can.  ""The fans pay good money and are stakeholders, so whatever we do, I want the fans to be proud. We'll do it in style and with integrity.  ""I'm keen to create a good Academy, so that there's a constant supply of players. We're in a fantastic part of London and we should be bringing kids through.  ""The third aspect is to be a strong partner in the community and to make a difference in the community.  ""Of course, you don't go into anything in the sporting world and not want to be the best, but these things take time and I'd rather let the results speaks for themselves."""
683,"+ The two Night Glows are on Thursday 12 August and Saturday 14 August. + They start at around 2100 BST, and last around an hour. + The start time can sometimes vary if the balloon pilots have to travel back far from the evening's mass ascent. + The firework display starts at the end of the Night Glow. Thousands head to Ashton Court to see tethered balloons and the 'naked' basket and burners light up in time to music. There are some good spots to see the event, and make sure you don't miss out on the fireworks afterwards. Probably the most obvious is the hill by Church Wood, which last year looked something like Henman Hill at Wimbledon! The problem with the hill is that everyone plans to get there early, and bags their spot hours before. So if you want to grab a bit of the view, we suggest you take a picnic basket, rug, and warm clothing and get there before the mass ascent at 1800. If you can't get up on the hill, then the next best place is ringside at the bottom of that hill. Get as close as you can to the fence to make sure you can see, and don't fall foul to some tall bloke standing in front of you. Again, this area fills up very quickly during the evening, but you should be okay to arrive some time between 1900 and 2000 to get a good spot. The rookie mistake to make at the Night Glow is to go the other side of the arena - there's a very good reason it fills up last.  You can't see the fireworks very well because of the tree line. The display is usually spectacular, with many of the rockets sounding like artillery shells being fired. The only advantage to being this side is its proximity to the car park - which considering the bridge is closed this year, could be quite a bonus.  It depends how desperate you are to get home quickly! Of course, if you decide to miss part of the Night Glow during the rush back to the car, you can always watch it later here on bbc.co.uk/bristol. If you are extremely jammy, the ultimate view of the Night Glow is from the hospitality tents.  Time to start pleading with the boss ...  "

685,"   Engels lived a double life in Manchester. By day he worked for his father’s firm of ‘capitalist exploiters’, while at night he became a social investigator. He met with other industrialists and businessmen and followed the lifestyle of his bourgeois station. Meanwhile he devoted his spare time to exploring the political scene and the lives of the Manchester working class.     He wrote for several socialist and radical papers during this period, both in England and continental Europe, on a variety of issues. For Robert Owen’s ‘The New Moral World’ and the Chartist papers, the ‘Northern Star’ and ’Democratic Review’, he wrote on the campaigns of the day such as the ten hours bill and others that were attempting to improve peoples working conditions. He highlighted the lessons that could be learnt from them. He also described the characteristics of socialism and other political developments on the continent. For the continental papers he wrote about the economic developments and the lessons that could be learnt from the class struggle taking place in England.     Soon after his arrival in Manchester he began a relationship with a young woman, named Mary Burns. She was to become his partner until her death twenty years later. It is not certain where they met, although it is widely believed that she was a probably an employee at the Engel’s and Ermine mill. It was Mary who introduced and guided him through the dwellings of the Manchester working class.     Words: Danny Crosby                  "
686,"In a small, noisy laboratory, tucked away in London's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, a tiny plant is growing.  It looks just like a very small parsley bush, but it is actually a very special little plant indeed.  Clean air has to be constantly circulated in the lab to protect it from any bacteria.  This precious specimen is the Anogramma ascensionis fern, commonly known as the parsley fern. Since the 1950s, botanists believed it to be extinct.  It is native to Ascension - an island in the South Atlantic, which is one of Britain's overseas territories. And a small project supported by Kew's overseas territories programme has rediscovered and rescued it - a timely success story, as this year has been dubbed International Year of Biodiversity.  Kew botanist Phil Lamden and local conservation officer Stedson Stroud found the plucky little plant clinging to a precarious existence on a mountainside in the harsh volcanic landscape.  ""We were down the back of Ascension's Green Mountain, which has very, very steep slopes. You have to be really careful because if you slip you're a goner,"" Mr Stroud recalled.  ""And we came across this beautiful little fern and immediately knew it was the lost Anogramma that had been extinct for the last 60 years.""  Ascension is covered by bleak, forbidding lava flows, and only 10 plant species are known to be truly ""endemic"" - found nowhere else in the world.  According to Kew scientists, goats that were released on to Ascension by Portuguese explorers in the 1500s, ate their way voraciously through the island's greenery for 350 years before any of the flora was even described to science.  The introduction of more invasive herbivores - rabbits, sheep, rats and donkeys, together with over 200 species of invasive plants, further squeezed out the island's original plant inhabitants. The rediscovery of Anogramma boosts to seven the number of surviving endemic plant species on the island.  Mr Stroud said that, in the excitement, both of the researchers ""forgot where they were"".  ""We were scrambling around, looking to see if there were more, and then we realised, we should really have safety ropes and stuff around us,"" he said.  There were more plants - four in total. But as far as the researchers knew, these were all that remained of Anogramma. So with the help of his colleague, Olivia Renshaw, Mr Stroud mounted a rather perilous effort to protect them.  ""We had to keep the plants alive - they were on a bare rock face and it was a really dry period, so Olivia and I went down twice a week carrying water and we set up a drip feed,"" said Stedson.  After a few weeks of tending the plants, the next part of their plan was even more risky. They had to get pieces of the ferns back to Kew so that more plants could be grown in the safety and sterility of the lab.  Stedson climbed down the ridge one again - this time to collect a few small cuttings of the spore-forming or reproductive parts of the plants.  Once harvested, the spores were vulnerable to drying and contamination, and the team had just 24 hours to transfer the precious cargo to the laboratory in Kew's Conservation Biotechnology Unit (CBU).  The samples were placed in a sterile container and rushed to the nearby airfield. From there, they were flown to a military airport in the UK, where a car was waiting to race them to Kew. Fortunately, the dust-like fern spores survived the journey intact.  Dr Viswambharan Sarasan is head of the CBU. He explained that their arrival was not the end of the challenge.  The spores had to be bleached to eliminate any bacteria, before the plants could be grown in culture.  ""That is the really risky part,"" he said. ""If you bleach them for too long, you could kill the spores, but if you don't treat them for long enough, there could be remaining bacteria that will grow in culture and kill them.""  And Dr Sarasan had only a 1p-piece-sized clipping of fern to work with - the smallest sample he had ever cultured from.  After another nervous period of waiting, he was relieved to discover that the process had left the spores intact and viable.  He and his colleague Katie Baker, a botany undergraduate student working at Kew, have now succeeded in growing 60 new Anogramma plants in culture - all from four tiny plants on a cliff face in Ascension.  The team hope eventually to restore Anogramma to its former wild habitats on Ascension's Green Mountain.  And Mr Stroud has even managed to grow some of the plants in a shade house on the island itself.  ""Each and every day, you're there, tending and looking, and hoping that something will happen,"" he said.  ""Then one day you see something and - watching the plants grow - you can't ask for anything more.""  Colin Clubbe, who leads the UK overseas territories programme at Kew, says that this rescue effort was a small but vital part of a much wider goal to protect native plants in Britain's overseas territories before they are lost forever.  Plants are such an important component of our lives,"" he said. ""And if we lose them, we lose them - extinction is forever.  He says that ""holding on to our natural environment"" could help us protect many of the plants we depend on.  ""We do exploit species - we're reliant on plant products. We use them as a source of genes and, in these extremely dry habitats, like Ascension, plants that are naturally adapted may hold some answers to things like plants' responses to climate change.""  This is actually the third extinct plant that Mr Stroud has rediscovered and, for him, it is an ongoing and very personal mission.  ""There's never a time that I'm not actually looking fort these species because, we say they're extinct, but I believe they are there,"" he said.  ""It's so satisfying, bringing a plant back from the brink of extinction.""  Hear more from the researchers on Science in Action on the BBC World Service on Friday 25 June."
687,"A row has erupted after Blizzard - the publishers of the popular online game World of Warcraft - announced that users on its site forums would have to post under their real names.  The firm say the move is to put an end to heated online arguments and topics started purely to cause trouble.  But users reacted angrily, citing concerns about safety and privacy.  Blizzard said they would start implementing the changes over the next few months.  A post, by Vaneras - one of the site community managers - said that the forums had become "" a place where flame wars, trolling and other unpleasantness run wild"".  ""Removing the veil of anonymity typical to online dialogue will contribute to a more positive forum environment, promote constructive conversations, and connect the Blizzard community in ways they haven't been connected before,"" the post continued.  Blizzard's new system - Real ID - means that users will have to post under their real first and last name.  The firm said it will implement the changes over the next few weeks, with the StarCraft II forums - a section dedicated to the forthcoming real time strategy game - making the switch by the end of the month. The World of Warcraft forum will change soon after.  In addition to users now posting under their own names, the site will allow others to rate post and interact with other users, creating a ""social-networking platform"".  ""As the way gamers interact with one another continues to evolve, our goal is to ensure Battle.net is equipped to handle the ever-changing social-gaming experience for years to come,"" the post by Vaneras went on.  The online community was swift to respond, with more than a thousand replies in less than 24 hours; the majority of which expressed their displeasure at the move.  ""I can't even begin to fathom why you would do this"", posted one user, while another wrote that it seems ""like someone who likes Facebook came up with it, while being blissfully unaware that an awful lot of people deliberately avoid Facebook"".  One World of Warcraft player, Jim Brand, contacted BBC News to say how disappointed he was over the change.  ""I have been using the forums for over five years, reporting bugs and trying to be helpful. Now, to have the privilege to help people on the forums I have to reveal my real name; I'm dead against it,"" he said.  ""I work in a charity and deal with governments officials. If they do a search and see I am a gamer, it could affect my employment prospects,"" he added.  Although most social networking sites have links to a person's real world name, gaming sites have always used anonymous handles.  There have been a few rare cases of online gaming disputes spilling out into the real world, and users are mostly reluctant to reveal personal details, given that video games can sometimes elicit strong emotions.  Mr Brand said that one Blizzard employee posted his real name on the forums, saying that there was no risk to users, and the experiment went drastically wrong.  ""Within five minutes, users had got hold of his telephone number, home address, photographs of him and a ton of other information,"" said Mr Brand"

690,"The UK maker of the Nurofen ""specific pain"" range of products has defended their packaging, after an Australian court ordered the products off shelves.  The court said the UK-based Reckitt Benckiser had misled consumers.  It said products marketed to treat specific pains, such as migraine, were identical to one another.  Nurofen said the products had been ""designed to help the consumer easily navigate our range"", particularly in groceries where there was no pharmacy.  ""Consumer research indicates that 9 in 10 people (88%) look for pain relief for a specific type of pain (eg headache, migraine, back pain) and 7 in 10 (71%) say pain-specific packs help them decide which product is best for their needs,"" said Dr Aomesh Bhatt, regulatory and medical affairs director for Nurofen.  ""How to pick the best painkiller""  The products affected by the Australian court order include Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) watchdog had brought the matter to court earlier this year.  The ACCC said the court had found that the firm had ""engaged in misleading conduct in contravention of the Australian consumer law by representing that its Nurofen Specific Pain products were each formulated to treat a specific type of pain, when the products are identical"".  Each product contained the same active ingredient, ibuprofen lysine 342mg.  The ACCC said the products were found to be ""no more effective at treating the type of pain described on its packaging than any of the other Nurofen specific pain products"".  The comission's research also found that in Australia the products were sold for almost double the price of Nurofen's standard product.  The retail price for each of the pain-specific products was also found to be ""significantly higher"" than other comparable products, the ACCC added.  Manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser said the case related only to Australia, and that it was continuing to work with regulators there ""to ensure Nurofen packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements"".  It said the ruling would not be applicable in other countries, including the UK, where it sells Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache in caplets, as well as Nurofen Express Period Pain in soft capsules.  ""As such all Nurofen products remain available and there will be no changes to packaging,"" the company added.  The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for ensuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines including over-the-counter painkillers in the UK.  It said: ""For over-the-counter medicines informative names are permitted to help patients select an appropriate product without input from a healthcare professional.""  It added, that, with regard to '""informative names"" - they are allowed as ""an aid for patients to select the appropriate product without input from a doctor or pharmacist but they can't make misleading medical claims"".  Richard Headland, editor of Which?, said: ""Our research shows many painkilling medicines have exactly the same active ingredients, despite vastly different marketing, packaging and pricing. Our advice to people is to buy cheaper generic medicines wherever possible and, if in doubt, ask a pharmacist.""  The Federal Court of Australia said the products must be taken off Australian shelves within three months.  Reckitt Benckiser said that it would comply with the Australian court order and that it ""did not set out to mislead consumers"".  Reckitt Benckiser makes a vast range of household products, including Nurofen, Dettol and Harpic, among others.  It has been ordered to publish correction notices in newspapers and on its website and to pay the ACCC's court costs.  This story has been amended to clarify that the products in question were different from the standard Nurofen product."
691,"Michael Portillo is to chair a £55m scheme to help arts organisations develop long-term funding plans.  About 50 organisations are expected to benefit from the grants, which will start at £500,000.  Groups will be able to bid for grants of up to £5m, but will be expected to raise double that amount through the private sector.  The Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will fund the scheme.  The money will be available to arts organisations across the UK, and it is hoped applications can begin to be submitted in early September.  The £55 million is part of a £100 million pledge to support philanthropy.  The funds will be given as an endowment, with the interest used to pay the groups' running costs.  Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who announced the plans during a speech at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, said: ""World class cultural organisations should have world class financial resilience.  ""Michael Portillo is passionate about culture and will bring real wisdom to a process that will start a much-needed change in our approach to cultural fundraising.""  Alan Davey, Chief Executive of Arts Council England, said: ""Arts and heritage endowments will provide a range of opportunities for arts and cultural organisations to build their skills and capacity to fundraise, to match-fund using new ideas and to invest for their long-term health and creativity.""  In December 2010, Mr Hunt announced an £80 million fund to help increase philanthropy. This was made up of £50 million from Arts Council England and £30 million from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).  Mr Hunt announced on Monday that this would be boosted by an additional £20 million Heritage Lottery Fund contribution.  Shadow Culture Secretary Ivan Lewis, said: ""The test of its success will be whether public funding triggers new private giving, which would not otherwise have been raised, and supports arts organisations which currently receive little or no philanthropic support to develop this source of funding.  ""By Mr Hunt's own admission, this fund will do nothing to help organisations currently scaling down activities and struggling to survive as a result of the Conservative-led government's disproportionate cuts to the arts."""
692,"The latest new vodka brand has caused a row in the US state of Idaho. But why are so many different types of the colourless, flavourless spirit on sale in the US and UK?  ""I judge a vodka by how I feel the next day. Our hangovers are minimal,"" says Steve Conlin, vice-president of marketing for Ogden's Own Distillery, makers of Five Wives Vodka.  ""It's made from spring water from a mountain spring. It's a good clean vodka.""  Five Wives sold well in Utah, where it is produced and bottled.  But when Conlin applied for a licence to sell it in neighbouring Idaho, it was rejected by the state liquor authority, which decides what gets stocked in the state's stores.  The authority's director, Jeff Anderson, did not like the cheeky name - a reference to polygamy practised by the 19th Century ancestors of America's Mormon population. Also, he said, there was simply no room on the shelves.  ""We've got an over-proliferation of vodkas,"" Anderson told the Idaho Business Review last week.  Idaho sells 450 varieties of vodka, he said, including different sizes of a single brand, and Five Wives would have to compete with 106 other vodkas in its price range.  ""We're telling people 'no' a lot of the time,"" he said. ""Beyond the name, this product is trying to enter a competitive set that is crowded already. ""  In recent years, drinkers in the US and the UK have been overwhelmed by a glut of new vodka brands.  Some of those are traditional Eastern European brands newly introduced on the export market, and others are ""dreamed up overnight"", says Jerald O'Kennard, director of the Beverage Testing Institute in Chicago.  ""It's relatively easy to produce,"" he says. ""You don't have to age it in a warehouse, in a barrel like a whiskey or a rum, and they're the most popular spirits. You've got a tsunami of economic and business reasons contributing to those numbers.""  The spate of new entrants comes even though most drinkers cannot tell the difference between vodkas of similar quality, spirits experts say.  In the US, by law, classic vodka is near flavourless. US regulations require that vodka produced in the US be ""neutral"" and be sold ""without distinctive character, aroma, taste or colour"". Vodkas with added flavouring such as vanilla or rasberry are treated differently.  Spirits experts say that in fact, drunk neat and at room temperature, premium vodkas do offer a variety of subtle variations in flavour, sweetness, mouth feel and weight.  But the average punter who orders a vodka-tonic cannot taste the difference, and even in blind taste tests average drinkers cannot consistently distinguish between different bottles, according to analysis by market research firm Mintel.  ""They're using it in mixed drinks,"" says Noah Rothbaum, editor-in-chief of Liquor.com and author of The Business of Spirits.  ""Once you add it to, say, cranberry juice, or once it's shaken with a lot of ice, those differences are harder and harder to differentiate.""  Many American vodkas contribute little to the actual manufacturing - they merely purchase 95% ethyl alcohol from industrial giants like Archer Daniels Midland or Midwest Grain Processors, add water, and filter the product to varying degrees.  With little noticeable distinction in taste, vodka makers rely on sophisticated marketing and branding campaigns to win customers, analysts say.  ""Making it stand out on the back bar, on the liquor store shelf, making it look cool on the table in a club, these are not small considerations,"" Rothbaum says.  Most wine bottles conform to a handful of different shapes. But companies launching a new vodka brand will hire teams to design a distinct bottle to catch the eye, for instance. (Cheap Shot sells its ""knockout quality"" vodka in a box.)  Distilled Resources Inc, also in Idaho, ferments, distils and bottles high-end flavoured and unflavoured vodkas for dozens of brands who contract with the company.  ""They came up with the name, they selected the bottle,"" says Gray Ottley, the distillery's director and vice-chairman, about one of the vodkas.  ""That's their brand. They filed the trade mark.""  In fact, three of the company's oldest brand partners - Blue Ice, Glacier and Zodiac - sell the same potato vodka, Ottley says.  Ogden's Own, based in Ogden, Utah, markets its vodka to drinkers who want something made locally.  The label, which features five young women in 19th Century dress coyly tugging at their petticoats, was an irreverent nod to Utah's Mormon history.  ""Our label is quirky and interesting,"" says Conlin. ""People like local.""  It has sold well in the six months it has been on the market, approaching Absolut in the 750ml category, he says.  Since Jeff Anderson of the Idaho liquor authority suggested religious and moral considerations played a role in the decision to keep Five Wives off the shelf, Ogden's Own hired a prominent Washington constitutional lawyer.  On Wednesday, Idaho relented and agreed to allow retail customers, bars and restaurants in the state to place special orders of Five Wives. Anderson also invited Conlin to reapply to sell Five Wives on store shelves.  ""The exposure's been very good,"" Conlin says.  ""We're happy to have this resolved and hopefully we'll be selling product in Idaho fairly quickly."""
693,"Scotland Yard has hailed the security operation surrounding the royal wedding as an ""amazing success"" despite 55 arrests around its security zone.  About half the arrests were for breach of the peace and a man was held for an alleged sex assault on a girl, aged 14.  Ten people carrying climbing gear and anti-monarchy placards were arrested near Charing Cross.  Other arrests were for drunk and disorderly, criminal damage, theft and over a suspected environmental protest.  Three people were held in the Covent Garden area over the alleged demonstration, police said.  Anti-terror powers were used to arrest one man who was seen taking suspicious photographs of transport hubs and security personnel in the Charing Cross area.  Three others were held over drug offences and four for allegedly carrying an offensive weapon.  Met Police Assistant Commissioner Lynne Owens said the success of the overall policing operation showed that the force could handle security for next year's Olympic Games.  She said her 5,000 officers should be ""immensely proud"" of their role in the ""happy and safe"" event.  She admitted to pre-event ""nerves"" and defended the decision to carry out a string of pre-event raids as ""entirely justified"".  An estimated one million people had gathered along the wedding route.  The police said that number was more than expected.  Officers questioned masked anti-monarchy protesters in Soho Square as a huge security operation took place around Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and The Mall.  Thousands of police officers created a ""ring of steel"" around the venues. Snipers took to rooftops and undercover officers mingled among the crowds  More than 90 people were banned from the area and up to 80 VIPs were granted personal protection.  Over the past few days police have arrested three people believed to be planning to behead effigies at the wedding.  They were detained by police in Brockley, south-east London, on Thursday night.  There were also several raids on squats across London, which drew criticism from one Labour backbencher.  John McDonnell accused police of ""disproportionate"" action, saying the raids appeared to be ""some form of pre-emptive strike"".  Elsewhere, anti-monarchy group Republic held a peaceful ""not the royal wedding"" street party in Red Lion Square, Holborn."
694,"Two men have been convicted of the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, 18 years after he was stabbed to death near a south London bus stop.  Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty by an Old Bailey jury after a trial based on forensic evidence.  Scientists found a tiny bloodstain on Dobson's jacket that could only have come from Mr Lawrence.  They also found a single hair belonging to the teenager on Norris's jeans. Sentencing will be on Wednesday.  In an exclusive interview with the BBC's Panorama, Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence said: ""I don't forgive the boys who killed Stephen. They don't think they have done anything wrong.  ""They took away Stephen's life and there is nothing in their behaviour or anything to show they regret what their actions have done and the pain it has caused us as a family.""  In a statement read by his lawyer outside the Old Bailey, Stephen's father, Neville Lawrence, said the convictions were a moment of joy and relief - but he could not rest until all of those who killed his son were brought to justice. He described the investigation and preparation of the case as ""faultless"".  He later told Channel 4 News: ""I'm praying that these people now realise that they've been found out and say to themselves, 'yes I did this awful deed, but I wasn't alone in that action that night and there are other people also guilty of what I've done' and name them.  ""I hope before the sentence is passed, they will talk and give the rest of these people that killed my son up.""  Duwayne Brooks, Stephen's best friend who had been with him on the night of the murder, tweeted: ""Some justice at last"" ""Some justice at last"".  Acting Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, acknowledged that police believe there were five people involved in the murder, but there are currently no ""live"" lines of inquiry.  ""If there was an opportunity to bring the other people who were involved in that night to justice, we would do so,"" she said.  The original failed investigation into the murder led to the Metropolitan Police being branded as institutionally racist.  Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he was stabbed to death near a bus stop in Eltham, south east London, in April 1993.  Police identified five men who were later named in a damning public inquiry as the ""prime suspects"".  By that time, there had already been a catalogue of police errors and two failed prosecutions, one brought by Stephen's parents.  But in a four-year-long cold case review, a fresh team of forensic scientists uncovered microscopic evidence linking two of the five men to the murder - evidence that the police had held all along.  The material - bloodstains, clothing fibres and a single hair belonging to the teenager - were recovered from the clothes of the suspects which had been seized in 1993.  Scientists recovered the material using advanced techniques which were not available to the original case scientists.  Dobson, 36, and Norris, 35, denied the murder. They said their clothing had been contaminated as police mixed up evidence over the years. Detectives spent months establishing the movements and handling of the exhibits since 1993 - and the jury were told that contamination was implausible.  Dobson was jailed for five years in 2010 for drugs trafficking. He is among a small number of men to have been tried twice for the same crime after the Court of Appeal quashed his 1996 acquittal for the murder.  Norris was convicted in 2002 of a separate allegation of racially threatening behaviour.  In mitigation, ahead of sentencing on Wednesday, counsel for Dobson said there was no evidence he had been the leader or prime motivator of the group that attacked the teenager.  Norris's counsel repeated his client's pleas of innocence - and revealed his client had been beaten up while on remand at Belmarsh prison, suffering a broken nose and four broken ribs.  Mr Justice Treacy discharged the jury and thanked them for their ""dedicated service"". He told them the public owed them a debt of gratitude.  As the defendants left the dock, Dobson told his family not to worry, and Norris waved to the gallery. Members of both men's families shouted back.  The Metropolitan Police's Acting Deputy Commissioner, who ordered the 2006 cold case review that led to the convictions, said the case had been extremely important for the Lawrence family, the force itself and society at large.  Cressida Dick added: ""It's a matter of huge regret to the Met that it has taken 18 years to get to this point.  ""It has been a unique case in policing. Firstly the horrible, horrible nature of the attack on the night, the time in which it has taken to bring anybody to justice, and the tireless campaigning of the Lawrences.  ""There is no comparable case. All homicide cases are terrible, but for us it is a very important case.  ""Most importantly, we wanted to be able to bring people to justice for the killing and try to give Doreen and Neville Lawrence and their family some sense of justice."""
695,"The government is to create a marine reserve almost as big as the UK in the Atlantic waters of Ascension Island.  Just over half of the protected area will be closed to fishing.  The fishery in the other half will be policed under a grant of £300,000 from the Louis Bacon Foundation, a charitable body.  It is the latest marine reserve to be declared around remote islands, which will increase marine conservation zones to about 2% of the ocean.  That remains a far cry from the 30% recommended by scientists to preserve species and expand fish stocks, but is much more than just a few years ago.  Governments have designated marine parks at Palau in the North Pacific, Easter Island and Pitcairn in the South Pacific, and New Zealand's Kermadec islands, in what has become a landmark year for ocean conservation.  The latest reserve at Ascension Island is said to hold some of the largest marlin in the world, one of the largest populations of green turtles, big colonies of tropical seabirds and the island's own unique frigate bird.  The reserve totals 234,291 sq km, slightly less than the size of the United Kingdom. It could be ready for formal designation as soon as 2017, once further data has been collected and analysed.  Dr Judith Brown, director of fisheries and marine conservation for Ascension Island government, said: ""The economic benefit from the fishery has provided much-needed income for the island.  ""This donation will help fund the enforcement to protect the closed area from illegal fishing.""  The Great British Oceans Coalition, which includes the Blue Marine Foundation and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, has been campaigning since 2014 for the designation of all or part of Ascension's waters.  Charles Clover, Blue Marine Foundation chairman, said: ""Ascension has been at the frontiers of science since Charles Darwin went there in the 19th Century, so it is entirely appropriate that it is now at the centre of a great scientific effort to design the Atlantic's largest marine reserve.""  An accident of colonial history has left the UK and France with huge potential to safeguard marine life around remote oceanic islands.  The Conservative party promised in its 2015 manifesto to create a ""blue belt"" of protected ocean round the UK's Overseas Territories.  The commitment was described by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith as ""the biggest conservation commitment by any government ever, pledging to protect an area of ocean three-and-a-half times the size of Britain""."
696,"With a pledge of free bananas for the town's children, football mascot H'angus the Monkey was the ""joke"" candidate to be mayor of Hartlepool.  Some 11 years later - and with three election victories under his belt - it seems Stuart Drummond, who leaves office on 5 May, was no comedy character.  A referendum in November signalled the end for the mayoral system and Hartlepool Council will instead be governed by committees.  Tapping away at his keyboard with framed Hartlepool United shirts and squad photographs behind him, Mr Drummond joked he had seen ""too much"" of his beloved team's relegation season.  He still has a season ticket at Victoria Park where his campaign began as a stunt.  ""I was always looking for something new to get a little bit of publicity for the club and just have a bit of fun along the way,"" he said.  The club's chairman loaned his mischievous mascot the £500 deposit and things soon got serious.  ""Never for one second did I expect to win,"" he said. ""I hadn't prepared for anything, it was a case of winging it and making it up as I went along.""  Mr Drummond, a father-of-three, said he had an ""extended honeymoon period"" with those outside the civic centre, but not some of the councillors he was working alongside.  ""The public saw me as one of them and almost put a protective arm around me to support me through those early years.  ""Getting the respect and credibility from councillors? I probably haven't even got it from some of them now, but that was always going to be a challenge.""  There was a ""huge shift"" in attitudes, Mr Drummond said, when he was re-elected in 2005 with a majority of more than 10,000.  He looks back over his tenure with pride.  ""I've been quite overwhelmed by the support I've been given from people and the amount of people who have expressed their disappointment at what's happened,"" he said.  ""If all those people had voted in the referendum we might have had a different result.""  The mayor insisted the result of the poll does not rankle with him personally as he would not have stood for a fourth term.  ""It's a shame that nobody else will get the opportunity to step into my shoes and bring a fresh pair of eyes to it and take it to the next stage,"" he said.  ""It's not really the system of governance that's important, it's about how the town fares and the decisions that are made.""  Having one directly-accountable figurehead for the town has helped Hartlepool punch above its weight, Mr Drummond believes.  ""Hartlepool is like one of the biggest villages in the country. There's a strong community spirit and a lot of local pride here.  ""To have somebody to be able to promote that on a regional, national and international basis is a big benefit.""  Hosting the Tall Ships in 2010 gave the town a huge boost in confidence, the mayor said.  ""For us to bring the world to Hartlepool and see so many people smiling and enjoying themselves, that doesn't really happen that often.  ""Every day in this role you're always trying to improve things and make people feel better in their own lives. The Tall Ships did it perfectly.""  Mr Drummond took a deep breath before describing the ""most challenging"" role of his life.  Soon after joining Cleveland Police Authority, he found himself elevated to chair.  ""Little did I realise the 12 months that lay ahead,"" he said.  ""I didn't realise the state the authority was in. It was on the verge of government intervention because it was so poorly governed.""  Operation Sacristy, a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption at the authority, began in May 2011, six months before Mr Drummond took over.  The investigation continues and the former chief constable and deputy chief constable have been sacked for gross misconduct in recent months following separate misconduct hearings.  ""If it was a TV drama it would be quite hard to believe,"" Mr Drummond said.  ""In the fullness of time everything will be made available and people will make their own conclusions. All I can say is I wouldn't want to go through that again.""  If Mr Drummond breathed a sigh of relief on leaving his police role, his wife Rebecca will be even happier when he leaves his current job.  ""She cannot wait for 6 May when I won't be elected mayor anymore. She doesn't like the attention it brings and some of the publicity. She's really looking forward to it.""  So what does the future hold? There are, Mr Drummond said, ""a couple of irons in the fire"".  ""I've had some interviews recently and I've been telling some of these tales and people have been flabbergasted.  ""From day one the whole thing has been unconventional. It's not a bad thing to have on your CV I don't suppose.  ""Whatever I do next I will always be banging the drum for Hartlepool.  ""That's in my blood now."""
697,"Comber early potatoes have been granted protected geographical indication(PGI) status under European law.  The potatoes are prized for their distinctive earthy, nutty flavour and characteristic soft smooth skin.  The granting of PGI status means the new season Comber potato joins an elite group of high quality European products, including Parma ham, Champagne wine and Stilton cheese.  PGI status recognises the regional importance and distinctive characteristics of the Comber spud and means that only new season potatoes harvested from the fields of Comber and the surrounding area can be marketed as new season Comber earlies.  PGI legislation came into force in 1993 and provides for a system for the protection of food names on a geographical or traditional recipe basis.  The scheme highlights regional and traditional foods whose authenticity and origin can be guaranteed.  Under this system a named food or drink registered at a European level will be given legal protection against imitation throughout the EU.  In their application for the special status, the Comber growers pointed out the climate of the designated area means that the soil dries quicker, reducing the risk of frost in the winter months.  The area is dominated by Strangford Lough, the largest inlet in the British Isles. The soil surrounding the lough is red sandstone and gravel and means it is lighter and free draining.  This means that the growing season can start before other potato-growing regions in Northern Ireland and the potatoes can be harvested earlier than anywhere else.  The history of the designated area is synonymous with potato growing and is intertwined with the history of two Ulster-Scots families, the Hamiltons and the Montgomerys.  It is the area of the Hamilton lands and the Montgomery lands, including Comber, Greyabbey and Newtownards, where new season Comber potatoes are still grown.  The historical link with the original plantation venture is evident in that there are still a number of Hamiltons growing Comber potatoes."
698,"Conservative MP Louise Mensch has apologised to former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan for accusing him of ""boasting"" about hacking phones.  She told the Commons select committee last week that Mr Morgan had been ""very open about his personal use of phone hacking"" in his memoir The Insider.  But she now says she made a mistake and had misread a newspaper report about the book.  Mr Morgan, who denied the accusation, thanked Mrs Mensch for her apology.  Mrs Mensch made her remarks during the Commons culture, media and sport committee hearing with News Corporation bosses Rupert and James Murdoch on 19 July.  This later developed into a row between the pair on Twitter after Mrs Mensch stood by her remarks but declined to repeat them outside Parliament, where comments have greater legal protection against libel proceedings.  During the hearing the Corby MP - best known as the best-selling author Louise Bagshawe until she married Peter Mensch, manager of rock band Metallica, in June - asked why the committee not spoken to Mr Morgan about phone hacking.  She said: ""As a former editor of the Daily Mirror, he said in his book The Insider recently that that 'little trick' of entering a 'standard four digit code' will allow 'anyone' to call a number and 'hear all your messages'.  ""In that book, he boasted that using that 'little trick' enabled him to win scoop of the year on a story about [former England football manager] Sven-Goran Eriksson. That is a former editor of the Daily Mirror being very open about his personal use of phone hacking.""  A furious Mr Morgan, who now hosts his own programme on the US news channel CNN, called the claim ""a complete outrage"" and challenged her to provide evidence for it.  He also accused her of being ""cowardly"" by using parliamentary privilege to make it.  On 21 July, Sly Bailey, chief executive of Daily Mirror publisher Trinity Mirror, wrote to the committee demanding the MP correct her remarks.  ""On two occasions Mrs Mensch made uncaveated statements purporting to be facts,"" she wrote. ""On both occasions she made allegations that are wholly untrue.""  In a letter to committee chairman John Whittingdale on Friday, Mrs Mensch said she had ""wrongly stated"" that Mr Morgan had ""been open about personally hacking phones"".  ""This was based on my misreading of an article in the Daily Telegraph... which covered Mr Morgan's description in his book of how to hack a phone and how he won the Scoop of the Year on the story of Sven-Goran Eriksson and [TV presenter] Ulrika Jonsson.  ""The Telegraph report covers the claim of a blogger that this story was acquired by phone hacking, and I misread that as Mr Morgan himself claiming this to be true.  ""Therefore, I must apologise to Mr Morgan and the committee for this error about his book.""  Mr Morgan later said on Twitter that he ""graciously accepted"" her apology.  Earlier on Friday, Mrs Mensch admitted it was ""highly probable"" she had taken drugs while working for record company EMI in the 1990s.  She said MPs were ""entitled to a life before politics, including making mistakes""."
699,"A bill which allows same-sex weddings to take place in Scotland has been passed by MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.  MSPs voted by 105 to 18 in favour of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill.  The Scottish government said the move was the right thing to do but Scotland's two main churches were opposed to it.  The first gay and lesbian weddings could take place this autumn.  Religious and belief bodies can ""opt in"" to perform same-sex marriages.  Ministers said no part of the religious community would be forced to hold such ceremonies in churches.  During a debate at Holyrood, MSPs rejected amendments which were said to provide ""protection"" for groups and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage.  The SNP's John Mason tabled an amendment stating that no-one could be ""compelled by any means"" to solemnise gay marriage, including by a contract or a legal requirement.  Gay and lesbian couples are allowed to marry in sixteen countries around the world. That includes England & Wales where the first same-sex weddings are due to take place at the end of March. In Scotland, the government says it wants ceremonies to become available ""as soon as possible"". The BBC understands that it will be October - at the earliest - before this happens. By the end of 2014, Northern Ireland is expected to be the only part of the UK that does not allow same-sex marriage. Critics fear the Scottish legislation could lead to those with a traditional view of marriage facing discrimination. But the Scottish government insists that freedom of expression is fully protected. It has yet to decide whether or not to open civil partnerships to mixed sex couples.  Mr Mason said that this was similar to a measure included in the bill passed by the UK Parliament allowing same-sex marriage in England and Wales.  Health Secretary Alex Neil insisted there were ""robust protections for religious bodies and celebrants"" in the bill and the amendment was unnecessary.  Mr Mason tabled further amendments, including one calling for recognition that ""a belief in marriage as a voluntary union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others for life is a belief worthy of respect in a democratic society"".  He said: ""This has been the prevailing view in Scotland for centuries, and may now be considered a minority view or even old fashioned, but it is an integral tenet of faith for many Christians, Muslims and others as well as the belief of many of no faith position at all.""  Mr Mason added: ""We have seen volunteers in the third sector removed from the board for publicly supporting traditional marriage.""  The first same-sex weddings in England and Wales will take place from 29 March, in the wake of legislation already passed by the Westminster parliament.  In Scotland, same-sex couples currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, but SNP ministers brought forward their Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill, saying the move was an important step for equality.  MSPs were allowed a free vote, rather than along party lines.  Mr Neil said passing the bill meant ""a historic day in the history of the Scottish Parliament"", which received the front-bench backing of Labour's Jackie Baillie and Conservative Jackson Carlaw.  Gay rights organisations, including the Equality Network and Stonewall Scotland, and a range of other groups, have supported the legislation.  But the Scottish Catholic Church and Church of Scotland oppose the move, and have said they have no plans to conduct same-sex marriages.  And the campaign group Scotland for Marriage said the safeguards in the bill did not go far enough.  Quakers have campaigned in favour of same-sex marriage and have said they would allow ceremonies to take place on their premises.  Other religious groups which back change include Buddhists and the Pagan Federation.  The Church of Scotland - whose ruling General Assembly last year voted to allow actively gay men and women to become ministers - has said the institution stood against homophobia, but added that the ""wide spread of opinion"" on gay marriage was reflected among members of congregations across the country.  As well as the main bill, Scottish ministers have also reached an agreement with the UK government for an amendment to the 2010 Equality Act.  The move aims to protect individual religious celebrants, who do not wish to conduct same-sex marriages, from the threat of court action claiming discrimination.  Westminster's Marriage Act which became law last July, will allow religious organisations to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales banned in law from doing so.  The Church of England, the Church in Wales and other faith groups have stated their opposition to gay marriage.  A report commissioned by the Church of England has recommended that members of the clergy should be allowed to offer blessings to same-sex couples.  The Northern Ireland Assembly is not currently considering any legislation to allow same-sex marriage.  The Scottish government's marriage bill was brought forward after a government consultation, which produced a record 77,508 responses."
700,"A United Nations report accuses Eritrea of planning a car bomb attack at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.  The UN Monitoring Group report on Somalia and Eritrea says the aim was to disrupt the summit in Addis Ababa last January.  Ethiopia accused its neighbour of training rebels to carry out bombings on targets in the city, including an international hotel.  Eritrea has repeatedly denied any involvement in such a plot.  ""We say this is totally a fabrication and the report is absurd. We have never been involved in any acts of terrorism,"" said the Eritrean ambassador to the UN, Araya Desta, in a radio interview with the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.  The report states that Asmara's spies are active in Uganda, South Sudan, Kenya and Somalia, posing a threat to regional peace and security.  The UN interprets the plot as representing a shift in tactics by the Eritrean intelligence services.  ""Whereas Eritrean support to foreign armed opposition groups has in the past been limited to conventional military operations, the plot to disrupt the African Union summit in Addis Ababa in January 2011, which envisaged mass casualty attacks against civilian targets and the strategic use of explosives to create a climate of fear, represents a qualitative shift in Eritrean tactics,"" said the report.  It outlines the details of the plan: to attack the AU headquarters with a car bomb as African leaders took breaks, to blow up Africa's largest market to ""kill many people"", and attack the area between the prime minister's office and the Sheraton Hotel, where most heads of state stay during AU summits."

Taking off from where Koi Mil Gaya left off, Krrish opens with the late Rohit's son Krishna being taken care off by his grandmother, Rekha. Rekha soon realises that Krishna too has the super powers that an alien had passed onto her son Rohit. Fearing exploitation at the hands of the evil and selfish ones, she takes a super intelligent and powerful Krishna away from human civilization - somewhere unknown. Krishna grows up amongst the plants, trees animals, fishes and mountains but soon realises that his super powers also make him stand out among his friends, often alienating him. He yearns for a normal life, not one where he can fly and run faster than any bird or animal. At this point in time, enters Priya (Priyanka Chopra), an adventure tourist from Singapore. Krishna saves her life and falls in love with her. Priya leaves for Singapore, but using her false charms, lures Krishna for exploitation on a television show. But Krishna, who goes to Singapore, refuses to swallow the bait. Slowly, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Krishna, uses his powers to save people during a circus performance. He hides his true identity by using a a mask - the masked man becomes known as Krrish to the Singapore population. But thats not where this action packed film ends. Krrish discovers that his father has been destroyed by the evil, megalomaniac Dr. Arya (Naseerudin Shah), a scientist who wants to control human destiny. So the final forty minutes or so of the film revolve around the clash between evil and good. The film has excellent special effects, on par with the best from Hollywood. Of the cast, Hritik lives and breathes his role, displaying helplessness, anger, determination and romance with equal versatility.Here indeed, is an actor par excellence. Priyanka supports well while Rekha and Naseerudin are ever dependable. The music, except for the Dil Na Diya song, is mundane. The film, which is already proving to be one of the biggest money-spinners, not only in the UK cinemas but also around the world, is too good to miss."
702,"You are in: > Clarks ends shoemaking in Somerset    Up to 90 workers at the Clarks shoe factory near Ilminster are coming to terms with the prospect of having to look for another job. The closure marks the end of shoemaking in the county. Managers at the Street-based footwear manufacturer told staff on Friday 8 January that the only way the company can survive is by switching production to the Far East. ""The cost of manufacturing in the UK has increased over the last 20 years, and we have been able to source our shoes cheaper in the Far East."" The closure of the plant near Ilminster marks the end of an era in Somerset. Although the firm's headquarters and warehouse will remain open, the factory in Dowlish Ford is its last manufacturing base in the county. Clarks Shoes began life as a sheepskin-tanning company in Street in 1825, branching out into footwear with the launch of a range of slippers in 1830.    Let us know your views on the factory closure, and the end of shoemaking in Somerset, using the form at the bottom of the page. One worker told the BBC in January: ""It has been on the cards for a long time and we've been fighting a losing battle for years now."" A union spokesman said that, although the announcement was expected, it had still shocked members. Managers responded that the move is essential for the company to survive. Spokesman John Keery said: ""The cost of manufacturing in the UK has increased over the last 20 years, and we have been able to source our shoes cheaper in the Far East."" What do you think about the factory closure? Where does Somerset's future economic prosperity lie? The BBC reserves the right to edit comments submitted. Mrs J Curwood  A disgrace that the factory should close, it means we are losing another part of our heritage/history. Mr. A.Bishop  I thought that the manufacture of genuine Clark's shoes had ceased some years ago as all I have seen in their shops, for some time now, has been ""street market"" quality footwear. Joanne USA  How sad!! I am sorry but the quality of out sourcing is just not the same!!!When will we learn. The Clarks made in England were the best and the new ones are not!! lorraine  clarks is the making of street. without the clarks famly it would not be the same. this was such a stupid idea to move from somerset to the far east. no wonder the quality of clarks shoes is not as good as it was Dorothy Green  I bought my first pair of Clarks Shoes in Norfolk, Nebraska at Brown's Shoe Store. I fell in love with the quality and fit. Since then I have continued to buy Clarks, however, the last pair I bought, approximately 2 l/2 years ago, and worn very little, have actually fallen apart. I purchased them from Dillards in Temple, Texas. I am very disappointed in the quality and will probably switch to another brand of shoes. John Robertson Veganline.com  I run a shoe shop and have tried to get Clarks to make my stuff to order for a long time. Answer always no. Big orders for their shop franchise or nothing.Now Mr Stables of Softwalker in Cumbria has bought the machinary and taken-on some of the staff from Clarks' canvas shoe factory - proabably this one - and is making all kinds of things with a minimum wholesale order of 12 pairs if you collect. He'll even make a single pair if you want to recycle your jeans into sandals. They're not massively expensive and of course he saves the massive admin costs of importing from the far east.I sell his sandals on my web site and a lot of other niche shops are selling the same thing. It turns out that a lot of people really want to buy fairtrade and European-made shoes, whatever the big companies say. Kathy  I hate to see this. Now I understand why I can't find a replacement pair of my favorite sandal, 'Clover' by Clarks and why I am seeing so many negative comments about the fit of Clarks shoes at different retailers. Good luck to all the former employees. Adrian Brittlebank  Yet another kick in the teeth for UK production. What do we actually still make in this country which won't be transferred to China? Joel Ramirez  To be honest they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Herman Riley Stein  I bought my first Clark's shoe, the Sandel, in 1946, in Los Angeles. I don't know where they were made..My next pair, a few years later were made in India and they were no to good..I bought another pair and they were made in Mexico and they were very good.....Then I couldn't get anymore. I had a Cobbler, in the State of Nebraska, take apart my Mexican pair and reproduce a new pair for me...They are still wearable...My Cobbler died and I can't find another in the USA. Do you still have Cobbles in the UK? I am now 85 years old and I would like to die with my Sandals on. One note, I AM SICK OF BUYING ALL CHINA...It is getting difficult to find a ""Made in USA""....Thanks for the space...hrs cARLEY AND ARABELLA  OUR VIEW IS THAT SOON EVERY THING WILL START TO BE MADE IN THE FAR EAST DUE TO THE CHEAPER LABOUR COSTS! WE NEED TO START LOOKING FUTHER INTO THIS ISSUE AND SOLVE IT QUICKLY! Renee  I've always loved Clarks and here in the U.S. were one of the few offering narrow sizing. I have noticed negative changes the last couple of years and now know why. I'm not buying anymore. bob brooks  Living in NZ now but originally from Axbridge, Somerset. Isn't globalization wonderful. Bob Manning  What is happening in SOmerset is happening all over the world. China and far eastern countries have a lower wage base and we cannot compete. Western countries would have to STOP buying all goods produced outside their country if any manufacturing is to continue in their country. China will flood the market with cheap produce and we will become Third world. Western companies are having their produces made in China, so that they can keep their heads above water. There is not enough pride or investment in our own countries to allow manufacturing to continue. Where does Somerset's futre lie. May be you can gro grass and manufacture cheese. I hear that Chinese cheese isn't that available Valerie King  This is a sad day for Britain. I love Clark's shoes, my favorites. And going to Street to buy bargains has been a part of my trips to England. I will still buy Clarks but I feel badly to see shoe manufacturing leaving both England and the United States. Alastair  I'm not surprised at this announcement and wonder why we even think of Clarks as a local business any more! Glenn Wallis  I think Clarks will regret closing their UK factories. Clarks is a British Brand and at least some if its shoes should be made here! The foreign produced shoes do not offer the same quality, it is corporate greed striking again. I will no longer shop at Clarks and I urge people in Somerset and the rest of the UK to question where their shoes are produced. Vietnam and China the main areas for Clarks new shoe production are not as ethically aware as the UK. Buy shoes online and buy British :) A.Mathur  There is no doubt that the price of shoes will remain the same and the only losers will be the workers in the Clarks factory, and the sweated labourers the managers will employ, on a ""contracted out"" manufacturing process. Everyone will be happy because the exploitation will be hidden by the distance of China from here. This is disgusting and I shall ensure that my family and friends do not buy any products with the Clarks label. Rod Harrison  Dismayed to see news of closure.I would suggest too high managemement costs and unnecessary expensive office buildings.Do we expect to see much reduced prices in view of cheaper labour costs and will quality slip? Anna Ashby  I will be moving to the area very soon. I think that this could have been foreseen. Perhaps a 'buy British' type promotion could have helped? Anyway, it is a really great shame. A F Wallace  Companies like Clarks do not care about the prosperity of the County or it's workforce. The bottom line is 'profit'. These companies moan about the increasing cost of running businesses in this country so they move overseas to countries that have lower overheads and cheeper labour however do they reflect this in the prices of their products made in these countries ?, of course not. 'Dyson' is a fine example of this. Since he moved his business to the Far East his products have gone up in price and Clarks shoes will be just the same. I refuse to buy products from such companies and I believe that more people should do the same. amanda chivers  The cost of making the shoes are said to be cheaper.But why are the price still going up.

703,"You are renowned for being able to ad lib for most of a stand up show. Do you look to the audience for inspiration? Im not a big fan of shows that are just sort of reading off a script. I have an idea of what I want to talk about. If somebody says something or catches my eye and theyre interesting, Ill kind of like talk to them and make friends. Whatever happens there becomes one of the threads that weaves through the show. Have you ever encountered an audience that just weren't interesting? I did a gig in South Africa in a theatre in Cape Town and they were probably the most sort of reserved crowd. They just werent up for it. I think its 'cos they dont have any history of stand-up comedy and it was a bit kind of weird for them, yknow. They were just sat there going ""oh this isnt theatre."" ""Everyone I talked to just looked away, like I'd committed some sort of hideous crime."" (Real, 28K) What did you do with that audience? I sat on the side of the stage because I was on there going ""Right then, la da da..."" I was talking to this woman and she was just ignoring me and I was going ""Im talking to you."" She just wouldnt make eye contact with me. I actually stood right in front of her and said ""Im saying hello, Im not meaning you any harm,"" and she still wouldnt make contact so I went to talk to somebody else - nothing. Everyone I went to talk to just looked away, like Id committed some sort of hideous crime. So I sort of sat on the edge of the stage and talked about the fact that they were basically being a bunch of ****s and the laughter came from that. By the end of the night everyone was rolling about. You sound like a naturally friendly bloke whos interested in people. Are you like that in real life or do you go to the other extreme? I am a naturally friendly person but I have a bit of a snapping point if I think people are taking liberties. I do quite like getting into conversation with random strangers, but I also do like disappearing into my own head and I do get quite annoyed if Im just trying to daydream a bit and its interrupted. Do you get up and tell them? Does the comedian persona take over? Yes very much so. Yknow if youre sitting in a nice quite bar and somebody puts on the jukebox and then turns it up really loud? That just drives me mad. So what are we going to see from you in the future? A show called 'mind your own business and speak quietly'? I think be considerate to others would be the thing. Id quite like to fly a kite in the city centre, but I dont. Whats going to be your next move? As soon as it finishes Ive got a day off, then I go to Australia and New Zealand. Then Fiji is my next. Then Im going to be doing various gigs around the place in the summer. Im doing Regents Park and playing the outdoor gigs there - you know where they usually do the Shakspeare. Then off to the Edinburgh festival and the West End and then touring again. You did actually study performing arts didnt you. Given that your comedy is very natural and improvised, do you think its something that you can learn? No I dont think you can, youve either got it in you or you havent. That course that I did was the equivalent of an A Level, it was a 6th form college. And that was quite interesting. I realised when I did that - I went to my careers teacher and said ""I want to be a comedian"" and the teacher said ""okay then, why dont you go to college and do a performing arts course. It wasnt till I got there that I just sort of realised they were teaching all the different names for curtains, what was stage right and stage left and stuff. But in terms of it having any effect on the standup - no. You can go on a course and somebody can tell you to hold the mic like this. Somebody can tell you the way plays work and it doesnt make you a great actor. Youre either funny or youre not.    <<Back to Page 1"
704,"Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell has insisted the removal of manager Lee Bradbury was ""best for the club"".  The Cherries announced they had parted company with Bradbury on Sunday, the day after defeat at Oldham saw them slip to 13th in League One.  Mitchell told BBC Radio Solent: ""Lee and I spent a considerable time on Sunday morning talking and we couldn't conclude together.  ""I wish Lee a great future and I'm sure our paths will cross again.""  Mitchell refused to confirm whether youth team manager Paul Groves and head of youth Shaun Brooks, whom the club had announced would take charge until the end of the season, would remain in control beyond tomorrow's match against Stevenage.  However in a separate press conference held on Monday afternoon, Groves said he had been told he would be in charge until the end of the season.  He also said Bradbury had rejected Mitchell's proposal that Groves and Brooks assist his work with the first team.  Mitchell also declined to comment on the future of Bradbury's assistant Russ Wilcox and coach Ryan Garry.  The club later published a statement on their website saying Wilcox had been placed on gardening leave for a fortnight, following which he would ""return to the Seward Stadium to discuss his future"".  Groves said Garry would continue to work as first team coach.  Mitchell added: ""As you know, Lee has had 100% support from me from day one and that's never changed. I don't want to comment on other people.""  Asked whether he had taken the decision together with Russian co-owner Maxim Demin, Mitchell responded: ""That's too much detail. It's just the case that there is a change and really that's as much as I'd like to say.  ""I just don't really feel it's my place to comment on where we are in the league. As far as I'm concerned the situation is as it is.""  The loss at Oldham on Saturday was Bournemouth's sixth defeat in eight games.  Bradbury, 36, took over as manager when Eddie Howe left for Burnley in January 2011, and guided the club to the League One play-off semi-finals last term, where they lost to Huddersfield on penalties.  Only last week Mitchell claimed he was happy with the club's current position in League One and believed they were making progress.  Bournemouth made a slow start this season, but rose up the table around the festive period before Bradbury signed a contract extension until 2015 in January."
705,"Paul Rowley has resigned as Leigh Centurions head coach 10 days before the start of the 2016 Championship season.  The 40-year-old took over in 2012 and has guided Leigh to the Championship title in each of the past two years.  They won just one game in The Qualifiers in 2015 as they missed out on a place in Super League.  ""It is with a heavy heart I have decided to resign as coach,"" said Rowley in a statement.  ""My reasons for leaving are personal and I will not comment further in public or in private."""
