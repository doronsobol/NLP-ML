0,"Angle-grinder Man - a self-proclaimed superhero - patrols by night looking for unhappy drivers who have been clamped and then sets their cars free.  He promises to take on clamping firms, speed cameras and the congestion charge on behalf of drivers.  An odd-job man by day, he claims to operate in Kent during the week and in London at weekends.  On calling, an answer phone message invites callers to ""leave a message after the grinding sound"".  The unnamed man, who wears a costume of gold boots and crotch-hugging pants over a blue leotard, said he was happy to take the risk.  ""It's a public service,"" he says on his website.  ""I for one am prepared to fight for what is fair and am making myself available to the public.  ""I may not be able to single-handedly and totally cast off the repressive shackles of a corrupt government - but I can cut off your wheel-clamps for you.""  He says he decided to go ""full-time vigilante"" in May this year.  ""My obsession with wheel-clamping is actually a rebellion against a much deeper malaise,"" he said.  ""Namely, the arrogant contempt that politicians hold for the people who put them into power, and whom they claim to represent.""  A Kent Police spokeswoman said no complaint about wheel clamps being cut off had been made by either a clamping firm or a member of the public.  A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said they could not investigate unless a crime was reported."
1,"Jacob Zuma's advisers say he has nothing to hide South Africa's opposition leader has called for an investigation into whether President Jacob Zuma has broken the government's strict ethics code. This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "
2,"A staple of classic rock and oldies radio stations, the song 'House of the Rising Sun', recorded in 1964 by the British band The Animals, relates the story of a young boy led into a life of misery at a house of prostitution or gambling in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Was there ever really a place called 'House of the Rising Sun' in New Orleans? It depends on who you ask.  First, let's examine the song. The Animals recorded their version for EMI Records in just one take, during a stopover on an American tour with rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry. Upon release, it was immediately successful and became the band's first big hit, peaking at number one in the UK singles charts in July 1964. The song went on to be released in America, and in August of that year, during the height of the so-called 'British Invasion' it topped the American singles charts for three weeks. The song sold over a million copies in just five weeks in the USA alone.  While this version has become a pop icon of the 1960s, it's hardly the first recording of the song. The earliest recorded version dates back to 1932 by Clarence 'Tom' Ashley as 'Rising Sun Blues', and it was recorded again in 1934 by The Callahan Brothers as 'Rounder's Luck'. With the evolution of folk music in the 1940s and 1950s, the song went through numerous incarnations, by such notable singers as Josh White, Huddie 'Leadbelly' Ledbetter, Pete Seeger and Woodie Guthrie. As the 1960s rolled around, both Joan Baez and Bob Dylan made a stab at recording the song.  The song's origins are somewhat curious. The original melody resembles an arrangement of 'Matty Groves', a traditional English ballad, but the lyrics appear to have ties to the hills of the American South.  In 1937 Alan Lomax , an American folklorist, was travelling the United States to record and preserve American traditional folk music. In Middlesboro, Kentucky he met 16-year-old Georgia Turner, a dirt-poor miner's daughter, who he recorded singing a song she called 'Rising Sun Blues'. Miss Turner could not remember where she had learned the song, other than from the front porches of her parents' and grandparents' homes in the small rural town. Indeed, according to an Associated Press article by Ted Anthony dated 16 September, 2000, the lyrics are traditional:  Although Lomax recorded two other versions of the song before leaving Kentucky, it was the Georgia Turner version that he included in his 1941 compilation songbook Our Singing Country, and he gave her the songwriting credit, along with 'several stanzas by Bert Martin'.  There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.    It's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me, O God, for one. If I had listened what Mama said, I'd be at home today.    Being so young and foolish, poor boy, let a rambler lead me astray. Go tell my baby sister never do like I have done    To shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun. My mother she's a tailor, she sewed these new blue jeans.    My sweetheart, he's a drunkard, Lord, Lord, drinks down in New Orleans. The only thing a drunkard needs is a suitcase and a trunk.    The only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk. Fills his glasses to the brim, passes them around.    Only pleasure he gets out of life is hoboin' from town to town. One foot is on the platform and the other one on the train.    I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain. Going back to New Orleans, my race is almost run.    Going back to spend the rest of my days beneath that Rising Sun.  Was there ever really such a place in New Orleans that inspired the lyrics to this song? In the late 18th Century and most of the 19th Century, as well as today, prostitution and backroom gambling was illegal . It's probable that places where these activities went on didn't publicly advertise their trade. Did establishments such as these exist at that time in New Orleans? Without a doubt. New Orleans is a port city, located at the mouth of the Mississippi River, and merchants and sailors who were far away from home were constantly streaming in and out. In 1862, during the American Civil War, the Confederate Army in New Orleans surrendered the city and it fell into Union occupation, thus leaving many northern homesick soldiers in want of comfort and entertainment.  In the history of New Orleans, there have been several business establishments that bore the name Rising Sun. Without help of public advertising of brothels or gambling houses, it is difficult to determine if the House of the Rising Sun existed, or perhaps as was the custom, this term was used as one of many euphemisms to describe houses conducting illicit business.  There is a house located at number 826-830 St Louis Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans which is current owners claim is the famed, former House of the Rising Sun Brothel, originally run by a Madam named Marianne LeSoliel Levant (whose surname translates from French into 'Rising Sun'), from 1862 through 1874. The owners, however, can offer no solid proof of this claim.  Newspaper advertisements in 1838 also mention a Rising Sun Coffee House on Decatur Street in the city, but this establishment never had a claim of fame as a brothel or gambling hall, and it is no longer in existence.  There was a Rising Sun Hall in the 1890s, which served as a 'benevolent association' hall; it booked dances and rented rooms to musicians. These halls and clubs were the very birthplace of jazz. It is conceivable that prostitution and gambling occurred in the backrooms of these halls, with the constant transience of travelling musicians. This is purely speculation though, as no oral or written history exists about these goings-on.  In the early 1800s there was The Rising Sun Hotel, located on Conti Street in the heart of the French Quarter. During its time of operation, the hotel was sold to new owners. In January 1821, an advertisement for the hotel in the Louisiana Gazette states the new owners will 'maintain the character of giving the best entertainment, which this house has enjoyed for 20 years past. Gentlemen may here rely upon finding attentive Servants. The bar will be supplied with genuine good Liquors; and the Table, the fare will be of the best the market or the season will afford'. Although the advert does not prove that anything illicit was happening at The Rising Sun, it suggests it was a place where men went for a good time. In 1822, the hotel burned to the ground, and was never rebuilt.  In 2005 this site was excavated by archaeologists in search of ancient Native American artefacts, and some interesting things were unearthed, making the former hotel 'look impressively like a bordello', according to Shannon Dawdy, the lead archaeologist. Dawdy cited finding combinations of broken pieces of 'tons of liquor bottles' and several rouge pots .  So, does any of this prove there was an actual brothel named The House of the Rising Sun in New Orleans? According to Pamela D Arceneaux, a well-respected research librarian who works at the Williams Research Center in New Orleans and helps maintain the Historic New Orleans Collection, er... no. She is quoted in numerous articles as saying on the subject:  Yes, maybe.    Maybe, lyrics are just lyrics."
3,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
4,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
5,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Hiroshi Yanagihara cannot forget the day he was forced to confess to a crime he did not commit. A taxi driver, he had been detained on suspicion of attempted rape. The police interrogation was so relentless, he says, that it brought him to the brink of suicide. ""When I first started saying I was innocent the intimidation and the pressure on me grew stronger,"" he said. ""They kept saying, 'Your family is giving up on you, they're very disappointed in you.' They kept repeating over and over. Mr Yanagihara spent two years in jail for a crime he was later cleared of ""I got to the stage of there's really nothing I can do about this. Anything I say they're not going to listen to, there's nothing I can do. I just said yes, one word yes. That led them to arrest me."" That confession was enough to see Hiroshi Yanagihara convicted and spend more than two years behind bars, even though a footprint at the scene did not match his shoe size. He was only cleared after he was released, when another man was found guilty of the crime. His is one of several high-profile cases of forced confessions in Japan. Amnesty International has now called on Japan's new government to immediately implement reforms of the police interrogation system to avoid such miscarriages of justice. Suspects can be held for up to 23 days before they are charged in what the campaign group says is a brutal system that has no place in modern Japan. The conviction rate is more than 99%, often based on confessions. Amnesty International says some are extracted from suspects under duress. In its manifesto the Democratic Party, which won a general election in August, pledged to introduce full videotaping of interrogations. Japan's courts have a conviction rate of more than 99% - although it cannot be compared directly to other countries because there is no plea bargaining. At the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did?    Prosecutors usually proceed with a case only if they are sure they will win and a confession has been called the king of evidence. ""The detainee has absolutely no access to his defence lawyers, has no idea how long the interrogation session would go,"" said Rajiv Narayan of Amnesty International. ""And this also involves many, many hours of repeated questions and sometimes sleep deprivation, and where the detainee is given the impression he would only be released once he confesses. ""In that kind of system, what's of great concern is the confessions extracted could even be used to sentence a person to death."" Amnesty International says it is impossible to know how many miscarriages of justice there have been. A British man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC about his experience of police detention in Japan. ""The first thing I was told, and this was by the officers, was you're going to hell with your eyes open,"" he said. The man had been caught trying to smuggle two kilograms of cannabis into Japan. He admits his guilt, but claims he was interrogated for up to 16 hours a day for weeks on end as officers tried to get him to confess to further crimes. He says he was handcuffed, tied with a rope to his chair and not allowed to use the toilet. Every day he was presented with papers in Japanese, which he did not understand, and told to sign them. Each time he refused, he says, things got worse. ""He says to me, 'Just co-operate and you'll find things will be just co-operate with him',"" the man said. ""He wanted me to agree that I'd brought marijuana to Japan before, I'm in a gang. They started shouting at me. They tried to force me to sign the papers. They put one inmate in my cell and he started to do all the kung fu like he was going to attack me."" The police and the Ministry of Justice were unable to respond to these particular allegations because the charity representing the prisoner wants to maintain his anonymity with a view to future compensation. However, they were prepared to discuss the case of Hiroshi Yanagihara, wrongly convicted of attempted rape. ""Regarding this case the prosecutor's office investigated the problems in August 2007 to prevent it happening again,"" said Ministry of Justice spokesman Yoshio Nakamura. ""They released the report. And we believe the report will be used in order to prevent it from happening again."" Trial by jury has just been introduced in Japan, and campaigners hope it will cast light on the justice system. But Amnesty International says this is not enough. They are calling on Japan's new government to immediately fulfil an election pledge to videotape interrogations to stop abuses in police detention. There is no commitment to reduce the length of time suspects can be held by police. ""Wrongful convictions should not happen, and I hope they won't in the future,"" said Keiko Chiba, the new minister of justice. ""People in the justice system and politicians knew there was a problem and were concerned. ""But at the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did? And they thought there's no way the investigators would do such a thing. That's why it didn't come to changing it as much as it should have done.""     "
6,"In any crisis, there are facts, rumours and lies. The challenge facing Birmingham is to work out which is which in the wake of clashes between the city's black and Asian communities.  The story started when a pirate radio station DJ aired allegations that a black teenage girl had been gang raped by Asian men in a beauty shop near to the Lozells area.  Anger mounted and a public picket outside followed. By the weekend, with no victim having come forward, the mood was sufficiently heated for the police to try to start calming things down.  But by Saturday night, violence hit Lozells' streets as gangs took matters into their own hands. Young black men attacked Asian businesses; Asian youths attacked the black men; both gangs had a go at the police.  Who killed Isiah Young-Sam, a city council IT analyst returning home from the cinema, remains unclear as the police have not publicly confirmed the ethnicity of the mob behind the vicious stabbing.  After a second night of trouble saw more tension (and a fatal shooting that may or may not be related), the police swamped Lozells on Monday to stamp out the trouble.  Warren G, the DJ who aired the rape allegation, has kept quiet. The woman screening his calls told the BBC News website that he had only sought to do the right thing.  Ajaib Hussein, the owner of the beauty parlour at the centre of the allegation, has denied the claims and said his business is the victim of a plot by rivals.  What's clear is that Lozells is rife with rumour and paranoia. There are stories of black gangs coming in from Nottingham to attack Asian businesses. Pakistani men are supposedly coming down from Bradford to prepare their response.  Then there are the rumours that this is really about a tawdry war for street influence between rival black gangs who have allegedly united to use minor community differences to escalate racial tension.  ""There is going to have to be a lot of hard work to rebuild relations,"" said Maxie Hayles, Birmingham's veteran and outspoken racism campaigner.  ""A conflict that has been growing for some time between the African Caribbean community and the Asian community has finally come to the surface.  ""It was going to come out sooner or later. There are a lot of [black] people who think that the Asian people look down on African-Caribbean people. People don't want to talk about this because they think it plays into the hands of right-wing extremists. But if you don't talk about it, then this is what happens.""  Birmingham is certainly a patchwork of communities. But the city's story is not of segregation and tension. If anything it has long been an example of natural integration.  It has twice the national average proportion of mixed-race children - kids born into relationships that stitch together this patchwork.  Even amid this week's events, that mixing is obvious. One of area's DJs who has defended the pirate stations is a Sikh man whose partner is a black woman. Down Lozells Road itself you see black and Asian people talking and shopping.  But what is also clear is that change appears to have made some people nervous - and that has heightened tensions and differences in Lozells, an extremely deprived area.  Some members of the long-established black communities appear to feel the most nervous, not least because some people in an area as diverse as this believe they are in competition with other communities for meagre resources.  On Lozells Road, you see the economic success of Asian communities. Shop after shop - grocers, chippies, sari sellers and newsagents - stand testament to a community's ability to pull together. While this is by no means an exclusively Muslim area, a new mosque is a symbol of success.  But very few businesses here are owned by black people, even though many of the customers are black. Asian shopkeepers say that if the allegations of rape remain unsubstantiated, it can surely be no coincidence that the location for the crime was an Asian-owned beauty parlour.  One Pakistani kebab shop owner said he had suffered a week of abuse by a gang who had kept away on Monday only because of the heavy police presence. He told the BBC the gang had returned night after night to threaten him, before smashing a window.  ""We're good at what we do,"" he told the BBC. ""I've got no problem with black people, everyone is my customer - and they [black youths] don't like it. If they continue to do it, then the Asian youth will come out on the streets again.""  'Them and us'  Guffraz Farid, manager of a large grocery in Lozells, said that the violence had hit takings in one of his busiest weeks of the year - the run-up to the Muslim festival of Eid.  The local traders' association had agreed to shut their stores for an hour on Saturday as a mark of solidarity. Then, he said, a gang of young black men started threatening shop keepers and that, in turn, had prompted young Asian men to go out on to the streets.  ""I'm just not going to risk it,"" he said. ""I have 17 people working here and it's not worth staying open late if lives are at risk. We will be shutting early.""  Maxie Hayles says a ""them and us"" of economic success and failure in Birmingham has been ""swept under the carpet for too long"".  ""Until we face up to these issues, we will not be able to solve them. The reality is that the African Caribbean community don't have the money - they don't have the corner shops, the newsagents or even the jobs in these places.""  This is a view that you hear a lot. One West Midlands race equality official, Derek Campbell, told the BBC that some black people were saying they had been ""re-colonised"" by successful Asian communities, an allusion to slavery and empire.  ""They see money going into Asian communities because, let's face it, the Asian communities have been good at working together to get it,"" said Mr Campbell. ""Are we going to blame the Asians because they have got their act together? I think not. There are challenges that the black communities need to face up to."""
7,"Singer Sir Cliff Richard will face no further action over allegations of historical sex abuse, prosecutors say.  The Crown Prosecution Service said it had decided there was ""insufficient evidence to prosecute"".  Sir Cliff said he was ""obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close"".  But he said his naming by the media, despite not being charged, meant he had been ""hung out like live bait"".  Four men claimed offences took place between 1958 and 1983, the CPS said.  It is understood that one of the complainants intends to use the Victims' Right to Review Scheme to appeal against the decision not to bring charges.  In a statement, Sir Cliff said: ""I have always maintained my innocence, co-operated fully with the investigation, and cannot understand why it has taken so long to get to this point.""  He criticised the ""high-profile fumbling of my case from day one"".  ""Other than in exceptional cases, people who are facing allegations should never be named publicly until charged,"" he said.  ""I was named before I was even interviewed and for me that was like being hung out like 'live bait'.  ""It is obvious that such strategies simply increase the risk of attracting spurious claims which not only tie up police resources and waste public funds, but they forever tarnish the reputations of innocent people.""  Sir Cliff Richard's anger, mixed with relief, seeps from every line of his 366-word statement. The phrase ""hung out like live bait"" stands out - and it's designed to.  Sir Cliff wants to stop the reputations of other people being tarnished by publicity about allegations that haven't crossed the threshold for a prosecution, let alone been proven.  Although it's not police practice to identify suspects who haven't been charged - unless there are exceptional circumstances - names occasionally leak out and journalists sometimes discover the details through other routes.  A statutory ban on naming would put a stop to that. But would it allow sex offenders to get away with their crimes?  The concern is that if they hadn't been named in the media at an early stage, thereby emboldening other victims to come forward, some recently convicted celebrities would have got away with it.  Last year an independent investigation concluded that South Yorkshire Police should not have released ""highly confidential"" information to the BBC about a planned search of Sir Cliff Richard's home.  BBC film crews, including one in a helicopter, filmed the raid in August 2014.  In a statement, South Yorkshire Police apologised ""wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused"" to Sir Cliff by the force's ""initial handling of the media interest"" in its investigation.  The investigation is estimated to have cost ""in the region of £800,000"" including staffing costs, the force added.  ""Non-recent allegations are, by their very nature, complex and difficult matters to investigate and can take a considerable amount of time,"" it said.  ""We appreciate that waiting for a conclusion will undoubtedly have caused additional distress. However, it is in the interests of justice to investigate such matters thoroughly.""  Prosecutors received the full evidence file from police on 10 May, and BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said that meant the CPS had made its decision ""quite quickly"".  But he said the CPS had been working alongside the police for many months and there would now be ""serious questions for the police about why this has taken so long"".  He also said there would be ""serious questions for the BBC in terms of its coverage"".  Commenting on the claims against Sir Cliff, our correspondent said this ""isn't necessarily the end of the matter"", as the CPS maintains it must ""keep every case under review"" and every complainant has the right to a review of a decision not to bring charges - as one has said he will.  Responding to questions about the BBC's coverage, a BBC spokesman said: ""We applied normal editorial judgements to a story that was covered widely by all media and have continued to report the investigation as it developed including the CPS's decision today - which is running prominently across our news output.""  Conservative MP David Davis said Sir Cliff's case was ""another high-profile arrest which resulted in no prosecution"".  ""It is time for a complete review of police procedures surrounding high-profile sex abuse cases, and the publicity surrounding these cases,"" he said.  ""Whilst it is important to protect victims and maximise the chances of a successful prosecution, this must not result in the gratuitous destruction of people's reputation.""  Broadcaster and campaigner Nick Ross agreed with Sir Cliff's comment that he was ""hung out like live bait"".  He said police faced an ""impossible dilemma"" trying to balance justice for victims with ""trying not to have a witch hunt against people, some of whom are celebrities"".  But he said police did not handle Sir Cliff's case correctly, both in terms of Sir Cliff's name being released and by taking ""so long"" over the investigation.  Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck said he had not expected the CPS to come to any other decision when it came to his friend.  Tarbuck was released without charge in 2014 after his arrest over allegations of historical child sex abuse.  He said: ""I have known this man since we were 19 years of age, that's a long time, and I knew him then as a nice fellow.  ""I can tell you so many things about him, he's a decent human being. And why keep him waiting all this long?"""
8,"The latest two sub-kiloton tests were carried out on the Pokhran range in the Rajasthan desert at 1221 Indian Standard Time (0621 GMT).  The statement said that the tests were fully contained and there was no release of radioactivity into the atmosphere.  The statement added that the government of India reiterated its offer of considering to adhere to some of the undertakings in the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty under the framework of the proposals in a statement made on May 11.  The BBC Delhi correspondent says that supported by public opinion, the Indian Government is confident it can deal with the consequences.  The opposition Congress party in India has criticised the government for carrying out the series of nuclear tests.  Party spokesman, Salman Khursheed, accused the governing Bharatiya Janta Party of trying to use the tests for political ends rather than to enhance the country's national security.  Mr Khursheed said the government had failed to clearly explain why the tests were necessary.  President Clinton has signed documents imposing sanctions against India for conducting the nuclear testing programme. American officials say that full details will be announced later.  Pakistan says India 'has gone berserk'  Pakistan has bitterly condemned the latest Indian tests. The Pakistani Foreign Minister, Gohar Ayub Khan, said that the Indian leadership seemed to have gone ""berserk"" and was acting in a totally unrestrained way.  Japan has suspended its 3.5bn yen annual grant aid to India in protest at New Delhi's first round of testing.  The spokesman for the BJP, the dominant party in India's coalition government, IK Malkani, stood by the decision and attacked American ""hypocrisy"" in imposing sanctions.  He also denied that his party was making political capital out of grassroots support for the tests. ""For 30 years, our party has been urging that India should go nuclear and now that we have the power and the opportunity we have gone nuclear - that's all,"" he told BBC World Television.  On Monday, the Indian Government moved to counter widespread international criticism it incurred after conducting its first three nuclear tests.  The Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee wrote to leaders of the world's major powers to explain the reasons for the tests."

10,"1993: Recession over - it's official The government has reacted with relief to news that Britain's economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months of this year, and declared the longest recession since the 1930s officially over. The government has reacted with relief to news that Britain's economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months of this year, and declared the longest recession since the 1930s officially over. The figures, from the Central Statistical Office, show a 0.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP), and a 0.6% increase in activity in the onshore economy, excluding oil and gas production. It's the first sign of growth in the economy for over two years. The recession has been longer, but less severe, than the last one in the 1980s. Output has fallen by 3.9%, compared with a 5.5% fall last time. The economy is recovering across a broad front   Prime Minister John Major called on industry to make the most of the ""unparalleled opportunities"" offered by the combination of low inflation and interest rates, and a competitive exchange rate. The Chancellor, Norman Lamont, was also upbeat, saying the figures were ""the best evidence so far that the economy is recovering across a broad front."" In a BBC interview, Mr Lamont said Britain was starting to see the reward of policies that the government had been pursuing during the past few years. The Institute of Directors, though, disagreed with the Chancellor on the reasons for the upturn. Their latest survey said improved performance was due to Britain's departure from the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM), a policy decision forced on the government. The pound was driven out of the ERM last September by frantic currency speculation, on what became known as Black Wednesday. In a catastrophic day for the government's policy on Europe and the economy, Mr Lamont was forced to spend billions in an attempt to prop up the pound, which failed as it dropped below its minimum level in the ERM. He had no choice but to devalue and pull out of the ERM. The Shadow Chancellor, Gordon Brown, greeted the figures cautiously, saying he hoped the recession was over, but warning that skills shortages and an investment gap with the UK's competitors could stymie future growth.  The British economy began improving steadily, and has not been in recession since. Norman Lamont's career, however, never fully recovered from Black Wednesday. A month after announcing the end of the recession, he had resigned. In his resignation speech to the Commons, he launched a vitriolic attack on John Major's leadership. Famously, he accused the government of being ""in office, but not in power"". He never spoke to John Major again, and became one of his fiercest critics from the backbenches. The Black Wednesday debacle is also credited with destroying confidence in the Conservatives' ability to manage the economy. It contributed to their defeat in the 1997 general election. John Major refused to include his former Chancellor in his resignation honours list in 1997. Mr Lamont was made a peer by John Major's successor, Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, in 1998.   "
11,"                           The West End stage brought yuletide imagination to Regent Street in 1994 When Christmas lights were frirst switched on in Central London, they were such a great attraction they inspired an unsuccessful attempt in the House of Lords to bring action against those responsible for causing chaos and obstruction. Regent Street first lit up in 1954. Prompted by an article in the Daily Telegraph commenting on how drab London looked at Christmas, the retailers and businesses which made up the Regent Street Association organised and financed the first display. Oxford Street and its corresponding Association followed suit in 1959. The recession of the late1960s hit London's centre at Christmas. The lights went out in Oxford Street in 1967 and four years later Regent Street also succumbed. In 1978, financial and electronic power was restored. The resulting laser show devised by Oxford Street was a brave attempt but deemed a little too dangerous. 1979 saw the resumption of normal practices and since then funding has always been a contentious issue. In some years Regent Street has seen interesting varieties as the lights take inspiration from their sponsor. Disney's Aladdin and Cameron Mackintosh's Celebration of West End Musicals have starred. But, for the last three years, we've had Flashing Crowns with Stars in Regent Street and a hotch potch of Christmas motifs in Oxford Street. Other incidents of note, aside from the comings and goings of the funding saga, have been the fall of an 18-inch electric candle from its fitting over Oxford Street in 1959. It happened again later that same year, but this time the falling article was 15ft long and this time it caused a death. In 1963, the lighting up of London was postponed as a mark of respect to the recently assassinated John F Kennedy. And in 1989, the great switch on in Oxford Street bowed to the power of pop celebrity, waiting several weeks past its usual mid-November date for Kylie Minogue to make a window in her hectic schedule. Frankie and Pete follow in a long line of celebrity sparklers Despite the controversy, the lighting ceremony remains a matter of national interest and celebrity aspiration. To be invited to be chief switch thrower in Oxford Street means you are currently the people's favourite, take pop stars the Spice Girls and Peter Andre for example. And in Regent Street, the lucky candidate joins a long line of Royals and choice notables such as former Prime Minister, John Major, and champion jockey Frankie Detorri. Electric stars may now be no competition for the human kind but the annual illumination of London continues to be an integral part of the country's Christmas preparations.                    [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive]"
12,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

14,"The event was held at the Old Rep Theatre in Birmingham Scientists have uncorked the ""greatest smell on earth"" at the British Science Festival in Birmingham. At least that was what the audience on Wednesday evening was expecting. In fact, it was part of a psychological experiment looking at how we all react to authority and the pressures of conformity. The audience arrived at the Old Rep Theatre in Birmingham to the strains of a string quartet. And then as the lights darkened, Jon Wood, from Aston University, took to a stage surrounded by all the paraphernalia of an authentic scientific lecture. Mr Wood explained to us all about the science of smell, noses and genes - from the scent of baking bread to the smells plants give off when they are under attack by insects. Members of the audience were given small keypads, so they could register the strength of the ""greatest smell on earth"" when it was finally revealed. Mr Wood went to great lengths to build up a convincing description of the smell. Members of the audience were asked to raise their hands He explained that it came from a newly-discovered plant and showed a fake video of the plant apparently growing in a rainforest. And when the ""extract"" of the smelly and made-up plant in question, Dulcis Foetidus, finally arrived at the theatre, it was carried in by a hefty-looking security guard. Finally the moment came when the smell would be uncorked. Members of the audience were asked to raise their hands and also register on their keypads when they started to detect the distinctive whiff of Dulcis Foetidus wafting from the uncorked phial of liquid. In fact, the liquid was sterile water which has no smell at all. Soon small pockets of people in the audience began to raise their arms. In the end about a quarter of the members of the audience said they could smell something with half of them aged under 18. Not bad for a scientifically-literate audience perhaps more alert than most to smelling something fishy. After it was all over, Mr Wood was happy with the result. ""It comes down to the psychology of conformity. If one person puts their hand up, that starts to spread around the theatre."" Those people who said they smelt something could not believe there was nothing more than water in the small phial of liquid. In the end we did not learn much about the ""greatest smell on earth"". But we did learn a lot about people.     "

19,"At its simplest, journalism is about telling people things they don't know. So when the Ministry of Defence approached the BBC - along with other parts of the UK media - to ask us not to tell our audiences about a possible deployment of Prince Harry to Afghanistan, it was something we thought long and hard about.  A news black-out is unusual, but not unique. An agreement exists between the police and the media over the reporting of kidnaps - the police have the right to request that media organisations don't report an abduction while negotiations are under way, in case it makes the release of the hostage more difficult; in return, they accept the responsibility to update the media regularly and reveal the full story, on camera, once the situation has been resolved. When lives are at risk, it's not always helpful to have things played out in the glare of publicity.  Last summer - on the day my colleague Alan Johnston was released in Gaza - the Chief of the General Staff, Sir Richard Dannatt, met editors to make the case for a voluntary agreement. He was very candid; Harry wanted a career in the Army and he needed to be able to be deployed to do what he'd been trained to do, even if it was just for a day.  After five months of discussions, using the kidnap agreement as our model, the MoD and the UK media reached an understanding; we wouldn't speculate or report on the prince's deployments to minimise the danger to him and to others. In return, we'd get access to him before, during and after his time in Afghanistan. It was a voluntary agreement - any of the organisations could have decided to leave at any time. We - and the other UK broadcasters and newspapers - were clear that we would not report his deployment.  So, for the past ten weeks, the BBC, ITV and Sky News have been filming with Prince Harry - the first time we've been up close and personal with him. We interviewed him at Clarence House in mid-December, just before he was sent to Afghanistan, we spent some time with him at the start of January when he was settling in at a remote base in Southern Helmand Province, and most recently, we filmed with him last week at a new location in Helmand Province.  In truth, the surprise is that the agreement lasted so long. We - and the other UK broadcasters - were clear that we would not report his deployment. But nor would we deceive our audiences.  On Christmas Day, when neither Prince William nor Prince Harry attended the regular service with other members of the Royal Family at Sandringham, we agreed with the Ministry of Defence that they would say that both princes were spending Christmas with their regiments - William volunteered for Christmas duty to help out his brother! It prompted some inquiries from one US TV network who had to be briefed on the story.  More recently, on Tuesday, the German newspaper Bild ran a diary story asking ""where's Prince Harry?"" and speculating that the gossip was that ""he'd gone to war"". We agreed that while the story was speculative and confined to diary pages, that we would not break the agreement we'd reached with the MoD.  Then yesterday, the Drudge Report - the online US website famous for breaking the story of Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky - put the story on its front page. The game was up. We, and the other broadcasters, agreed with the Ministry of Defence that the story was out and it would be wrong not to tell our audiences what had been going on.  We don't do this stuff lightly - there are no other ""voluntary agreements"" in place at the moment, there's nothing else we're not telling you. Until yesterday, only a handful of people in the BBC knew about the story - trust me, keeping secrets from other journalists is hard work! Our job normally is to make these things public, not keep them from you. But this was never just about Prince Harry's safety, it was also about the security of the soldiers serving with him. No editor wants to be responsible for increasing the risk they already face from the Taleban. Nor do I think our audiences would have thanked us for doing so.  "

21,"Police have searched a Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence.  No arrests have been made and Sir Cliff, 73, who is abroad, said the allegation was ""completely false"".  Police said the allegation involved a boy under 16.  The BBC understands it relates to an alleged sexual assault at a 1985 event where US preacher Billy Graham appeared at Bramall Lane, Sheffield.  The allegation is believed to have been reported to police recently.  The search in Sunningdale was carried out by South Yorkshire Police, which told the BBC it did not force entry to the property.  The investigation is not connected to Operation Yewtree and police said officers from that operation - set up by the Metropolitan Police to investigate hundreds of allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal - had been notified.  Thames Valley Police said it had assisted the South Yorkshire force with the execution of a search warrant at the property.  Eight plain-clothed police officers in five unmarked cars arrived to conduct the search which ended at about 15:30 BST.  In his statement, Sir Cliff Richard complained that the press appeared to have been given advance notice that his home in Berkshire was to be searched - whereas he hadn't been. He was referring to the reporters and camera crew from the BBC who were outside when police arrived.  It used to be common practice for police to let reporters know they were about to raid a celebrity's house or make a high-profile arrest.  It was part of the trade of information and favours between cops and hacks that has so recently fallen into disrepute. Procedures began to change in 2008 when the High Court considered the lawfulness of a search at the home of the football manager Harry Redknapp, who was being investigated for fraud.  The court described as ""understandable"" his complaint that journalists from the Sun had been present.  Two years ago, the Leveson Inquiry concluded that police operations involving the media should be ""controlled more tightly"" to avoid the ""perception of favouritism"" and the ""risk of violating the private rights of individuals"".  Since then, tip offs have dried to a trickle despite a series of high profile arrests. The media presence at Sir Cliff Richard's home, therefore, was highly unusual - it appears to be a deliberate attempt by police to ensure maximum coverage.  That's not illegal - but there are strict guidelines - and the force may have to justify its approach in the months to come.  Sir Cliff has responded to the police search of his apartment in a statement, which said: ""For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online.  ""The allegations are completely false. Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.  ""However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.  ""I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will cooperate fully should the police wish to speak to me. Beyond stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has concluded.""  Sir Cliff's spokesman said the singer would not be conducting interviews at this time.  According to the BBC's Tom Burridge in the Algarve, Portugal, the singer left his home there on Thursday morning and has travelled with his sister to another part of Portugal for a few days.  The singer, born Harry Webb, is one of the most successful British musicians of all time.  He has sold 21.5 million singles - more than any other male British artist - and is the only performer to have had at least one UK top five album in each of the last seven decades.  He has represented the UK in the Eurovision song contest twice and in 2013 released the 100th album of his career.

23,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
24,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

Before the Earl of Scarborough turned them into The Pleasure Gardens they were a coal yard, and before that the area was used for storage by the Tyneside Cargo boats after the landed on Skegness sands.  During the Victorian years when a visit to a seaside resort was becoming fashionable it was essential for the visitor to enjoy a stroll around the gardens and listen to the band.  It’s not just the gardens that were designed by him but he also employed an architect to help plan around the existing Skegness. As well as the gardens and the pier the Earl of Scarborough envisioned promenades with tree lined streets. In essence, he wanted to create the perfect coastal holiday destination on the East coast.  These days the sort of entertainment you might see in the park is not only brass bands but many other musicians performing different styles. There’s also storytelling, treasure hunts, gala days, art exhibitions and craft weekends.  Continue through the park and leave by another gate at the opposite to which you entered.

28,"BBC Sport is profiling 20 of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time. The BBC F1 team were asked to provide their own personal top 20s, which were combined to produce a BBC list.  Chief F1 writer Andrew Benson profiles number 16, Nelson Piquet - while Murray Walker gives his own recollections in the video above.  Few drivers have had perceptions of them shift as dramatically throughout their careers as Nelson Piquet.  For a while in the mid-1980s, Piquet was regarded as the best driver in the world but, as his career went on, his stock fell and at the end he slipped out of F1 almost unnoticed - and largely unlamented.  How did this happen to a man who is one of only eight drivers to win three or more world titles?  The son of a prominent Brazilian politician, Piquet made a low-key entry into F1 with a backmarker team midway through 1978 but, by the end of that season, he joined Brabham where he was to stay until 1985.  As team-mate to Niki Lauda, Piquet was increasingly impressive through 1979, rapidly becoming their lead driver as the great Austrian's motivation flagged - Lauda finally called it a day part-way through the Canadian Grand Prix weekend towards the end of the season, declaring he was bored of ""driving around in circles"".  Piquet's elevation to team leader could not have come at a better time. There followed two years where he not only had one of history's great cars but also had uncompetitive pay-driver team-mates, so faced no competition from within the team.  He lost an increasingly bitter world title battle with Williams driver Alan Jones in 1980.  But the following year he won three races and somewhat fortuitously took the title after the favourite, Carlos Reutemann of Williams, inexplicably faded from pole position to finish seventh at the final race of the year.  Unfit and almost comatose in the desert heat of Las Vegas, Piquet had to be revived and lifted out of his car at the end of the race, but still managed to finish fifth, passing the Argentine on the way.  The year of his first title defence was lost in a haze of blue smoke and fire as BMW perfected its new turbo engine, following in the footsteps of Renault and Ferrari.  But the hard work paid off in 1983, when Piquet and Brabham-BMW became the first people to win the F1 title with a turbo engine.  Reliability took a hit in 1984, but if anything Piquet's reputation soared as he took nine poles and two wins amid more engine failures.  But the relationship between team and driver, once so strong, was beginning to sour. Brabham boss Bernie Ecclestone's decision to use uncompetitive Pirelli tyres in 1985 did not help, but the real issue was money.  Piquet, a notorious womaniser, lived a simple life, avoiding PR work and preferring to spend his time away from races on his boat. But he knew his worth, and Ecclestone was not paying him it.  So when Frank Williams offered him £3m - a record at the time - to join his team for 1986, Piquet agonised over it but eventually accepted.  He was teamed with Nigel Mansell, and most expected the double champion to comfortably have the edge on a man who had only just broken a five-year win duck.  Mansell, though, quickly established himself as the faster driver, and the two fought a tense duel for the title in both 1986 and 1987 as Piquet put guile to work against Mansell's brute force.  In the first year, Mansell won five races and Piquet four, but both ended up losing out on the title - deservedly, many felt, to Alain Prost, who drove exquisitely in the less-competitive McLaren, and who by now had replaced Piquet in most eyes as the best driver in the world.  In 1987, Piquet's form suffered after a monumental crash at Imola early in the season - at the same corner where Ayrton Senna was later killed - but he used his cunning to win the title, despite winning only three races to Mansell's seven.  At the end of the year, Piquet left Williams, taking the standard-setting Honda engines with him to Lotus.  But the Lotus was not a good car, and Piquet was nowhere near as far ahead of team-mate Satoru Nakajima as Senna had been the year before.  As Piquet slid out of the limelight, so the mischievous - some would say unpleasant - side to his character came to the fore.  He notoriously called Mansell ""an uneducated blockhead with a stupid and ugly wife"" and referred to Senna disparagingly as ""the Sao Paulo taxi driver"", as well as making derogatory comments about his private life.  The remarks served no purpose other than to diminish further Piquet's reputation. It escaped no-one that he was making these remarks about men who had by then established themselves as better drivers than him.  Nevertheless, he did have a last hurrah. Piquet joined Benetton for 1990, and the season ended with two unexpected wins, albeit in races in which major contenders Senna and Prost did not finish.  There was a final win in Canada in 1991, after Mansell famously stalled when he let his engine revs drop too low while prematurely celebrating on his final lap, and Piquet could not hide his delight at his rival's misfortune.  The final death knell for Piquet's career came in the shape of Michael Schumacher, whom Benetton poached from under Jordan's nose for the final five races of the season.  The young prodigy's pace was too much for Piquet and the German out-qualified his veteran team-mate in the first four of their races together.  Heading into what he by then knew would be his last grand prix in Adelaide, Piquet was determined not to let it happen again.  In practice, he completely forgot about the race performance of his car and set it up solely to be as fast as it could be over one lap, just so he could line up ahead of Schumacher on the grid.  The ploy worked, with Piquet snatching fourth, one place and 0.217secs ahead of Schumacher - only for chief race engineer Pat Symonds to burst Piquet's bubble and tell him Schumacher had missed a gear on his fastest lap. But for that, the German prodigy would have been faster again.  It was the last action of a great - but flawed - champion.  In the final analysis, Piquet might not ultimately have been quite as good as he at one stage seemed to be. But in more than 60 years of Formula 1, there have not been that many who were better."

31,"Antarctic fur seals have been filmed catching and eating king penguins in the open ocean, behaviour not seen before.  Male Antarctic fur seals are known to occasionally take king penguins on land.  But this is the first time seals have been observed chasing, killing and eating king penguins at sea.  The preference for king-sized fast food has evolved among fur seals living at Possession Island in the Indian Ocean.  Details of the behaviour are published in the journal Polar Biology.  Catching a king penguin at sea is not easy.  They can weigh up to 13kg at certain times of the year and are very fast moving in the water.  ""Both species are very fast swimming and agile animals,"" says Dr Karine Delord of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, who observed the behaviour.  Usually, the penguins are predated upon by much larger leopard seals and orcas.  Fur seals are also known to prey on king penguins on the shore, a behaviour filmed by the BBC Planet Earth Series.  ""But our observations add strength to the unique similar predation in the water,"" says Dr Delord.  She and her colleagues Dr Yohan Charbonnier and Dr Jean-Baptiste Thiebot were studying the conservation of penguins, sooty albatrosses and giant petrels around Possession Island, one of five small islands that make up the Crozet archipelago in the southern Indian Ocean.  While located high up on top of a nearby cliff, they witnessed fur seals predating on king penguins below them in the sea on 17 occasions during five days.  The longest chase took five hours, when one male fur seal successively attacked at least ten king penguins.  Though all were injured, each made it to the shore.  Later the researchers witnessed a fur seal killing and eating a king penguin at sea.  ""We found that predation on king penguins by Antarctic fur seals is more common and widespread than previously reported,"" says Dr Delord.  ""It is too early to assess the impact of such behaviour because our observations need to be quantified on a longer period of time and other colonies of king penguins.""  However, as seal numbers increase in the area, they could start to have a greater impact on small populations of king penguins.  ""Furthermore, the impact on injured adults is probably more difficult to evaluate because some of them survive the attacks, at least a few days,"" she adds.  ""But it is necessary to estimate the impact on their breeding and survival at a longer time.""  Currently, 30,000 pairs of king penguins reside at the largest colony on Possession Island, while less than 500 seals live in the same area.  The fur seals are still recovering, after both species were nearly driven extinct by human hunters at Crozet during the 19th century.  So far, the researchers have not documented female Antarctic fur seals attacking king penguins at sea, though it is unclear why the females do not also hunt penguins.  At nearby Marion Island, where most documented attacks by Antarctic fur seals on shore-bound penguins occur, males, and particularly sub-adults males, are responsible."

The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
34,"Giving up some rights means you still have protection under the law Advocates of open source software have hailed a court ruling protecting its use even though it is given away free. The US federal appeals court move overturned a lower court decision involving free software used in model trains that a hobbyist put online. The court has now said conditions of an agreement called the Artistic Licence were enforceable under copyright law. ""For non-lawgeeks, this won't seem important but this is huge,"" said Stanford Law Professor Larry Lessig. ""In non-technical terms, the Court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work. When you violate the condition, the licence disappears, meaning you're simply a copyright infringer. ""This is a very important victory."" According to details outlined in the ruling, Robert Jacobsen had written and then released code under an Artistic Licence. This meant anyone using that free code had to attribute the author, highlight the original source of the files and explain how the code had been modified. Mr Jacobsen, who manages open source software group Java Model Railroad Interface, accused commercial software developer Matthew Katzer and his company of ignoring the terms of the Artistic Licence when they took his code and used it to develop commercial software products for trains. Individual credit for contributions not cash drives the community An earlier court ruling did not agree with Mr Jacobsen's stance that Mr Katzer and his company had infringed his copyright and said the licence Mr Jacobsen used was ""intentionally broad."" Instead the court ruled he might be able to claim breach of contract. Legal experts have said the distinction is important since under federal copyright law a plaintiff can seek statutory damages and can be more easily granted an injunction than under contract law. But now the US appeals court ""determined that the terms of the Artistic License are enforceable copyright conditions"". ""Copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials,"" Judge Jeffrey White wrote in his 15-page decision. ""Open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago,"" Judge White said. Mark Radcliffe of the Open Source Initiative said: ""Although the reasoning is limited to the Artistic Licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions, this decision is a welcome change."" The ruling has implications for the Creative Commons licence which offers ways for work to go into the public domain and still be protected. These licenses are widely used by academic organisations like MIT for distributing coursework, scientific groups, artists, movie makers and Wikipedia among others. Creative Commons releases copyright licences under its name Creative Commons filed an amicus or friends brief on behalf of Mr Jacobsen. Its general counsel Diane Peters told BBC News ""The federal court recognised that even though licensors give up some rights it doesn't mean they have any less rights to access the remedies our law provides. ""This opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principle of the internet; that even though money doesn't change hands, attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy."" If the case had gone the other way it would have been a real blow to the open source movement, according to Jeff Neuberger a partner at Proskauer Rose LLP. He told the Wall Street Journal: ""Lots of companies rely on open source, and if they had lost their ability to enforce their rights they would have shied away from the software."""
35,"Bangladesh are on the worst losing run in the history of one-day cricket, hardly the perfect preparation for the World Cup.  It is almost four years since their last win - the shock victory over Pakistan at the 1999 World Cup.  They have suffered 25 defeats over four years, a world record that surpasses the one they established in losing their first 22 matches between 1986 and 1998.  In that period they have lost to each of the nine other sides that compete in Test cricket.  It is a sorry state of affairs and Bangladesh's place as the 10th Test-playing nation at cricket's top table has been seriously questioned.  For as well as their woeful one-day record, Bangladesh have yet to win a Test match in 17 outings.  Their present run of eight successive losses is also a record for the longer version of the game.  ""We still have a long way to go and need to work hard and concentrate harder to reach that kind of level.  ""But otherwise the morale in the side is fine and the discipline is excellent, which is very important.""  He is the third coach to occupy the post since Gordon Greenidge was sacked on the morning of that famous victory over Pakistan.  The West Indian was replaced by South African Eddie Barlow, a man held in high esteem in his adopted country before he left the post after suffering a brain haemorrhage.  Australian Trevor Chappell subsequently oversaw a relative downturn in the team's fortunes before he was, in turn, replaced by Kamal.  Never once in the run of defeats he has watched over has Kamal's team looked like winning.  A highest score of 226 was easily surpassed by Sri Lanka and would not have been enough in any of the 13 matches they have played over the last year.  And Bangladesh's bowlers are seemingly incapable of exerting any kind of authority over opponents.  However, a new losing streak is sure to start in the very next match and it remains to be seen how long it will last."

37,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means.

39,"Newport West MP Paul Flynn has tabled a Commons motion accusing Foreign Office minister Kim Howells of ""schoolboy"" comments about ""life and death"" issues.  Dr Howells mocked anyone who thought by eating muesli, reading The Independent and attending Pinter plays, ""the drug barons of Afghanistan will go away"".  But the Pontypridd MP said he took the issue ""extraordinarily seriously"".  In the motion, Mr Flynn said sending troops to Afghanistan was ""potentially catastrophic"", with five British soldiers having been killed in the country during the troubles.  It arose from an exchange in the Commons earlier in the week, when Mr Flynn had told the minister that sending more British troops to the country would lead to increased violence which could turn many Afghans to supporting the Taliban, the regime deposed in 2001.  On heroin production in Afghanistan, Mr Flynn said: ""A 20% decrease in the area cultivated but only a 2% decrease in the amount of heroin produced: are we not on mission impossible, sending troops into the Helmand province?  ""Will that not result, perversely, in an increase of violence that drives local farmers into the hands of the Taliban?  ""Are not our present policies leading to the Colombianisation of large parts of central Asia?""  In his reply, Dr Howells said Mr Flynn's policies would lead that way, adding: ""It is not enough to assume that if people eat the right kind of muesli, go to first nights of Harold Pinter revivals and read The Independent occasionally, the drug barons of Afghanistan will go away.  ""They will not.  ""The poison that is being pumped into the veins of children in the UK is coming from Afghanistan and we must play our part to stop that happening.""  Mr Howells told the BBC Wales news website: ""I answered [the question] in my own way and if he doesn't like it, he can do what he likes about it.  """"I take extraordinarily seriously the issue of Afghanistan and have been working very closely with my colleagues in DFID (Department for International Development) and the MoD (Ministry of Defence) to ensure that our troops have the maximum protection in Afghanistan.""  Dr Howells has provoked strong reactions in the past with his outspoken comments.  While arts minister, he wrote on a comment slip that items shortlisted for the Turner Prize were ""conceptual bullshit"".  He also remarked during a Commons debate on licensing laws the idea of ""listening to three Somerset folk singers sounds like hell"".  He once described the royal family as ""a bit bonkers""."

The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.

48,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

53,"The Spanish region of Catalonia has held an unofficial referendum on independence as part of a campaign to move the issue up the political agenda. Some 94% of those who voted backed independence. ""The people of Catalonia have chosen to form an independent state,"" said Carlos Mora, mayor of a small town. But the vote was condemned by critics. Only one in 10 of Catalonia's residents were invited to vote, and they were in known pro-independence regions. The residents were asked if Catalonia should ""become a social, democratic and independent state"". The outcome has no legal force, as any referendum in Spain must be mandated by the national government. Catalonia, which includes the city of Barcelona, is Spain's richest region. Accounting for 25% of the country's GDP, it has its own language, Catalan, and already enjoys autonomous status. Supporters hope that Sunday's poll will be the first step towards a formal ballot for a separate state, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports. Almost 170 Catalan towns and villages held ballots, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Further referendums are being planned in other parts of the region, including Barcelona, Girona and Lleida, early next year. Representatives from Italy's South Tyrol region, the French island of Corsica, Belgium's Flemish region and the Canadian province of Quebec A statute on relations with the Spanish state which was approved by Catalans three years ago gave the region more local jurisdiction and what many believe is a fairer share of the revenue collected. But Spain's main opposition party is contesting the statute in the Constitutional Court and many Catalans fear key provisions of the law will soon be overturned, our correspondent says. Joan Laporta, chairman of the Barcelona football club, told the Spanish newspaper El Pais that the vote was a reaction to central government pressure on the region. ""Catalonia is dying, they are killing it and we must react,"" he said. ""No Catalan can accept the fiscal pillaging that we are suffering nor the attacks on the rights and freedoms of Catalonia."" Teams of international observers from regions of the world with independence or secessionist movements are attending Sunday's vote, AFP news agency notes. They include representatives of the Scottish National Party and the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, as well as others from Italy's South Tyrol region, the French island of Corsica, Belgium's Flemish region and the Canadian province of Quebec. Political representatives of Spain's Galicia and Basque regions, which both have independence movements, are also observing the vote.     "

59,"Singer Sir Cliff Richard is suing the BBC and South Yorkshire Police after being investigated over allegations of historical sexual assault.  Legal papers were filed at the High Court in London on Thursday.  They list Sir Cliff as a claimant, and the BBC and chief constable of South Yorkshire Police as defendants.  The star, 75, has always denied the allegations, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in June it was taking no further action against him.  The decision to sue the BBC and South Yorkshire Police comes after Sir Cliff was the subject of a long-running police investigation based on allegations dating between 1958 and 1983 made by four men.  Sir Cliff was named as the subject of the investigation after police officers searching his apartment in 2014 were filmed by the BBC.  The CPS announced it was taking no further action against Sir Cliff on 16 June on the grounds of insufficient evidence.  That decision was reviewed last month following an application by one of his alleged accusers, but concluded the original decision not to proceed was correct.  After that announcement, Sir Cliff told BBC Radio 2 that ""a cloud lifted"" when he was informed of the news he would not be prosecuted.  The singer has previously spoken publicly about the investigation and the publicity surrounding it.  In a statement released in June he criticised what he called ""vile accusations"", adding he was ""named before I was even interviewed, and for me that was like being hung out like 'live bait'"".  A spokesman for the singer said: ""We can confirm that Sir Cliff today issued legal proceedings at the High Court against both South Yorkshire Police and the BBC. It would not be appropriate to comment further.""  A BBC spokesman said: ""While we haven't received any notification of action, we've said previously we are very sorry that Sir Cliff has suffered distress but we have a duty to report on matters of public interest and we stand by our journalism."""
60,"A 113-million-year-old fossil from Brazil is the first four-legged snake that scientists have ever seen.  Several other fossil snakes have been found with hind limbs, but the new find is estimated to be a direct ancestor of modern snakes.  Its delicate arms and legs were not used for walking, but probably helped the creature to grab its prey.  The fossil shows adaptations for burrowing, not swimming, strengthening the idea that snakes evolved on land.  That debate is a long-running one among palaeontologists, and researchers say wiggle room is running out for the idea that snakes developed from marine reptiles.  ""This is the most primitive fossil snake known, and it's pretty clearly not aquatic,"" said Dr Nick Longrich from the University of Bath, one of the authors of the new study published in Science magazine.  Speaking to Science in Action on the BBC World Service, Dr Longrich explained that the creature's tail wasn't paddle-shaped for swimming and it had no sign of fins; meanwhile its long trunk and short snout were typical of a burrower.  ""It's pretty straight-up adapted for burrowing,"" he said.  When Dr Longrich first saw photos of the 19.5cm fossil, now christened Tetrapodophis amplectus, he was ""really blown away"" because he was expecting an ambiguous, in-between species.  Instead, he saw ""a lot of very advanced snake features"" including its hooked teeth, flexible jaw and spine - and even snake-like scales.  ""And there's the gut contents - it's swallowed another vertebrate. It was preying on other animals, which is a snake feature.  ""It was pretty unambiguously a snake. It's just got little arms and little legs.""  At 4mm and 7mm long respectively, those arms and legs are little indeed. But Dr Longrich was surprised to discover that they were far from being ""vestigial"" evolutionary leftovers, dangling uselessly.  ""They're actually very highly specialised - they have very long, skinny fingers and toes, with little claws on the end. What we think [these animals] are doing is they've stopped using them for walking and they're using them for grasping their prey.""  That comparatively feeble grasp, which may have also been applied during mating, is where the species gets its name. Tetrapodophis, the fossil's new genus, means four-footed snake, but amplectus is Latin for ""embrace"".  ""It would sort of embrace or hug its prey with its forelimbs and hindlimbs. So it's the huggy snake,"" Dr Longrich said.  In order to try to pinpoint the huggy snake's place in history, the team constructed a family tree using known information about the physical and genetic make-up of living and ancient snakes, plus some related reptiles.  That analysis positioned T. amplectus as a branch - the earliest branch - on the the very same tree that gave rise to modern snakes.  Remarkably, this significant specimen languished in a private collection for decades, before a museum in Solnhofen, Germany, acquired and exhibited it under the label ""unknown fossil"".  It was there that Dr Dave Martill, another of the paper's authors, stumbled upon it while leading a student field trip. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 they were principally visiting to see the museum's famous Archaeopteryx fossil.  ""All of a sudden my jaw absolutely dropped, when I saw this little fossil like a piece of string,"" said Dr Martill, from the University of Portsmouth.  As he peered closer, he managed to spot the four tiny legs - and immediately asked the museum for permission to study the creature.  Dr Bruno Simoes, who studies the evolution of snake vision at the Natural History Museum in London, told the BBC he was impressed by the new find because the snake's limbs are so well preserved, and appear so well developed.  ""It's quite a surprise, especially because it's so close to the crown group - basically, the current snakes,"" he said.  ""It gives us a good idea of what the ancestral snake was like.""  Dr Simoes suggested that alongside several other recent findings, this new fossil evidence had clinched the argument for snakes evolving on land.  ""All [the latest findings] suggest that the ancestor of all snakes was a terrestrial animal... which lived partially underground."""
61,"While Spain's leading newspapers are at one in calling the sinking of the Prestige a catastrophe which never should have happened, a leading daily in Portugal calls Madrid to account over the disaster.  A commentary in Lisbon's Diario de Noticias expresses fears that the Portuguese coast could be at risk because of the way the Spanish authorities have handled the crisis.  The daily says the ""black tide"" could pose a serious threat to the Portuguese coastline and suggests Spain could have taken alternative measures to ensure it did not drift south.  ""The environmental catastrophe which is afflicting Galicia raises serious doubts about the actions of the Spanish authorities.""  Madrid's goodwill towards Portugal, says Diario, ""is not enough to outweigh its own interests"", and Spain should be called to account.  Another leading Portuguese daily, Publico speaks of an ""ecological disaster"".  In Spain itself, an editorial in El Pais argues that ""disasters like the Prestige... reveal the powerlessness of the European authorities to stop the strategies used by the oil companies and ship owners to get round the rules on safety"".  An opinion poll in El Pais has more than 90% of respondents calling for the rules governing maritime transport to be made as strict as those applicable to airlines.  Dramatic pictures of the Prestige fill the front pages of all the Madrid dailies.  ""Time bomb under the sea"" is the headline in ABC, while La Razon talks of ""Ecological alarm as the Prestige sinks"".  In Barcelona, La Vanguardia says that the sinking of the Prestige ""mainly affects Galicia, but the whole of the European Union should also feel involved"".  ""The EU directives on maritime transport must be quickly introduced into domestic legal systems so ships like the Prestige are subjected to the strictest possible preventative controls,"" it urges.  ""This is not a question of the loss of a few tonnes of barnacles, but of the collective security of the seas; and today security is an unshakable priority.""  El Periodico De Catalunya, another Barcelona daily, notes that faced with the leakage of fuel, ""the decision was taken to tow the boat out to the deep blue yonder, following the well-known practice of cleaners who use their brooms to brush dust under the carpet"".  ""The Prestige was evil, and evil must be moved as far away as possible. Out of sight, out of mind... Was the aim to share the risk with Portugal, as if the environment were a national and not a planetary asset?""  El Periodico accuses the authorities of making the captain a scapegoat. ""We saw the captain of the Prestige between civil guardsmen, under arrest after fighting the sea for hours and hours amid the distress of his broken boat.  ""But the unfair picture of the Civil Guard and the captain reassured us all. The evil had a face and was under arrest. And on top of that, they were going to Gibraltar. Bingo.""  Several dailies report the government in Madrid was planning to use F-18 military planes to bomb the stricken tanker in the hope of both setting ablaze the oil and sending the ship to the bottom.  El Mundo quotes a top official of the Norwegian state oil company Statoil as saying it registered the Prestige as ""unsuitable"" because of its age and because it lacked a double hull.  BBC Monitoring, based in Caversham in southern England, selects and translates information from radio, television, press, news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages."
62,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
63,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

The Ospreys star beat Scotland skipper Mike Blair, Wales captain Ryan Jones, All Black fly-half Dan Carter and Italy captain Sergio Parisse to the award. The wing became the first Welshman to win the individual award. ""It's been a hell of a year and this has just capped it off really,"" said Wales' record try-scorer. During 2008 the 31-year-old Williams broke the Welsh try-scoring record and inspired Wales to the 2008 Grand Slam. Williams already won the RBS Six Nations Player of the Year gong as his six tries equalling Will Greenwood's Six Nations try-scoring record. ""It's quite mad to be honest,"" said Williams. ""It's the biggest honour you can get as an individual in rugby and it's totally overwhelming. ""Just being nominated was humbling. And to receive the award from Bryan Habana, who is one of the best - if not the best - wing in the world means so much to me."" ""I was more nervous up there on stage than I was facing the haka against the All Blacks on Saturday!"" Did you know?: Williams preferred football as a child and supports Blackburn Rovers Williams scored decisive tries in four of Wales' five Six Nations wins and his score in the Grand Slam decider against France was the 41st try of his international career, breaking Gareth Thomas's all-time Welsh try record. Williams, who boasts a prolific international strike-rate of 43 tries in 62 Tests, was also a key member of the Ospreys side that won the EDF Energy Cup last season. But his sensational displays and lethal finishing helped secure his, and Wales', second Six Nations clean sweep in four years and captured the imagination of the rugby world. Williams' award is remarkable given he once considered quitting rugby after admitting he had ""had a gutsful"" of the game. In 2002 he suffered a series of hamstring injuries and was not in former Wales coach Steve Hansen's plans. ""I was fed up and felt like quitting,"" recalled Williams. ""There were times when I thought it wasn't worth it and I was convinced I wouldn't play for Wales again."" Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Williams' determination drove him back to the big stage and he starred for Wales at the 2003 World Cup before playing for the British and Irish Lions in 2005. ""You have to be stubborn and bloody-minded,"" said the 5ft 6in wing, who has often been accused of being too small to be a world-class international player. Plucked from obscurity in his early 20s from amateur side Amman United where he was playing as a scrum-half, Williams was a late-comer to professional rugby. The then-Neath coach Lyn Jones spotted his potential and signed him for the Welsh All Blacks but when Welsh rugby went regional, Williams followed Jones to the Ospreys Williams joins an elite list of top rugby players to have won the IRB award with previous winners including Ireland's Keith Wood, Fabien Galthie of France, England's Jonny Wilkinson, Schalk Burger of South Africa, New Zealand pair Carter and Richie McCaw, and Springbok Bryan Habana. The winner was selected by the award's independent panel of judges - headed by legendary Australian captain John Eales - comprising more than 500 Test caps between then. Tri-Nations champions New Zealand were named team of the year, with their coach Graham Henry coach of the year. Henry said: ""There have been 15 or so players who left us after the World Cup to play in this part of the world so it's great to have a team that's relatively young and inexperienced come through and do the business."" The International Rugby Players' Association special merit award went to former Argentina captain Agustin Pichot in recognition of his ""tremendous service to the game on and off the field.""     "
65,"An ancient city in what is now Peru was built at the same time as the great pyramids of Egypt, archaeologists have revealed. New evidence indicates the desert site at Caral, on the slopes of the Andes, was built between 2,600 BC and 2,000 BC.    What we're learning from Caral is going to rewrite the way we think about the development of early Andean civilisation    This date pushes back the emergence of the first complex society in the New World by nearly 800 years. And it suggests that the people behind the project were advanced enough to organise the labour needed to create the architectural wonder of the day. Caral is one of 18 sites in central Peru's Supe Valley, which stretches eastward from the Pacific coastline, up the slopes of the Andes. All the inland settlements once had architecture on a grand scale, including the six huge platform mounds seen at Caral. Because of its size and complexity, archaeologists had thought Caral was built about 1,500 BC. But carbon dating of plant samples found at the site add another 1,000 years or so to this figure. That puts Caral in the same period as the great pyramids of Egypt, and long before the huge stone structures of Mexico. ""What we're learning from Caral is going to rewrite the way we think about the development of early Andean civilisation,"" said study leader Jonathan Haas of the Field Museum in Chicago, US. The Peruvian-American archaeological team says the pyramids and irrigation system show an organised society in which masses of people were paid, or compelled, to work on centralised projects. This suggests that power and wealth were held by an elite group at a time when, in most of the Americas, people were still hunting and gathering in much smaller communities. ""The size of a structure is really an indication of power,"" said Haas. ""It means that leaders of the society were able to get their followers to do lots of work."" What is surprising to archaeologists is that the city was created by a society that had yet to invent pottery or cultivate grain. Its people grew peppers, beans, avocadoes and potatoes - all of which they roasted, having no pots to boil them in. They also ate lots of anchovies, which may have been used in dried form as a kind of currency, as grain was later. The research is published in the journal Science."
66,"Jacob Zuma's advisers say he has nothing to hide South Africa's opposition leader has called for an investigation into whether President Jacob Zuma has broken the government's strict ethics code. This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "

68,"Nothe Fort in Weymouth is a monument to a time when military sea defence was an important part of life not only for Weymouth and Portland, but was considered a priority for the whole country.  Fearing an attack from the French, Prime Minister Palmerston endorsed an 1860 report that recommended building a series of sea defences in strategic positions around the UK coast.  But by the time Nothe Fort was completed in 1872, the threat from the French had long passed and the fort's firepower had been superceded – resulting in Nothe Fort, and the other forts that had been built as part of the plans, becoming known as Palmerston's Follies – said to be the most expensive programme of fixed defence ever built in peacetime.  During World War II, the fort had an anti-aircraft gun stationed inside it, but its main role was storing anti-aircraft ammunition for the south west.  The fort remained in service until 1956, and Weymouth and Portland Borough Council took over responsibility in 1961.  Abandoned, the building fell into disrepair at the hands of trespassers and squatters, but its prime location and spectacular views of Weymouth seafront and Portland ensured it was never totally forgotten.  But since the building's takeover by the Weymouth Civic Society, the fort, since 1980, has slowly been restored to its former glory, plus a military museum, and is one of Weymouth's most popular tourist attractions with up to 45,000 visitors a year.  David Joy, Director of Nothe Fort, says: ""It's a very important building and it's a part of our heritage. It was built to defend this part of the coast and it's a monument to the endeavours of the Victorian engineers.  ""It shows their brilliance in construction - thousands of tonnes of rock were brought in and a lot of it was put in place by hand - it's a testament to their ingenuity.""  And as well as a reminder of Dorset's contribution to military history, the fort is also developing a new community-based role, staging plays by local theatre groups in the central courtyard.  The fort is run by a team of five paid staff members and a dedicated team of 70 volunteers.  Says Brian: ""Lots of work has been done on the fort and there's great comradeship between all of the volunteers.""  Anyone interested in volunteering at the fort can contact Director David Joy.  David says: ""We're always on the look out for volunteers. We couldn't run the fort without them. There's always a role for someone to play here, whatever your skills may be."""

Legal papers were filed at the High Court in London on Thursday.  They list Sir Cliff as a claimant, and the BBC and chief constable of South Yorkshire Police as defendants.  The star, 75, has always denied the allegations, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in June it was taking no further action against him.  The decision to sue the BBC and South Yorkshire Police comes after Sir Cliff was the subject of a long-running police investigation based on allegations dating between 1958 and 1983 made by four men.  Sir Cliff was named as the subject of the investigation after police officers searching his apartment in 2014 were filmed by the BBC.  The CPS announced it was taking no further action against Sir Cliff on 16 June on the grounds of insufficient evidence.  That decision was reviewed last month following an application by one of his alleged accusers, but concluded the original decision not to proceed was correct.

71,"Agatha Christie is the best-selling fiction author of all time A collection of previously unheard recordings of crime writer Agatha Christie talking about her life and work has surfaced in Devon after lying undiscovered for 40 years. The reels of tape, over 13 hours long, were discovered by the author's grandson in a cardboard box during a spring clean-out at Christie's former home in Torquay. They date back to the 1960s and are working notes for her autobiography which was published posthumously in 1977. But the recordings go into far greater detail about some aspects of Christie's life than the finished book, with descriptions of what life was like in wartime Britain, her honeymoon with her second husband and the reason why she would never let her legendary sleuths Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple meet. Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady    Christie also provides some insight about how she came to create Miss Marple, the elderly spinster who acts as an amateur detective and appears in 12 of her novels. ""Miss Marple insinuated herself so quietly into my life, that I think I hardly noticed her arrival. I just had the idea, possibly for a series of six short stories for one special magazine, and I chose the people who I thought would be suitable. ""An old spinster lady living in a village, the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my grandmother's cronies... old ladies like I had seen in the private hotel in South Kensington... and old ladies like I had met in so many villages where I had gone to stay as a girl."" When it comes to solving mysteries Miss Marple is shrewdly intelligent She is adamant that Miss Marple is not based on her grandmother but admits there are similarities. ""She had this in common with my grandmother, that although a completely cheerful person she always expected the worst of anyone and everything - and with almost frightening accuracy usually proved right."" The tapes, recorded on a Grundig Memorette reel-to-reel tape recorder, are believed to have been made at Christie's home, and in some sections her dogs can be heard barking in the background. Again and again, she hits the pause button as she takes a moment to think. Her relaxed, informal tone is charming to listen to and a rarity, as she disliked being interviewed, was shy and wary of media attention. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Only a handful of recordings of her voice are known to exist - including a 1955 interview for the BBC and a 1974 recording for the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive in which she recounts her experiences in a World War I dispensary which gave her a working knowledge of poisons - something which would feed into her murder mysteries. Unfortunately, the tapes give no insight into one of the most intriguing parts of her life - the mysterious episode in 1926 when, having been told by her first husband Archie that he wanted a divorce, Christie drove off alone from their Sunningdale home, abandoned her car, then took a train to Harrogate in Yorkshire where she registered herself at the Hydro Hotel as Mrs Neele (the name of her husband's mistress). She spent 12 days in Harrogate, shopping, lunching in tea rooms, having beauty treatments and even singing with the hotel's dance band, whilst becoming the subject of a nationwide search by the tabloid media. It's also wonderful to hear that latent humour and the assurance in her voice, as she talks about these ridiculously familiar characters    Her family now assume that she had a nervous breakdown, and after she was found she was diagnosed by doctors as suffering from amnesia. The media frenzy over her disappearance is thought to be one of the reasons why she tended to avoid interviews and became increasingly reclusive. Matthew Prichard, Agatha Christie's grandson, says the tapes bring an overwhelming sense of of his grandmother. ""She has little mannerisms, like the minor cough in the middle of sentences, which I had forgotten about - and all this comes back to you,"" he says. He points out that his grandmother was shy - and would never have recorded her thoughts if there had been anyone else present. She describes it as a jolt, hearing Christie's voice 32 years after her death. ""It was so nice to hear again, the essence of Agatha. She really belongs to an England that no longer exists - and you can hear that in the tapes. It's also wonderful to hear that latent humour and the assurance in her voice, as she talks about these ridiculously familiar characters."" Overwhelmingly, there is a sense from the recordings of a feisty and determined personality. ""People never stop writing to me nowadays to suggest that Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot should meet. But why should they meet? I'm sure they would not like meeting at all,"" she says. ""Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot - a professional sleuth - would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world."" Crime writer Agatha Christie at an unknown event in July 1967 ""They are both stars and stars in their own right. I shall not let them meet, unless I feel a very sudden and unexpected urge to do so."" And speaking about The Mousetrap - famed as the longest running play in London's West End since its first performance in 1952 - she said she thought its success was ""90% luck"" and that ""there was a bit of something in it for almost everybody"". She recollects that she predicted it would not run for more than eight months. And she admits she initially had some doubts about it. ""I must say that I had no feeling whatsoever that I had a great success on my hands... I went with some friends and I thought, 'I've let it have too many humorous situations, there's been too much laughter, it's taken away from the thrill'. ""I was a little depressed about it, I remember.""     "
72,"About 100,000 tonnes of sand has been earmarked to be taken from Montrose to shore up the Aberdeen beachfront.  However golfers in the Angus town say the proposal means that their erosion threatened course could be sacrificed.  The plan to take sand dredged from Montrose harbour in Angus up to Aberdeen was recently unveiled by the Scottish Executive.  Members at Montrose Golf Links argue one of the oldest courses in the world should be preserved.  One member, Montrose Central councillor Terry Wood, told BBC Scotland: ""The golf links is a great asset to Montrose.  ""The golfers believe the sand should be used to protect the golf course dunes.  ""They cannot understand why it is going to Aberdeen when it is needed to protect our own beach from erosion.  ""The Golf Links Trust would have to realign the course.""  The executive announced the funding package to bring in more sand after Aberdeen City Council officials warned that the city's sands could be lost in about 100 years, with homes and businesses destroyed by flooding.  The scheme would replenish Aberdeen with thousands of tonnes of sand from Montrose harbour.  The project was born after a previous funding scheme for the beach was turned down by the executive."
73,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

76,"More than 800,000 children die each year from burns, car crashes, falls, drowning, poisoning and other accidents, according to a UN report.  Millions more suffer injuries that leave them disabled for life, said the joint report by two UN agencies, Unicef and the World Health Organization.  Most accidents happen in developing countries, with the problem most severe in Africa and South-East Asia.  Simple prevention measures could halve the number of deaths, the report said.  The top five causes of injury and death are road crashes, drowning, burns, falls and poisoning, according to the World Report on Child Injury Prevention 2008.  Road crashes kill 260,000 children a year, injure about 10 million and are the leading cause of death among 10-19 year olds.  About 175,000 children die through drowning every year.  Fire-related burns kill nearly 96,000 children a year, while nearly 47,000 children fall to their deaths every year and more than 45,000 die from unintended poisoning.  ""Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of childhood death after the age of nine years and 95% of these child injuries occur in developing countries,"" said Ann Veneman, Unicef executive director.  ""More must be done to prevent such harm to children.""  Urgent action is needed, the organisations said.  ""The price of failure is high,"" Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, added.  ""On current estimates, unintentional injuries claim the lives of around 830,000 children worldwide every year.""  Africa has the highest rate for unintentional injury deaths.  Its rate is 10 times higher than that in higher-income countries in Europe, which have the lowest rates of child injury.  But accident-related deaths still account for 40% of all child deaths in developed countries.  Better emergency medical care and rehabilitation services would help, the report said, as would the redesign of toys and playground equipment.  Using seatbelts and helmets, fencing in pools and water, and using child-safe medicine bottles could reduce the rate of accidents, it added."

The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.

But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports.

86,"Bangladesh are on the worst losing run in the history of one-day cricket, hardly the perfect preparation for the World Cup.  It is almost four years since their last win - the shock victory over Pakistan at the 1999 World Cup.  They have suffered 25 defeats over four years, a world record that surpasses the one they established in losing their first 22 matches between 1986 and 1998.  In that period they have lost to each of the nine other sides that compete in Test cricket.  It is a sorry state of affairs and Bangladesh's place as the 10th Test-playing nation at cricket's top table has been seriously questioned.  For as well as their woeful one-day record, Bangladesh have yet to win a Test match in 17 outings.  Their present run of eight successive losses is also a record for the longer version of the game.  ""We still have a long way to go and need to work hard and concentrate harder to reach that kind of level.  ""But otherwise the morale in the side is fine and the discipline is excellent, which is very important.""  He is the third coach to occupy the post since Gordon Greenidge was sacked on the morning of that famous victory over Pakistan.  The West Indian was replaced by South African Eddie Barlow, a man held in high esteem in his adopted country before he left the post after suffering a brain haemorrhage.  Australian Trevor Chappell subsequently oversaw a relative downturn in the team's fortunes before he was, in turn, replaced by Kamal.  Never once in the run of defeats he has watched over has Kamal's team looked like winning.  A highest score of 226 was easily surpassed by Sri Lanka and would not have been enough in any of the 13 matches they have played over the last year.  And Bangladesh's bowlers are seemingly incapable of exerting any kind of authority over opponents.  However, a new losing streak is sure to start in the very next match and it remains to be seen how long it will last."
87,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
88,"Buddhists can worship both at home or at a temple. It is not considered essential to go to a temple to worship with others.  Buddhists will often set aside a room or a part of a room as a shrine. There will be a statue of Buddha, candles, and an incense burner.  Buddhist temples come in many shapes. Perhaps the best known are the pagodas of China and Japan.  Another typical Buddhist building is the Stupa, which is a stone structure built over what are thought to be relics of the Buddha, or over copies of the Buddha's teachings.  Buddhist temples are designed to symbolise the five elements:  All Buddhist temples contain an image or a statue of Buddha.  There are as many forms of Buddhist worship as there are schools of Buddhism - and there are many of those.  Worship in Mahayana tradition takes the form of devotion to Buddha and to Bodhisattvas.  Worshippers may sit on the floor barefoot facing an image of Buddha and chanting. They will listen to monks chanting from religious texts, perhaps accompanied by instruments, and take part in prayers."

Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.

92,"The UK ambassador to Argentina has been summoned to explain to officials in Buenos Aires why part of Antarctica has been renamed in honour of the Queen.  John Freeman was handed a formal protest note ""strongly rejecting"" the UK's claim to a piece of land known as the British Antarctic Territory.  The southern section was named Queen Elizabeth Land by Foreign Secretary William Hague on Tuesday.  The note claimed the area was part of the Argentine Antarctic sector.  It stated that the Argentine government ""strongly rejected"" Britain's right to rename the area.  Queen Elizabeth Land - which at 169,000 sq miles is almost twice the size of the UK - was previously unnamed, according to the British Foreign Office.  The UK first staked claim to the British Antarctic Territory in 1908. However, both Argentina and Chile insist they have prior claims to large areas of the same land.  The British Antarctic Survey has three scientific research bases in the territory and the Royal Navy's ice patrol vessel HMS Protector is stationed in the area for part of the year.  The 1959 Antarctic Treaty between 12 nations including Britain and Argentina, outlawed the establishment of new territorial claims in the Antarctic, but stated that it did not reject existing claims.  The Foreign Office said on Tuesday there was a precedent for naming parts of the continent after members of the British royal family.  East Antarctica is home to Princess Elizabeth Land, named after the Queen before she took the throne, and in 2006 an unnamed mountain range in the Antarctic peninsula was named the Princess Royal Range in tribute to the Queen's daughter."

94,"In 1917 people were astounded by harbours full of colourful ships. But some of the visual impact of Wilkinson’s camouflage is lost today in the black and white images we have of World War One. The striking colours can still be seen on hundreds of model ships in the collection of the Imperial War Museum.  These were made by the Dazzle Section at the Royal Academy of Arts, at Burlington House in London. Scale models were painted and used to test dazzle designs. They were placed on a rotating turntable and viewed through a periscope.  This allowed Wilkinson’s team to see how dazzle distorted a ship’s form as if it were travelling in different directions. Wilkinson believed that using strong contrasts, with light and dark greys, blues and greens, was most effective.  Wilkinson appointed dock officers at ports around Britain. They supervised the painting of ships from the finished designs. One dock officer was the artist Edward Wadsworth. He was a founder of Vorticism - a British art movement that grew out of Cubism.  The Admiralty experimented with various camouflage ideas during WW1. They had considered similar proposals by US artist Abbot H Thayer and the Scottish zoologist John Graham Kerr.  However, it was Wilkinson’s scheme that won them over. After the war the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors awarded him £2000 and recognised him as the creator of dazzle."

The QCA will also allow Network Rail and Flybe to award qualifications based on their workplace training schemes.  David Fairhurst, senior vice-president and chief people officer from McDonald's, said it was ""an important and exciting step"" for the company.

99,"Singer Sir Cliff Richard will face no further action over allegations of historical sex abuse, prosecutors say.  The Crown Prosecution Service said it had decided there was ""insufficient evidence to prosecute"".  Sir Cliff said he was ""obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close"".  But he said his naming by the media, despite not being charged, meant he had been ""hung out like live bait"".  Four men claimed offences took place between 1958 and 1983, the CPS said.  It is understood that one of the complainants intends to use the Victims' Right to Review Scheme to appeal against the decision not to bring charges.  In a statement, Sir Cliff said: ""I have always maintained my innocence, co-operated fully with the investigation, and cannot understand why it has taken so long to get to this point.""  He criticised the ""high-profile fumbling of my case from day one"".  ""Other than in exceptional cases, people who are facing allegations should never be named publicly until charged,"" he said.  ""I was named before I was even interviewed and for me that was like being hung out like 'live bait'.  ""It is obvious that such strategies simply increase the risk of attracting spurious claims which not only tie up police resources and waste public funds, but they forever tarnish the reputations of innocent people.""  Sir Cliff Richard's anger, mixed with relief, seeps from every line of his 366-word statement. The phrase ""hung out like live bait"" stands out - and it's designed to.  Sir Cliff wants to stop the reputations of other people being tarnished by publicity about allegations that haven't crossed the threshold for a prosecution, let alone been proven.  Although it's not police practice to identify suspects who haven't been charged - unless there are exceptional circumstances - names occasionally leak out and journalists sometimes discover the details through other routes.  A statutory ban on naming would put a stop to that. But would it allow sex offenders to get away with their crimes?  The concern is that if they hadn't been named in the media at an early stage, thereby emboldening other victims to come forward, some recently convicted celebrities would have got away with it.  Last year an independent investigation concluded that South Yorkshire Police should not have released ""highly confidential"" information to the BBC about a planned search of Sir Cliff Richard's home.  BBC film crews, including one in a helicopter, filmed the raid in August 2014.  In a statement, South Yorkshire Police apologised ""wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused"" to Sir Cliff by the force's ""initial handling of the media interest"" in its investigation.  The investigation is estimated to have cost ""in the region of £800,000"" including staffing costs, the force added.  ""Non-recent allegations are, by their very nature, complex and difficult matters to investigate and can take a considerable amount of time,"" it said.  ""We appreciate that waiting for a conclusion will undoubtedly have caused additional distress. However, it is in the interests of justice to investigate such matters thoroughly.""  Prosecutors received the full evidence file from police on 10 May, and BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said that meant the CPS had made its decision ""quite quickly"".  But he said the CPS had been working alongside the police for many months and there would now be ""serious questions for the police about why this has taken so long"".  He also said there would be ""serious questions for the BBC in terms of its coverage"".  Commenting on the claims against Sir Cliff, our correspondent said this ""isn't necessarily the end of the matter"", as the CPS maintains it must ""keep every case under review"" and every complainant has the right to a review of a decision not to bring charges - as one has said he will.  Responding to questions about the BBC's coverage, a BBC spokesman said: ""We applied normal editorial judgements to a story that was covered widely by all media and have continued to report the investigation as it developed including the CPS's decision today - which is running prominently across our news output.""  Conservative MP David Davis said Sir Cliff's case was ""another high-profile arrest which resulted in no prosecution"".  ""It is time for a complete review of police procedures surrounding high-profile sex abuse cases, and the publicity surrounding these cases,"" he said.  ""Whilst it is important to protect victims and maximise the chances of a successful prosecution, this must not result in the gratuitous destruction of people's reputation.""  Broadcaster and campaigner Nick Ross agreed with Sir Cliff's comment that he was ""hung out like live bait"".  He said police faced an ""impossible dilemma"" trying to balance justice for victims with ""trying not to have a witch hunt against people, some of whom are celebrities"".  But he said police did not handle Sir Cliff's case correctly, both in terms of Sir Cliff's name being released and by taking ""so long"" over the investigation.  Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck said he had not expected the CPS to come to any other decision when it came to his friend.  Tarbuck was released without charge in 2014 after his arrest over allegations of historical child sex abuse.  He said: ""I have known this man since we were 19 years of age, that's a long time, and I knew him then as a nice fellow.  ""I can tell you so many things about him, he's a decent human being. And why keep him waiting all this long?"""
100,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

103,"The NHS's drugs watchdog has released guidance which says Velcade's cost-effectiveness has not been proven and more research is needed.  Patients and health charities have condemned the ruling by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.  Velcade slows the advance of myeloma - cancer of bone marrow plasma cells.  An announcement from NICE had not been expected until Tuesday, but it was brought forward after the ruling was apparently leaked to the press.  Andrea Sutcliffe, who led the drug appraisal, said she was concerned at ""misleading coverage"" in some national newspapers.  ""It is one thing to criticise our decision not to recommend the use of this drug, but quite another to unfairly raise patient expectations about the effect of this drug and its availability in other parts of the UK,"" she added.  Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with myeloma in the UK each year.  The charity, Myeloma UK, said no patient in the UK should die without having access to the drug.  A trial last year showed Velcade (bortezomib) could extend the life expectancy of a patient by an average of six months more than standard treatment. Treatment costs about £18,000 per patient.  The drug was approved for use in Scotland in 2004, where it is mainly used as a last resort.  The Daily Mail earlier reported that it had seen a leaked ruling, which said the drug was more clinically effective than chemotherapy but was not regarded as ""cost effective"".  Jacky Pickles, 44, one of three women with bone marrow cancer from Keighley in West Yorkshire, is campaigning to get the drug approved.  ""If NICE is going to get away with not backing these drugs, then we will be stuck in the dark ages.  ""Isn't three years of my life worth anything?""  Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said the NHS had become a ""Scottish and a separate English health service"".  NICE, which regulates primary care trusts in England and Wales, has come under repeated fire over its decisions not to fund drugs.  The guidance will be formally issued before the end of the year.  Objectors however can appeal against their decision.  Ms Sutcliffe, who led the appraisal for NICE, said the committee had considered comments received during consultation on an earlier draft and had not changed its conclusion.  ""Although the drug is clinically effective compared with high dose dexamethasone, its cost-effectiveness has not been satisfactorily demonstrated and therefore further research is required.""  A NICE spokesman added: ""NICE has appraised 26 cancer treatments to date, and we have recommended 25 of them for use by the NHS.""  A spokeswoman for Myeloma UK said the charity was taking legal advice over the ruling.  ""This represents probably the single biggest setback in the history of the treatment of myeloma.""  She said the entire myeloma community, including Myeloma UK and the other charities involved in the appraisal, were devastated.  ""Velcade is a proven and licensed treatment and, quite simply, no myeloma patient in the UK should die without having access to it."""

105,"      Have your say    What happens when you take recently found recordings of a legendary (and now deceased) singer from West Asia and give them to a reggae obsessed, Italian DJ in London in 2007? The result is Dub Qawwali, an album released to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the passing of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.      Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (1948-1997) was a Pakistani Sufi praise singer whose music was called “qawwali”. Nusrat was the latest in an unbroken family lineage of qawwali singers stretching back over the last 600 years. Among other honorary titles bestowed upon him, Nusrat was called Shahenshah-e-Qawwali, meaning The Emperor of Qawwali. His multi-octave voice possessed such transcendent power that he became the first Pakistani musician to win over substantial international audiences. Gaudi DJs at clubs and events across the globe while somehow finding time to release – so far - eleven solo albums and soundtracks, plus 80 remix albums. He calls his personalized, flowing techno-reggae style “Gaudi-dub.”      In 2005 Gaudi began conceiving a new production—composing original music for unreleased Nusrat recordings recently discovered in Pakistan. Slowly building loops of sound around Nusrat’s huge, curling vocal, Gaudi began to build the project he states he is today most proud of: Dub Qawwali. “Stylistically, I’m trying to fuse different cultures, genres and sounds while keeping the unifying element of love,” Gaudi explains.      Considered a legend both in and outside of his home country, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was dubbed the ‘Elvis of the East’ and travelled the world promoting his unique brand of music inspired by the mystical faith of Sufi Islam. His untimely death left behind a vast repertoire of performances that have been sampled by countless DJs and composers over recent years. Even more potent in spreading the Nusrat legend has been the use of Khan’s voice on the soundtracks to several acclaimed films including Bandit Queen, The Last Temptation of Christ and Dead Man Walking. Directors find the huge (yet subtle) spiritual power conveyed by Nusrat appropriate accompaniment to cinematic scenes of great emotional impact.      Gaudi’s understanding of Jamaican dub technology lets him build an epic soundscape around Khan’s magisterial voice. Dub Qawwali takes the legendary art of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan into new musical territory.     Garth Cartwright    http://www.myspace.com/gaudimusic  CD Review on BBC Music     Read other people's comments then  Tell us what you think:     Naseem Zia, Australia  Please dont think like HALF GLASS IS EMPTY, I am surprised on Gaudi's selection. He selected the one and only one Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Best wishes Guadi Amir Khan, U.S.A  I am Pakistani/American World Music composer. So I was excited to learn that a European musician has utilized NFAK's recently found recordings in his new album.However, I am very disappointed to hear the result. I am sure Gaudi is good at what he does. Unfortunately, often, eastern classical singing cannot be simply backed with western chords. The result is that within the first 12 sec of the recording, NFAT sounds ""off"" (which I am sure he is not but rather due to orchestration/chords used in the background). The same thing happens again at 2:08 min into the recording.I think the overall sound or feeling of the song has to be appealing to your ears. In my humble opinion, this song is not. irfan pakistan  what a classic excellent remix...great gaudi keep it up. Rob Constantin  This album Dub Qawwali is simply fantastic! Excellent production, quality songs, fresh ideas and innovative style crossing reggae culture with sufi, for me this is a masterpiece! maya (BZH) & london  This album is just fantastic!!!I fly every day on it...beautifulthanks soo muchmaya DJ Don't F*** About  Gaudi rules, he should easily win one of your awards Sarah Flavell  No, no, no, no, no, no!This is an awful desecration of wonderful music. It sounds like someone is just playing bad reggae in the background. hasan khalid, US  i am a huge fan of Nusrat and Gaudi gave it new style, i liked it Naveed Awan Khan, London  Qawalli is timeless and doesnt but this album will age and is wrong. Its like the Bally Sagoo production which is rubbish. Gaudi has tried but it falls short. KANWALJIT SINGH INDIA  I LOVE NUSRAT SONGS. THIS SONG IS ALSO VERY EXCELLENT AS OTHERS SONGS OF NUSRAT stephan wikkler (Sweden)  I really love this cd, Sufi music and reggae music combined in the most beautiful way. the production in here is perfect!! Gaudi did an incredible job, and of course the inimitable voice of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan gives to this album a unique and ""top level"" touch! thank you. Stephan mark (brighton - uk)  this album Dub Qawwali is a gem!!! superb production by Gaudi, gives an extra amazing ""dub touch"" to the beautiful voice of a true legend: Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Gaudi/Khan a perfet combination! Shafat, Kashmir, India  Just Awesome!!!! Just a step behind Night Song. Remixed very well otherwise considering that Nusrat was around in this one as he was very much active during Night Song Karen B. Manchester UK  The album ""Dub qawwali"" by Gaudi + Nusrat is simply splendid! OMG when i bought it 2 months ago i couldn't believe my ears....reggae/dub and Qawwali music together in perfect symbiosis, Gaudi did an incredible job! The production of this album is truly immaculate! K.B.

106,"Jacob Zuma's advisers say he has nothing to hide South Africa's opposition leader has called for an investigation into whether President Jacob Zuma has broken the government's strict ethics code. This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "

109,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. You might not think you know much about Malawian music, but chances are you have heard it, or at least musicians influenced by it. African music in general first came to international attention in the 1950s with the popularity of ""kwela"" in the urban townships of Johannesburg. Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other    South Africa claims kwela for its own, but Kenny Gilmore, the director of a documentary that charts the history of Malawian music, says kwela was actually popularised in South Africa by Malawian musicians. ""The founding fathers of kwela kwela, a lot, not all of them, were Malawian, Malawi's never been that famous so nobody hears about them,"" he told the BBC World Service. ""Then they take a holiday down to South Africa, play some music, then, boom, the kwela kwela revolution [happens] and everybody thinks its South African."" Even a capella made famous by groups like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and more contemporary styles like Afro-jazz, both owe much of their distinct style to Malawian musicians according to Mr Gilmore. Malawi has nine tribal and linguistic groups, each possessing its own traditional dances and indigenous rhythms. ""True African music all comes from a traditional dance somewhere... and Malawi has got unique dances with unique rhythms,"" he says. He cites dances such as the Chewa's masked ""Gule Wamkulu"" (the big dance); the Ngoni's ""Ingoma"" war dance; the Beni military dance; and the healing ""Vimbuza"" spirit dance of the Tumbuka. But sadly only a handful of these were recorded in the 1940s and 1950s. Inspired by the late musical archivist Alan Lomax's famous journey to collect early blues recordings in the deep American South, for six weeks last year Mr Gilmore and his team travelled to villages across Malawi hoping to document and record some of this musical heritage, both past and present. He hoped to record as much as possible of what is left of these traditions before the memories and the music are gone forever. ""Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other. I went to Cape Town record shops, nothing, London, nothing, America, New York, nothing. These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms... we've got a unique musical melting pot    ""I'm on a mission to change it, I think the world needs to hear music and Malawi in the same sentence."" Using a portable studio, musicians from Malawi's most rural and remote areas were given the opportunity to record, promote and preserve their musical heritage. What the team got was a mix of individual musicians, small groups and cultural dance troupes, some of it purely traditional, some of it more of a fusion of traditional with contemporary and jazz influences. ""Sometimes you get these places in the world when you get these really interesting melting pots of cultures,"" says Mr Gilmore. ""You have the Congolese influence just above Malawi, you've got the Zambian influence to the west, you've got Zimbabwe to the east and you've got South Africa to the south. ""These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms - so all these great influences come into Malawi, mixing - we've got a unique musical melting pot."" Well-known Malawian musician and politician Lucius Banda says what makes Malawi music so special and deserving of greater interest is the way it has absorbed other influences into its musical traditions, making them their own. ""Malawi music is different, the special thing about Malawi music is [that it is] so cultural,"" he says. ""South Africa has disco and other Western influences. But Malawian music is quite unique in its own perspective."" One such influence which dramatically influenced the country's musical style was the banjo. The banjo was brought back to Malawi by soldiers who had served in East and Western African battalions during WWII. The banjo and blue grass influences were infused with traditional beats and dominated the country's music for nearly 20 years. In the 1970s jazz made an appearance in Malawi, then in more recent times has come gospel, reggae and pop influences. But what is most special about Malawi music according to Mr Gilmore is not the way it has fused the traditional with the contemporary - it is its energy and passion. ""I've played round the world and most of the times you get the beginning and it's warming up, people not getting too excited, then there's a kind of warm phase. ""In Malawi, from the first song boom, the whole club just kind of ignites in a fire bomb and it carries on until the last. ""The bartenders have left the bar, security have left the gate, someone's climbed over the fence you can see the whole nearby village dancing next to the gate, ""It's just a massive riotous party and it just leaves me filled with so much happiness.""

110,"Jacob Zuma's advisers say he has nothing to hide South Africa's opposition leader has called for an investigation into whether President Jacob Zuma has broken the government's strict ethics code. This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "
111,"On its formation on 1 September 1999, it was billed as the most powerful airborne fighting unit the country had ever produced.  It was born from the amalgamation of 24 Airmobile and 5 Airborne Brigades, and includes a combination of air assault infantry, parachute troops and helicopters.  The brigade, which has about 6,000 personnel, forms the Army's primary rapid reaction force, and is prepared to be deployed for use in any eventuality.  It is also a key part of the Joint Helicopter Command, which was formed in October 1999 and brings together the battlefield helicopters of all three services under a single joint command.  ""If you look across the world at air mobile forces, they're as good as anything the US can produce,"" said Major Charles Heyman, editor of Jane's World Armies.  In 2002, the brigade was instrumental in the establishment of the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in Afghanistan, the United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping force deployed to provide security after the downfall of the Taleban regime.  The previous year, it was deployed to Macedonia, where it spearheaded the Nato Essential Harvest operation to collect and dispose of arms and ammunition handed in voluntarily by the Albanian National Liberation Army.  The brigade has a joint Army and RAF headquarters based in Colchester, Essex, which provides the co-ordination for complex air assault operations.  It is made up of a large number of different units, including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Parachute Regiment and 3, 4, and 9 Regiments, Army Air Corps.  Its role is to move rapidly into enemy territory, paving the way for slower, heavier land-based forces.  Two battalions of the Parachute Regiment are always deployed alongside a battalion of regular infantry soldiers to make up the brigade's ground fighting elements.  ""The brigade has the ability to put three battalions of air assault infantry onto the ground, plus regiments of artillery with 18 light guns, and that's a pretty powerful force,"" said Major Heyman.  ""If a commander on the ground has a threat somewhere to his flanks, he can get the air assault brigade down to attack.  ""They are lightly armed and lightly equipped, so the heavy forces need to get there fast.  ""In the Gulf, you will probably see 16 Air Assault Brigade used for difficult tasks that need looking after fast before the heavy artillery get there.""  The brigade suffered a recent setback when the government's spending watchdog revealed that dozens of the army's new Apache Longbow attack helicopters were to be kept in storage for four years due to a shortage of trained pilots.  The initial £3bn order for 67 Apaches, placed with Westland Helicopters in 1995, was said to offer the greatest advance in Army effectiveness since the tank.  The helicopters were intended to be in service by December 2005, with 48 of them going to the aviation regiments of 16 Air Assault Brigade.  In the meantime, the Army Air Corps regiments operate Lynx helicopters armed with anti-tank TOW missiles, alongside Gazelle helicopters which provide reconnaissance capability.  For mobility, they depend on support Puma and Chinook support helicopters operated by the RAF.  The brigade also includes crucial combat support and combat service support units, all of which have a parachute-trained element.  The Pathfinder Platoon is the brigade's advance force and reconnaissance force. Its role includes locating and marking drop zones and tactical and helicopter landing zones for air landing operations.  Once the main force has landed, the platoon provides tactical intelligence vital to the operational decision-making within the brigade headquarters.  Artillery support is provided by 7 Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, while 9 Squadron of the Royal Engineers provide engineer support."

Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.

The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect.

114,"      Aspects of Iain Duncan Smith's CV, relating to his education, are inaccurate and misleading, an investigation by BBC Newsnight reveals.    The investigation into the Conservative Party leader's education and early career - broadcast at 10.30pm on BBC TWO last night (Wednesday 18 December 2002) - was presented by Michael Crick, author of the best-selling biography of Jeffrey Archer.    If any of the following material is used BBC Newsnight must be credited.       Iain Duncan Smith's biography on the Conservative Party website, his entry in Who's Who, and various other places, state that he went to the Universita di Perugia in Italy.    This is not true: his office now admit that he went to the Universita per Stranieri, which is also in Perugia.    The Universita per Stranieri - or University for Foreigners - was founded in 1921 and is a totally separate institution to the medieval Universita di Perugia, founded by the Pope in 1308.    Although the Universita per Stranieri is a respected language school, it did not grant degrees when he studied there in 1973, although some students attained diplomas.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now admitted to Newsnight that he didn't get any qualifications in Perugia or even finish his exams.       The first line of Iain Duncan Smith's biography, on the Conservative Party website, claims he was ""educated at Dunchurch College of Management"".    In fact, Dunchurch was the former staff college for GEC Marconi, for whom he worked in the 1980s.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now confirmed to Newsnight that he did not get any qualifications there either, but that he completed six separate courses lasting a few days each, adding up to about a month in total.    Newsnight has now spoken to 19 former tutors at Dunchurch. Most agree it is over-emphasising his experience at Dunchurch to describe it in the way he does.    John Garside, a former Dunchurch tutor, says: ""I'm puzzled, flattered, but puzzled. What we did was offer short courses... it was not a continuous form of education by any means.""    Newsnight has shown these details to some of Iain Duncan Smith's constituents in Chingford.    Several people assumed he must have been at both the University of Perugia and Dunchurch for several years, and obtained qualifications in either or both places.

118,"A historical sex offence inquiry into singer Sir Cliff Richard has ""increased significantly in size"" and involves ""more than one allegation"", police say.  The expansion of the investigation meant no date could be given for when it would be concluded, South Yorkshire Police's chief constable said.  It comes after officers raided Sir Cliff's Berkshire home last August.  Sir Cliff, 74, said he had no idea where the ""absurd and untrue"" allegations against him come from.  ""The police have not disclosed details to me,"" he said in a statement.  ""I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so.""  Sir Cliff has been interviewed about an allegation of a sex crime, but was not arrested or charged.  The BBC understands the original allegation relates to an alleged assault at an event featuring US preacher Billy Graham at Bramall Lane in Sheffield in 1985.  In a letter dated 10 February to Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, Chief Constable David Crompton said his force was in regular contact with Sir Cliff's lawyers.  That involved a ""verbal update about once a fortnight"", he said.  ""This is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since its inception. Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers are aware that there is more than one allegation,"" he said in the letter.  He added: ""It would be premature and potentially misleading to predict a likely date when it will be concluded, however, we are progressing as swiftly as possible.""  Parts of the letter were blacked out before it was released.  A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had not been presented with a file for a charging decision.  ""The CPS is providing early investigative advice in relation to allegations of sexual offences committed by a 74-year-old man, interviewed by police in August 2014,"" it said in a statement.  ""The allegations remain under investigation by South Yorkshire Police.""  It comes after an independent report concluded that police should not have released ""highly confidential"" details to the BBC about the planned search of Sir Cliff Richard's home.  A deal over the details was made when a BBC reporter told the force he knew they were investigating the star.  The report looked into a subsequent agreement between South Yorkshire Police and the BBC, which led to the raid being broadcast live.  South Yorkshire Police had ""interfered with the star's privacy"" by telling the broadcaster about the raid, the report said.  A statement from Sir Cliff's lawyers at the time said the coverage caused ""immeasurable harm"" to the star.  A BBC spokesman said the Home Affairs committee had ""already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story.""  South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Dr Alan Billings, said six recommendations in the report ""will be implemented""."
119,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

122,"He said the decision to take action in Iraq should have been made by the Security Council, not unilaterally.  The UK government responded by saying the attorney-general made the ""legal basis... clear at the time"".  Mr Annan also warned security in Iraq must considerably improve if credible elections are to be held in January.  The UN chief said in an interview with the BBC World Service that ""painful lessons"" had been learnt since the war in Iraq.  ""Lessons for the US, the UN and other member states. I think in the end everybody's concluded it's best to work together with our allies and through the UN,"" he said.  ""I hope we do not see another Iraq-type operation for a long time - without UN approval and much broader support from the international community,"" he added.  He said he believed there should have been a second UN resolution following Iraq's failure to comply over weapons inspections.  And it should have been up to the Security Council to approve or determine the consequences, he added.  When pressed on whether he viewed the invasion of Iraq as illegal, he said: ""Yes, if you wish. I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter from our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal.""  Mr Annan's comments provoked angry suggestions from a former Bush administration aide that they were timed to influence the US November election.  ""I think it is outrageous for the Secretary-General, who ultimately works for the member states, to try and supplant his judgement for the judgement of the member states,"" Randy Scheunemann, a former advisor to US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told the BBC.  ""To do this 51 days before an American election reeks of political interference.""  A UK foreign office spokeswoman said: ""The Attorney-General made the government's position on the legal basis for the use of military force in Iraq clear at the time"".  Australian Prime Minister John Howard also rejected Mr Annan's remarks, saying the legal advice he was given was ""entirely valid"".  The BBC's Susannah Price at UN headquarters in New York says Mr Annan has made similar comments before.  He has said from the beginning the invasion did not conform with the UN charter - phrasing that was seen as a diplomatic way of saying the war was illegal.  Our correspondent says Mr Annan's relationship with the US might be made a little uncomfortable for a while following his comments, but both sides are likely to want to play it down.  US President George W Bush is due to speak at the UN General Assembly next week.  Mr Annan also said in the interview the UN would give advice and assistance in the run-up to the elections, but it was up to the Iraqi interim government to decide whether such a vote should go ahead.  He warned there could not be ""credible elections if the security conditions continue as they are now"".  The UK foreign office spokeswoman said there was a full commitment to hold elections in January.  Election and political party laws had already been passed and an independent electoral commission established.  ""The task is huge and the deadline tight, but the Iraqi people clearly want elections,"" she said.  On Wednesday, the head of the British army General Sir Mike Jackson said national elections in Iraq were still on track.  On Monday, Iraq's interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said elections must go ahead as planned although he conceded the violence might stop some Iraqis voting.  However, a day later a car bomb close to an Iraqi police station in central Baghdad killed 47 people and gunmen opened fire on a police minibus in Baquba, killing 12."
123,"Former Top Gear host Richard Hammond has been flown to hospital after a crash while filming in Switzerland.  The 47-year-old was on a practice run for a race in an electric car for Amazon Prime show The Grand Tour.  Mr Hammond ""climbed out of the car himself before the vehicle burst into flames"", the show said in a statement.  Co-host Jeremy Clarkson tweeted that it was the ""most frightening"" accident he had ever seen but said Mr Hammond, who fractured a knee, was ""mostly OK"".  The show's statement said Mr Hammond had been involved in a ""serious crash"" after completing the Hemberg Hill Climb in Switzerland, where a race takes place on Sunday.  He had been driving a ""Rimac Concept One, an electric super car built in Croatia, during filming for The Grand Tour Season 2 on Amazon Prime, but very fortunately suffered no serious injury"".  Mr Hammond was ""conscious and talking"" after the crash, the show said, and had been flown to hospital in St Gallen ""to be checked over"".  ""Nobody else was in the car or involved in the accident, and we'd like to thank the paramedics on site for their swift response.  ""The cause of the crash is unknown and is being investigated,"" the statement added.  The Hemburg organisers said the official race would take place as planned on Sunday.  A statement said: ""The vehicle left the track and landed in the meadow.""  They added that rescuers had been ""very fast"" to reach the scene.  The crash comes 11 years after Mr Hammond nearly died when he lost control of a Vampire dragster while filming for Top Gear.  He was in a coma for two weeks after the accident at Elvington Airfield, near York.  Mr Hammond, who had been driving at speeds of up to 288mph (463km/h), suffered brain injuries but made a full recovery.  A ""catastrophic disintegration"" of the jet car's front tyre, probably caused by an object like a nail, caused the crash, a BBC report later concluded.  In early March 2017, Mr Hammond said he had fallen off a motorbike ""many times"" while filming an episode of The Grand Tour in Mozambique and ""banged my head"".  But he also said he was ""fine"", although Mr Clarkson told the Sun newspaper that Mr Hammond had ""hurt himself quite badly""."
124,"The Church of Christ The Redeemer is Lurgan's most recognizable landmark. This Church Of Ireland, gothic building is situated in Church Place, in the centre of Lurgan and can be seen miles away from the town. The original church was sited in Shankill Graveyard, which is half a mile from the present building. The old church became too small for the congregation and had fell into dilapidation.   So in the early 18th century a new church was built in ""The Green"" in Lurgan. The site of Shankill graveyard itself and the old church has historic importance dating to pre-christian times. It is also known that there was a Mediaeval church here which was probably destroyed in the ""Nine years War"" at the end of the 16th Century.  William Roulston explains that in the early 17th Century the land was granted to the Brownlow family, who founded Lurgan. They restored the church as a place of worship for the influx of English settlers during the plantation. The most dominant feature in the churchyard is the Brownlow Mausoleum where ""the most noble family of Abercorn"" are buried. Not surprisingly, the graveyard has changed several times and the earliest legible headstone today dates back to April 1690. Kieran Glendinning has written a considerable number of documents about this graveyard and he talks to Mary Ferris about the Brownlows and some of the other families who are buried here. He also tells the fascinating story of one Margorie McCall, a woman who's famed in these parts for having been buried twice! Mary spoke next to Mrs Greer. The Greers, who were formerly the McGregors, were proscribed in their native Scotland and settled in Cumbria. They came to Northern Ireland during the plantation - originally to Dungannon and Moy - and then to Lurgan in 1757 where they bought the family home at Woodville which still stands today. Mrs Greer who continues to live in the family home has plotted the family tree which is so complex she used a roll of wallpaper to write it on! She tells Mary Ferris of how her recent ancestors were involved in both Whiskey and Linen... Woolsey Gracey is the archivist at the Church of Ireland and has a great understanding of local history and heritage. The archived records go back to 1675. He shows us the minutes of a vestry meeting just after the first church on the site was built in 1725. Many of those whose signatures appear on the document are buried outside in the churchyard. One of them is Rev Arthur Ford who was rector in the parish for twenty years. He insisted in his will that he would be buried in the North end of the graveyard in a bid to dispel an old superstition that the Northern end was 'unholy ground' and only for paupers. Particularly interesting are the records Woolsey holds of the deaths and burials during the period of the famine, which was at its worst in 1847. Charles Brownlow, first Baron of Lurgan died of Typhus whilst helping the poor and needy of the town. John Neill, a member of the congregation is a solicitor for the firm which is responsible for the Brownlow estate. He tells how his recent ancestors raised funds to buy new bells for the church. Gerard McAtasney is the author of the book ""This dreadful visitation"" which recounts stories surrounding the famine in the Lurgan and Portadown area. He tells us how the Shankill graveyard had more burials than any other graveyard in Ireland at that time. Conditions in the workhouses were appalling and many new recruits were brought in and given clothing left behind by those who had died of disease. The survival rate was dismally low. The workhouse graveyard was bursting. Often there were 5 bodies to one coffin and up to 30 bodies to a grave. When it eventually overflowed, a 'paupers pit' was opened in the Shankill graveyard. These would have been unmarked graves. At the height of the famine there were 492 burials in Shankill which included 233 'workhouse burials', the worst workhouse death-rate in Ireland. Today no-one really knows whereabouts in the Shankill graveyard the workhouse bodies are buried."
125,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.

The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

130,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Hiroshi Yanagihara cannot forget the day he was forced to confess to a crime he did not commit. A taxi driver, he had been detained on suspicion of attempted rape. The police interrogation was so relentless, he says, that it brought him to the brink of suicide. ""When I first started saying I was innocent the intimidation and the pressure on me grew stronger,"" he said. ""They kept saying, 'Your family is giving up on you, they're very disappointed in you.' They kept repeating over and over. Mr Yanagihara spent two years in jail for a crime he was later cleared of ""I got to the stage of there's really nothing I can do about this. Anything I say they're not going to listen to, there's nothing I can do. I just said yes, one word yes. That led them to arrest me."" That confession was enough to see Hiroshi Yanagihara convicted and spend more than two years behind bars, even though a footprint at the scene did not match his shoe size. He was only cleared after he was released, when another man was found guilty of the crime. His is one of several high-profile cases of forced confessions in Japan. Amnesty International has now called on Japan's new government to immediately implement reforms of the police interrogation system to avoid such miscarriages of justice. Suspects can be held for up to 23 days before they are charged in what the campaign group says is a brutal system that has no place in modern Japan. The conviction rate is more than 99%, often based on confessions. Amnesty International says some are extracted from suspects under duress. In its manifesto the Democratic Party, which won a general election in August, pledged to introduce full videotaping of interrogations. Japan's courts have a conviction rate of more than 99% - although it cannot be compared directly to other countries because there is no plea bargaining. At the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did?    Prosecutors usually proceed with a case only if they are sure they will win and a confession has been called the king of evidence. ""The detainee has absolutely no access to his defence lawyers, has no idea how long the interrogation session would go,"" said Rajiv Narayan of Amnesty International. ""And this also involves many, many hours of repeated questions and sometimes sleep deprivation, and where the detainee is given the impression he would only be released once he confesses. ""In that kind of system, what's of great concern is the confessions extracted could even be used to sentence a person to death."" Amnesty International says it is impossible to know how many miscarriages of justice there have been. A British man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC about his experience of police detention in Japan. ""The first thing I was told, and this was by the officers, was you're going to hell with your eyes open,"" he said. The man had been caught trying to smuggle two kilograms of cannabis into Japan. He admits his guilt, but claims he was interrogated for up to 16 hours a day for weeks on end as officers tried to get him to confess to further crimes. He says he was handcuffed, tied with a rope to his chair and not allowed to use the toilet. Every day he was presented with papers in Japanese, which he did not understand, and told to sign them. Each time he refused, he says, things got worse. ""He says to me, 'Just co-operate and you'll find things will be just co-operate with him',"" the man said. ""He wanted me to agree that I'd brought marijuana to Japan before, I'm in a gang. They started shouting at me. They tried to force me to sign the papers. They put one inmate in my cell and he started to do all the kung fu like he was going to attack me."" The police and the Ministry of Justice were unable to respond to these particular allegations because the charity representing the prisoner wants to maintain his anonymity with a view to future compensation. However, they were prepared to discuss the case of Hiroshi Yanagihara, wrongly convicted of attempted rape. ""Regarding this case the prosecutor's office investigated the problems in August 2007 to prevent it happening again,"" said Ministry of Justice spokesman Yoshio Nakamura. ""They released the report. And we believe the report will be used in order to prevent it from happening again."" Trial by jury has just been introduced in Japan, and campaigners hope it will cast light on the justice system. But Amnesty International says this is not enough. They are calling on Japan's new government to immediately fulfil an election pledge to videotape interrogations to stop abuses in police detention. There is no commitment to reduce the length of time suspects can be held by police. ""Wrongful convictions should not happen, and I hope they won't in the future,"" said Keiko Chiba, the new minister of justice. ""People in the justice system and politicians knew there was a problem and were concerned. ""But at the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did? And they thought there's no way the investigators would do such a thing. That's why it didn't come to changing it as much as it should have done.""     "
131,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
132,"For Sir Alex Ferguson, it is the most critical week of the season so far.  Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday followed by the return leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich. And all to be negotiated without Wayne Rooney.  Away from events on the pitch, the even more important battle for the future ownership of the club is also reaching a critical point.  Despite last week's announcement from the Red Knights that there would be no takeover bid until the end of the season, the campaign to wrest control from the Glazer family gathers momentum.  A Manchester United supporter wears a scarf in the colours of the anti-Glazer movement. Credit: AP  Earlier this week, leading Knights figures held a key strategy meeting to discuss the final structure of the bid being drawn up by Japanese investment bank Nomura and City lawyers Freshfields. According to well-placed sources, the favoured option is now for a £1.2bn bid working in two phases.  Having decided to retain the £500m bond recently used to refinance the Glazers' debts, the Knights are discussing a plan whereby two thirds of the remaining £700m would be raised from 30-40 super rich United supporters. The final third would come from fundraising among ordinary fans. If necessary, the Knights say they will borrow money to complete the bid.  In phase two - once the club was secured - a general share offer would be launched allowing supporters the chance to own a stake in their club.  Once this structure is agreed, Nomura will begin the process - perhaps as early as next week - of asking the 30 or 40 wealthy Knights to commit their cash.  So far, we only know the names of four of the Knights. They are Jim O'Neill, a lifelong United supporter and head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, Paul Marshall from hedge fund Marshall Wace, Mark Rawlinson from Freshfields and Guy Dawson from Nomura.  All four have major City reputations and, perhaps more importantly, serious United credentials. In the case of O'Neill, he was on the United PLC board at the time of the Glazer takeover in 2005 and is close friends with Ferguson and chief executive David Gill.  But, even if this wealthy group of United fans can raise the money, would the Glazers sell?  Despite rumours of financial problems at home, the American family have insisted publicly they are in it for the long run. They have to say that.  But privately, too, they have been sending the same message to the Knights. Investment bank Rothschild, which advised the Glazers on their £800m takeover, has not been retained at this stage but it is understood it has made informal contact with the Knights in the last few weeks to tell them they are wasting their time.  Besides, as the club points out, United under the Glazers are hardly a disaster story. Since the takeover, Sir Alex's side have won the Champions League and three Premier League titles. They have increased commercial income by 65% and have, to date, only taken out £23m, although it is worth noting the bond issue allows them to take out many millions more in the future.  So the key questions are these:  Can the fans actually raise the money to persuade the Glazers to sell?  Until we see the colour of the Knights' money, this is impossible to predict but the sums involved would make it very difficult for ordinary fans to do it on their own.  A recent survey suggested 83% of United fans would be prepared to put an average of £600 towards the takeover. With 150,000 supporters now signed up to the Manchester United Supporters Trust that would amount to just £90m - 7.5% of what is required. That is not insignificant but fans would need to be prepared to put in thousands and thousands of pounds - not hundreds.  Even if the Knights were successful, what would actually change?  If it is accepted United are doing well on the pitch - in spite of Cristiano Ronaldo's sale to Real Madrid - and the club is making more money than ever, the touchstone issue is the £716m of debt the Glazers have saddled the club with.  But the Knights say they will keep the £500m bond. The interest payments currently draining out of the club at around £60m a year will not stop. And the longer-term problems - replacing Ferguson and rebuilding an ageing squad - will need even more money to solve.  Will the wealthy Knights just hand over the club to fans?  Rich men do not become rich through philanthropy. They will expect a return. The challenge for O'Neill and the Knights is persuading multi-millionaires to put their fortunes into the club and then allow their shares to be sold on to supporters for little if any profit. Is there not a danger that United could simply be swapping one group of wealthy owners for another?  For now, most United fans will worry only about results on the pitch - and with their team still in the hunt for a remarkable domestic and European double, they will leave the Knights to their plotting.  The crunch point will come when it becomes clear where the £80m United received for selling Ronaldo to Real has gone. Quarterly results - one of the requirements of the bond issue - due to be published on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange before the end of the month will show that the money is still sitting in the bank.  But if, as everyone suspects, it is eventually used to start paying down the Glazer's £202m of PIK (payment in kind) loans and not for strengthening Ferguson's team in the summer, then that's the point when things could really start to get interesting"
133,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
134,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

136,"It is from here that Rahul Gandhi makes his political debut, the constituency which elected his father, Rajiv, to parliament.  An hour away is the larger town of Rae Bareilly, which Rajiv's widow, Sonia, is contesting.  The news that two Gandhi family members have decided to stand in these two seats has delighted local residents.  ""We can never forget what the Gandhi family has done for Rae Bareilly,"" says Bharat Lal Yadav, who owns a restaurant on the main road leading into the town in Uttar Pradesh state.  ""After they stopped contesting, we have been forgotten. But now we are looking forward to backing one of them again.""  But it is the decision to field Rahul Gandhi that has really excited people in Amethi, 80km (50 miles) down the road.  ""We were really hoping that Rahul would contest from Amethi,"" says Rajendra Prasad as he scans the local newspaper.  ""It is the age of the youth - time for the younger generation to lead the way,"" he explains as he sips milky tea from a stained glass.  ""The Gandhis are the only ones who motivate the people of this town to rise above caste and religious lines,"" he says as everyone in the teashop nods in agreement.  ""Look at us here - a cross-section of voters with upper and lower-caste Hindus and a Muslim. We will all support them.""  Amethi has a long association with the Gandhi family, with Indira Gandhi's second son, Sanjay, first contesting from here in 1980.  When he died in a plane crash, his brother, Rajiv, was voted in from Amethi during a by-election.  ""It was then that the children, Rahul and Priyanka, began making visits to the constituency along with their mother, Sonia,"" says Dharmendra Shukla, a local Congress Party official.  Mr Shukla escorted the Gandhi siblings during a visit in January, when they came on a trip to test the political waters.  ""They spent a lot of time asking us questions, checking the progress of projects that their mother had initiated and generally had a really good time.""  Amethi was represented in the outgoing parliament by Sonia Gandhi, who has now chosen to shift to the neighbouring constituency of Rae Bareilly.  As you drive through town the Gandhi presence is very evident.  The town's main college was set up by her husband Feroze, who was also elected from Rae Bareilly.  ""You could describe this as the Gandhi's pocket borough,"" says BP Singh, a retired government employee.  He explains that the town grew in prominence with its long association with the Gandhis.  ""In 1969 my house rent was five rupees,"" he said.  ""Now it is 2,500 rupees. If that is not a sign of our growth and prosperity, what is?"" he asks with a smile.  The family association is what brings the Gandhis back to these two constituencies in a state where the fortunes of their Congress Party is fast dwindling.  In the last elections, Congress won a mere 10 seats out of a total 80.  ""If anyone other than a Gandhi had stood from here, we would have thought of voting for someone else,"" says Ramesh Kumar, a tailor.  ""But now there is no question.""  This thinking is put in perspective by Ameeta Singh, who belongs to one of Amethi's most influential families and is herself a politician.  ""People here do not look at the Gandhis as mere politicians,"" she says.  ""There is a strong emotional bond between them. You cannot break it."""

As part of the works, more than 500m (1,640ft) of both Regent Street and Oxford Street are being redesigned with wider pavements and new lighting.

He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "

145,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

149,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""

Regent Street first lit up in 1954. Prompted by an article in the Daily Telegraph commenting on how drab London looked at Christmas, the retailers and businesses which made up the Regent Street Association organised and financed the first display. Oxford Street and its corresponding Association followed suit in 1959. The recession of the late1960s hit London's centre at Christmas. The lights went out in Oxford Street in 1967 and four years later Regent Street also succumbed. In 1978, financial and electronic power was restored. The resulting laser show devised by Oxford Street was a brave attempt but deemed a little too dangerous. 1979 saw the resumption of normal practices and since then funding has always been a contentious issue. In some years Regent Street has seen interesting varieties as the lights take inspiration from their sponsor. Disney's Aladdin and Cameron Mackintosh's Celebration of West End Musicals have starred. But, for the last three years, we've had Flashing Crowns with Stars in Regent Street and a hotch potch of Christmas motifs in Oxford Street. Other incidents of note, aside from the comings and goings of the funding saga, have been the fall of an 18-inch electric candle from its fitting over Oxford Street in 1959. It happened again later that same year, but this time the falling article was 15ft long and this time it caused a death. In 1963, the lighting up of London was postponed as a mark of respect to the recently assassinated John F Kennedy. And in 1989, the great switch on in Oxford Street bowed to the power of pop celebrity, waiting several weeks past its usual mid-November date for Kylie Minogue to make a window in her hectic schedule. Frankie and Pete follow in a long line of celebrity sparklers Despite the controversy, the lighting ceremony remains a matter of national interest and celebrity aspiration. To be invited to be chief switch thrower in Oxford Street means you are currently the people's favourite, take pop stars the Spice Girls and Peter Andre for example. And in Regent Street, the lucky candidate joins a long line of Royals and choice notables such as former Prime Minister, John Major, and champion jockey Frankie Detorri.

162,"The former members of Lostprophets have started a new band following the conviction of frontman Ian Watkins on child sex charges last year.  Stuart Richardson, Lee Gaze, Luke Johnson, Mike Lewis and Jamie Oliver are working with former Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly.  Speaking to Radio Cardiff, Rickly said that Watkins' former bandmates deserved ""a second chance"".  He has compared No Devotion's music to The Cure and New Order.  Geoff Rickley, a US songwriter and producer, is best known for being the former lead singer of Thursday.  The 35-year-old released six studio albums with the band and has released one with his current group United Nations with a second due in 2014.  Speaking about Watkins' sexual abuse prison sentence and how it affected the other Lostprophets members, Rickly said: ""I think if ever there was a group of people that needed a second chance, it's those guys and they're going to take full advantage of it.  ""People don't really think of what happens to the other members. That took away their life.""  Rickly confirmed that he was working with the band through his label, Collect Records.  ""It's been my honour to work with them on their new band from a label perspective,"" he added.  ""People are not going to know what hit them when the new band comes out.  ""It's like everything I grew up on; a little bit of New Order, a little bit of Joy Division, little bit of The Cure. It's just so forward-thinking.""  Ian Watkins was sentenced to 35 years in prison at the end of last year for a string of child sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby.  He was given a 29-year jail sentence and will spend a further six years on licence.  Watkins, 36, from Pontypridd, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to 13 child sex offences.  His two co-defendants, who are the mothers of children he abused, were jailed for 14 and 17 years.  Earlier this year it was reported that he was seeking leave to appeal against the length of his jail term.  Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube"

169,"Agatha Christie is the best-selling fiction author of all time A collection of previously unheard recordings of crime writer Agatha Christie talking about her life and work has surfaced in Devon after lying undiscovered for 40 years. The reels of tape, over 13 hours long, were discovered by the author's grandson in a cardboard box during a spring clean-out at Christie's former home in Torquay. They date back to the 1960s and are working notes for her autobiography which was published posthumously in 1977. But the recordings go into far greater detail about some aspects of Christie's life than the finished book, with descriptions of what life was like in wartime Britain, her honeymoon with her second husband and the reason why she would never let her legendary sleuths Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple meet. Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady    Christie also provides some insight about how she came to create Miss Marple, the elderly spinster who acts as an amateur detective and appears in 12 of her novels. ""Miss Marple insinuated herself so quietly into my life, that I think I hardly noticed her arrival. I just had the idea, possibly for a series of six short stories for one special magazine, and I chose the people who I thought would be suitable. ""An old spinster lady living in a village, the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my grandmother's cronies... old ladies like I had seen in the private hotel in South Kensington... and old ladies like I had met in so many villages where I had gone to stay as a girl."" When it comes to solving mysteries Miss Marple is shrewdly intelligent She is adamant that Miss Marple is not based on her grandmother but admits there are similarities. ""She had this in common with my grandmother, that although a completely cheerful person she always expected the worst of anyone and everything - and with almost frightening accuracy usually proved right."" The tapes, recorded on a Grundig Memorette reel-to-reel tape recorder, are believed to have been made at Christie's home, and in some sections her dogs can be heard barking in the background. Again and again, she hits the pause button as she takes a moment to think. Her relaxed, informal tone is charming to listen to and a rarity, as she disliked being interviewed, was shy and wary of media attention. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Only a handful of recordings of her voice are known to exist - including a 1955 interview for the BBC and a 1974 recording for the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive in which she recounts her experiences in a World War I dispensary which gave her a working knowledge of poisons - something which would feed into her murder mysteries. Unfortunately, the tapes give no insight into one of the most intriguing parts of her life - the mysterious episode in 1926 when, having been told by her first husband Archie that he wanted a divorce, Christie drove off alone from their Sunningdale home, abandoned her car, then took a train to Harrogate in Yorkshire where she registered herself at the Hydro Hotel as Mrs Neele (the name of her husband's mistress). She spent 12 days in Harrogate, shopping, lunching in tea rooms, having beauty treatments and even singing with the hotel's dance band, whilst becoming the subject of a nationwide search by the tabloid media. It's also wonderful to hear that latent humour and the assurance in her voice, as she talks about these ridiculously familiar characters    Her family now assume that she had a nervous breakdown, and after she was found she was diagnosed by doctors as suffering from amnesia. The media frenzy over her disappearance is thought to be one of the reasons why she tended to avoid interviews and became increasingly reclusive. Matthew Prichard, Agatha Christie's grandson, says the tapes bring an overwhelming sense of of his grandmother. ""She has little mannerisms, like the minor cough in the middle of sentences, which I had forgotten about - and all this comes back to you,"" he says. He points out that his grandmother was shy - and would never have recorded her thoughts if there had been anyone else present. She describes it as a jolt, hearing Christie's voice 32 years after her death. ""It was so nice to hear again, the essence of Agatha. She really belongs to an England that no longer exists - and you can hear that in the tapes. It's also wonderful to hear that latent humour and the assurance in her voice, as she talks about these ridiculously familiar characters."" Overwhelmingly, there is a sense from the recordings of a feisty and determined personality. ""People never stop writing to me nowadays to suggest that Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot should meet. But why should they meet? I'm sure they would not like meeting at all,"" she says. ""Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot - a professional sleuth - would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world."" Crime writer Agatha Christie at an unknown event in July 1967 ""They are both stars and stars in their own right. I shall not let them meet, unless I feel a very sudden and unexpected urge to do so."" And speaking about The Mousetrap - famed as the longest running play in London's West End since its first performance in 1952 - she said she thought its success was ""90% luck"" and that ""there was a bit of something in it for almost everybody"". She recollects that she predicted it would not run for more than eight months. And she admits she initially had some doubts about it. ""I must say that I had no feeling whatsoever that I had a great success on my hands... I went with some friends and I thought, 'I've let it have too many humorous situations, there's been too much laughter, it's taken away from the thrill'. ""I was a little depressed about it, I remember.""     "

171,"Half of all fatal road crashes occur on one-tenth of Britain's roads, according to the Road Safety Foundation charity.  Its report, covering 28,000 miles of A-roads and motorways, says on average Scotland has the highest-risk highways, followed by parts of northern England.  The most dangerous individual road was the A537 between Macclesfield, Cheshire, and Buxton, Derbyshire.  The charity wants government spending to be targeted at improving safety on the most dangerous roads.  Its report, entitled Saving Lives for Less, suggests the high cost of emergency services and hospitals could be avoided by spending small sums in accident blackspots.  The foundation is the British arm of the European Road Assessment Programme, the sister organisation of EuroNCAP, which measures car safety.  It examined accident data relating to roads across Britain. Among its conclusions were:  The most improved road was named as the A40 between Llandovery and Carmarthen.  Improved junctions and markings, along with resurfacing with high friction, anti-skid treatments, saw the number of serious accidents fall from 27 between 2003 and 2005 to seven in the following three years.  Foundation director Dr Joanne Hill said such simple, well-planned engineering measures were relatively inexpensive.  ""Not only can Britain reduce road deaths and serious injuries but, by targeting a relatively small mileage of high-risk roads, we can do so with good economic returns.  ""Too often we pay for emergency services, hospitals and care for the disabled rather than taking easy steps to put road design faults right.""  A quarter of the road length in the survey was in Scotland, where one in nine fatal crashes occurred.  On average ratings across all the regions, Scotland had the most dangerous motorway and A-road network, with 12% in the higher risk categories.  But when it came to the highest risk individual roads, none of the Scottish ones made Britain's top 10.  The study, using figures from 2006 to 2008, divided the road network into ""significant sections"" of various lengths.  It then calculated the risk by dividing the number of fatalities on a given section by the number of kilometres driven on it.  The report said the A537 through the Peak District, known as the Cat and Fiddle, had severe bends, steep falls from the carriageway and was edged by dry-stone walls or rock face for almost all its length.  Fatal and serious collisions on the route - popular with tourists, goods vehicles and motorcyclists - rose from 15 in the three years to 2005 to 34 between 2006 and 2008.  Most crashes happened at weekends during the summer in dry, daylight conditions.  The report also names the highest-risk roads when crashes involving motorcyclists are excluded, with a stretch of the A18 in North East Lincolnshire topping the list.  Most of these roads are single-carriageway A-roads, with nine of the 10 in northern England."

This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure.

176,"               The Duke of Kent has presented a replica orb and cross to Dresden's cathedral to mark the 55th anniversary of the allied bombing of the German city.      The gilded orb and cross replaces those destroyed in the devastating bomb attack by Allied planes on February 13, 1945, which killed tens of thousands of civilians.       [It is a] symbol of peace and reconciliation for the future    The raid, by 796 Lancasters and nine Mosquitos, was part of the Allied policy of saturation bombing German cities.      Ata a ceremony attended by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Saxony Governor Kurt Biedenkopf, the Duke praised German efforts to rebuild the former East German city and the famous Frauenkirche Lutheran cathedral.    Duke of Kent (right) is president of the Dresden Trust   The Duke described the orb and cross as a potent symbol of suffering, reconciliation and rebirth.      They will stand 300ft above the ground, topping the stone dome of the 18th-century baroque cathedral, which collapsed after two days of Allied bombing, when the temperature of the masonry reached an estimated 1,000C.      Crowning feature      The eight-metre high orb and cross were made in London by goldsmiths Grant Macdonald and paid for by British donations to the Dresden Trust, of which the Duke is president.    One of the craftsmen, Alan Smith, is the son of a British pilot involved in the 1945 Dresden raid. Mr Smith, 52, led an eight-month project to recreate the 23ft crowning feature of the Frauenkirche.      His late father, Frank, was a pilot in 57 Squadron which carried out the raid.      The chairman of the Dresden Trust, Alan Russell, said: ""I think what we have been able to do has had a very considerable healing effect not only for the Dresdeners but also for the British people involved,"" he said.      The Foundation for the Reconstruction of the Frauenkirche was formed in 1990 and money has been raised for the fund in Germany, America and Britain.      The rebuilding programme began in 1993 and is scheduled to be completed in 2006 - Dresden's eighth centenary."
177,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.

178,"A Dutch court has fined the owner of the Netherlands' biggest cannabis-selling coffee shop 10m euros (£9m, $13.3m) for breaking drugs laws.  Owner Meddie Willemsen, who was tried along with 15 staff of the Checkpoint coffee shop in Terneuzen, was also sentenced to a 16-week prison term.  He was convicted for keeping more than the maximum tolerated amount of 500g (18oz) of drugs at the cafe.  Checkpoint served up to 3,000 people a day before being closed last year.  On a couple of occasions, police found 200kg (440lb) of cannabis when they raided the coffee house.  Willemsen was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, but was released as he had already spent the time in jail ahead of the trial.  He and his staff were convicted of breaking drugs laws, exporting drugs and membership of a criminal organisation.  The 10m euro fine was lower than the 28m euro fine prosecutors had asked for because of the ""role of the authorities"" in allowing Checkpoint to grow unchecked.  ""Checkpoint could not have expanded as much as it did without collaboration from the municipality of Terneuzen,"" a court statement said.  The town, close to the Belgian border, put up road signs showing the way to the Checkpoint and built a car park near it to reduce traffic congestion in town.  Though technically illegal, the Netherlands decriminalised the consumption and possession of under 5g (0.18oz) of cannabis in 1976 under an official ""tolerance"" policy."
179,"Southlake Moor on the Somerset Levels has been restored to a floodplain after £350,000 of investment.  The aim is to make Southlake Moor more wildlife friendly and allow safe control of flood waters during winter.  It is part of an £8m project by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board (IDB) to restore ten floodplains in Somerset.  The work has involved building and upgrading sluice gates, watercourses and culverts which manage water levels and prevent rivers from overflowing.  Floodplains on the levels have been drained for generations for agricultural use.  In recent years, work has been carried out by the drainage board, the Environment Agency and conservation charities to restore this land to its natural state to promote biodiversity and prevent flooding.  Nick Stevens, chief executive of Parrett IDB, said the levels were used for storing water when rivers are unable to cope with the volume of water.  It is then allowed back into the rivers when the river levels start to go down.  He added: ""Although in itself Southlake doesn't provide huge quantities of water - we are talking of many millions of cubic metres of water that needs to be stored - Southlake proves piece in the jigsaw.""  Southlake has the potential to store 1.2 million cubic metres but at the moment holds 600,000 cubic metres and the floodplains across the levels have a potential to store millions of cubic metres of water.  The restoration work has been welcomed by the conservation charity, RSPB.  Richard Archer, RSPB Somerset and Severn Estuary conservation officer, said: ""Standing on Burrow Mump, it's fantastic to once again see these meadows flooded and alive with thousands of waterbirds.  ""Returning land to favourable condition also has benefits for those that farm the area as well as local communities who can now enjoy an amazing new wildlife spectacle.""  The Parrett Internal Drainage Board has carried out the work in conjunction with the Environment Agency, which is responsible for a number of sluice gates and Natural England which owns the land."

182,"A rare painting which hung in a spare room in Stirlingshire for decades because the original owner didn't like it has sold for £225,000 at auction.  The 20in by 16in oil painting, Pink Roses by Samuel John Peploe, was sold on Thursday night by McTear's in Glasgow.  Peploe is one of Scotland's most popular artists.  His piece The Coffee Pot holds the record for the most expensive Scottish painting, selling for £937,250 in 2011.  Pink Roses was acquired in Glasgow by the late father of the Stirlingshire-based seller in the early 1960s, when his wife sent him out to buy a painting of some roses.  When he returned with the Peploe, she told him she didn't like it and it was relegated to the spare room.  The seller, who wanted to remain anonymous, could not recall how much was paid for the painting 50 years ago - but said it was ""not significant enough to remember"".  Brian Clements, managing director at McTear's Auctioneers, said the painting had attracted a lot of interest.  He said: ""Pink Roses is a significant example of Peploe's work and the price paid reflects that.  ""It may not have been to the original owner's taste but they are delighted with the price achieved and we were delighted to have the privilege of selling such an important work of art.""  Peploe was a Scottish post-impressionist painter and, along with John Duncan Fergusson, Francis Cadell and Leslie Hunter, was a founding member of the group that became known as the Scottish Colourists.  He is noted for his still life works, which show influences from Manet."
183,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
184,"Malcolm Glazer, the billionaire who led a controversial takeover of Manchester United, has died aged 85.  The Glazer family purchased United for £790m in May 2005 amid protests from the Premier League club's fans.  ""Malcolm Glazer never set foot in Old Trafford but was a figurehead of that controversial takeover of Manchester United. ""In terms of practicalities and the day-to-day running of the club, very little will change and the business will continue to be run on the same basis it has been for a number of years. ""The club's debt payments have been reduced, but I think it is fair to say fan anger over those debts remains and will not go away.""  However, they went on to win five Premier League titles and the Champions League under his ownership.  The New York-born American's sons, Joel and Avram, took over the day-to-day running of the club after their father suffered a stroke in April 2006.  ""The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United are with his family,"" said a spokesman for the Premier League club.  The club's Dutch striker Robin van Persie, 30, tweeted: ""My condolences go out to the Glazer family and friends.""  The Glazer family retain a 90% share in United - split equally among Glazer's six children - with 10% listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Glazer, who never actually set foot inside Old Trafford, gradually bought out United shareholders between 2003 and 2005.  His takeover was largely funded by loans secured against the club's assets, a move that took them heavily into debt and sat uneasily with many fans at Old Trafford.  Manchester United Supporters' Trust vice-chair Sean Bones said: ""It would be inappropriate for me to make any comment about the death of Malcolm Glazer as I didn't know him or his family personally.  ""However, as a supporter, I am aware of the detrimental effect the Glazers have had on the football club and the huge debt that has been placed on Manchester United.""  Supporters' group Shareholders United were one of the most vociferous anti-Glazer voices during the takeover, and in the aftermath.  In 2010, a group of lifelong United fans made up of City bankers and lawyers set up the Red Knights consortium in an attempt to buy the club with the support of fans, but their plans failed.  The club had no debts before the Glazer family takeover but now owe around £400m. Yet, despite a turbulent 2013-14 season which resulted in the sacking of manager David Moyes, United still generate record revenue, with turnover set to exceed £418m in the 2013-14 financial year.  Football finance expert Professor Tom Cannon from the University of Liverpool told BBC Radio 5 live: ""He had a massive impact on the club. He loaded them with a lot of debt while at the same time building up their commercial side until it became a global phenomenon, so two very striking differences.  ""Floating 10% of the club on the New York Stock Exchange made the club more exposed to the vagaries of the stock market and some would argue one of the factors that led to the dismissal of David Moyes was the fact that the stock market was declining, the price was declining.""  Glazer was also the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he will be remembered much more fondly for turning one of American football's least successful franchises into Super Bowl winners following his takeover in 1995.  Former Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden, who led the team to that Super Bowl triumph, said: ""He was a friend and a trailblazer. I'll miss him and I thank him for believing in me. My condolences to the Glazer family and to the Bucs organization.""  The Glazers are a very close knit but large family. There's no doubt Malcolm Glazer was the patriarch who led the initiative and in a sense held them together. One of the concerns now might be whether you get the situation you've seen in the past, even in English football, where you get divided opinions within members of the family - some wanting to sell, to cash in, some wanting to hold on. That's going to be the big question in the short to medium term and of course the next few weeks are crucial for Manchester United and it may be there's a hiatus while they sort out that kind of issue.  Hall of Fame defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who played a major part in the Super Bowl XXXVII success, tweeted: ""One time for my owner & great man #RipBoss.""  Buccaneers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy also took to Twitter to pay tribute: ""Rest in peace to the driving force that helped transform the organization that changed my life forever. Forever grateful!!""  NFL commissioner Roger Goodell added: ""Malcolm Glazer was the guiding force behind the building of a Super Bowl-champion organisation.  ""His dedication to the community was evident in all he did, including his leadership in bringing Super Bowls to Tampa Bay. Malcolm's commitment to the Bucs, the NFL and the people of the Tampa Bay region are the hallmarks of his legacy.""  Glazer's business career started when he took over the family watch-parts business aged 15, following the death of his father.  He invested in other businesses and acquired a diverse portfolio of international holdings and public companies, including First Allied, Zapata Corporation, Houlihan's Restaurant Chain, Harley Davidson, Formica, Tonka, Specialty Equipment and Omega Protein.  Glazer is survived by his wife Linda, his six children and 14 grandchildren."

186,"The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court A newspaper group is paying £550,000 to the parents of Madeleine McCann after it settled a libel case over reports of her disappearance. Express Newspapers' titles, including the Daily Express, Daily Star and Sunday Express, are also printing front-page apologies. They say they were wrong to suggest the couple, of Rothley, Leicestershire, were responsible for Madeleine's death. The McCanns say the money will go to the Find Madeleine campaign. In a statement read out on behalf of the McCanns at the High Court on Wednesday, they said they were pleased that Express Newspapers had admitted the ""utter falsity"" of the numerous stories written about them over many months. Their spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, added that the allegations had caused them ""great distress"". It is understood that the sum donated to the campaign doubles the amount left in the fund. Madeleine disappeared, days before her fourth birthday, during a family holiday in the resort of Praia da Luz, in the Algarve, on 3 May last year. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, have been named as suspects in the case by Portuguese police but have always denied any involvement. Madeleine McCann went missing in Portugal in May 2007 The settlement was confirmed at a High Court hearing, although the amount of damages was not formally disclosed. It came after Wednesday's editions of the Daily Express and Daily Star both carried front-page apologies under the headline, ""Kate and Gerry McCann: Sorry"". The Express said it accepted that a ""number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up"". It also acknowledged there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support that theory. The paper added that Mr and Mrs McCann are ""completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance"". The Star said it was making a ""wholehearted apology to Kate and Gerry McCann for stories suggesting the couple were responsible for, or may be responsible for, the death of their daughter Madeleine and for covering it up"". Further apologies are expected in the publications' sister Sunday titles at the weekend. The libel action related to more than 100 stories across the four titles, including 42 printed in the Daily Express. I think this is an amazing stand-down, u-turn, by the Express newspapers    All four titles are published by the Express Newspapers group, which has agreed to all the McCanns' requests. It is also paying all their costs. A spokesman for the company said: ""We have nothing to add to what will be said in court and in our titles."" The McCanns' lawyers said that some of the newspapers' articles were ""grossly defamatory"". Richard Bilton, BBC News special correspondent, said one of the couple's representatives had said the response of the newspaper group was ""much more responsible than they were perhaps initially with these articles"". Media commentator Roy Greenslade said that for two national newspapers to carry front-page apologies at the same time was ""unprecedented"". ""I think this is an amazing stand-down, U-turn, by the Express newspapers,"" he said. The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court ""I think when people realise that more than 100 stories have been complained about as being grossly defamatory, it will annihilate the Express' readers sense of trust and credibility in their newspaper."" Media lawyer Paul Gilbert, from Finers Stephens Innocent, said the courts encourage early settlement of defamation cases. ""Clearly the Express' lawyers felt this was a case they should settle without a high-profile trial - which it would be - and as a result have saved considerable costs,"" he said. ""It certainly is a warning sign to newspapers in the future - if they're going to speculate, they've got to be very careful about what they speculate about."""

189,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.

The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.

Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".

The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect.

194,"The UK ambassador to Argentina has been summoned to explain to officials in Buenos Aires why part of Antarctica has been renamed in honour of the Queen.  John Freeman was handed a formal protest note ""strongly rejecting"" the UK's claim to a piece of land known as the British Antarctic Territory.  The southern section was named Queen Elizabeth Land by Foreign Secretary William Hague on Tuesday.  The note claimed the area was part of the Argentine Antarctic sector.  It stated that the Argentine government ""strongly rejected"" Britain's right to rename the area.  Queen Elizabeth Land - which at 169,000 sq miles is almost twice the size of the UK - was previously unnamed, according to the British Foreign Office.  The UK first staked claim to the British Antarctic Territory in 1908. However, both Argentina and Chile insist they have prior claims to large areas of the same land.  The British Antarctic Survey has three scientific research bases in the territory and the Royal Navy's ice patrol vessel HMS Protector is stationed in the area for part of the year.  The 1959 Antarctic Treaty between 12 nations including Britain and Argentina, outlawed the establishment of new territorial claims in the Antarctic, but stated that it did not reject existing claims.  The Foreign Office said on Tuesday there was a precedent for naming parts of the continent after members of the British royal family.  East Antarctica is home to Princess Elizabeth Land, named after the Queen before she took the throne, and in 2006 an unnamed mountain range in the Antarctic peninsula was named the Princess Royal Range in tribute to the Queen's daughter."

Tony Blair's New Labour had gained a staggering 179-seat overall majority in the Commons as the Conservatives were tossed aside by the voters.  The election also saw the Liberal Democrats put in a remarkable performance, more than doubling their number of MPs despite taking a reduced share of the vote compared with 1992.  In the election's aftermath, commentators speculated whether it was at all possible for the Conservatives to overturn such a huge majority in a single election."
196,"Allan Menzies, 22, claimed that he was ordered to kill Thomas McKendrick by a character in the movie Queen Of The Damned.  He said at the High Court in Edinburgh that he was told he would be rewarded with immortality and become a vampire ""in the next life"".  Mr Menzies said he was visited in his West Lothian home by the female vampire Akasha, who was played in the film by the late US singer Aaliyah.  He was giving evidence on the sixth day of his trial.  Mr Menzies denies killing Mr McKendrick, who he had known since he was four years old, on 11 December last year and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.  The jury has been told that his offer to plead guilty to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility was rejected by the Crown.  Mr Menzies, from Fauldhouse, said Akasha visited him in his bedroom.  ""In general terms, she started off having conversations with me and it ended up that I had basically agreed with her that if I murdered people I would be rewarded in the next life,"" he said.  He said that he believed Mr McKendrick and another friend, Stuart Unwin, wanted to kill him.  ""I heard it in my mind, basically, that the two of them were plotting to kill me,"" he said.  Mr Menzies told the court he had killed Mr McKendrick using a bowie knife, a kitchen knife and a hammer.  But he said his father Thomas and Mr Unwin had been responsible for disposing of the body.  He said he had not told the police about this to protect his father.  Mr Menzies told the court that Akasha had continued to visit him after the killing, but he rejected demands that he kill more people.  He also said the film character had visited him at Carstairs, where he has been a patient for five months.  Mr Menzies said he was ""disappointed"" that there were no other vampires in the state hospital.  Earlier, two psychiatrists said that Menzies was not suffering from a severe mental illness at the time of the attack.  However, that was rejected by consultant forensic psychiatrists Derek Chiswick and Colin Gray.  Dr Chiswick, 58, said he believed Mr Menzies suffered from an ""anti-social personality disorder"".  But he said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he was a paranoid schizophrenic."
197,"Pre-tax half-year profits rose by 15% to £315m this time from £274m last year, better than expected by analysts.  Granada said it would propose a two-for-one share split, and increase its dividend to 5.9p.  Granada chairman Gerry Robinson said the company was on track for double digit profit growth for the next three years.  ""Granda's figures are certainly the pick of the bunch today, with a good dividend and a stock split too,"" one dealer said.  The results were boosted by strong results from the group's media division, which made a profit of £122m, largely because of increased advertising revenue from television.  Programme sales are expected to increase by 20% in the second half of the year.  The hotel and catering business also had a strong start to the second half of the year.  Sales at its restaurants were up 10% in April and May, while sales at the budget hotel chain Travelodge showed a 13% increase.  Granada acquired the hotel business of Trusthouse Forte, but had encountered earlier criticism that it was slow to dispose of unwanted businesses.  The company said that subscriptions to its digital pay TV channel had been increasing dramatically since it launched the offer of free decoder boxes.  ""Sales are going extremely well since the digital decoder offer, especially through our own Granada rental shops,"" Mr Robinson said.  There were 110,000 subscribers by the end of March - far below the target of 2 million by 2001.  Granada said that if ONdigital was successful, it could float the venture as a separate company.  It is jointly owned with Carlton, another leading ITV company."
198,"Europe's Industry Commissioner Gunter Verheugen said: ""There is not now and never will be any requirement to drop imperial measurements.""  The decision will not affect current law on metric measurements, but means imperial equivalents can be used too.  It follows years of wrangling between London and Brussels over metrication.  The commission has kept extending the deadline for the UK to complete the full transition to the metric system, with the most recent deadline being 2010.  This would have meant setting a deadline for ending the traditional delivery of pints of milk - and the sale of pints of beer in the UK's pubs.  Every one of the UK's road signs would have had to be changed from miles to kilometres - a move which opponents warned would be both expensive and confusing.  But it was the move, begun in 2000, to make the UK's market traders sell their produce in kilograms rather than pounds and ounces which caused outrage among traditionalists.  Sunderland grocer Steve Thoburn inspired the ""metric martyr"" movement with his defiance of the order to abandon the imperial measurements.  In 2001, he was convicted for having weighing scales which had only imperial measurements.  He died unexpectedly from a heart attack three years ago and, while the campaign he founded failed to win traders the right to ignore metric weights altogether, it has brought some results  Under the plans which have now been scrapped, even displaying the price of fruit and vegetables in pounds and ounces would have become grounds for a criminal prosecution.  Mr Verheugen's role includes trying to improve the EU's reputation in member states - and in an interview with the BBC, he admitted the EU had been making itself unpopular on an issue that did not really matter.  ""I organised a huge consultation, and the result was that industry told us there was no problem with the existing system.  ""I want to bring to an end a bitter, bitter battle that has lasted for decades and which in my view is completely pointless. We're bringing this battle to an end.""  However, campaigners on both sides of the debate have played down the significance of the announcement.  John Gardner, director of the pro-imperial British Weights and Measures Association, said: ""I've seen the European Commission statement and what they're saying is it will be allowed to use imperial measurements as additional information.  ""We think that the European Commission statement is extremely misleading. From our point of view the situation hasn't changed and the campaign goes on.  ""If a trader tries to conduct his business in just imperial measurements that will be illegal.""  The UK Metric Association said the statement does not mean that traders can go back to weighing and pricing in imperial measures, and it will be ""business as usual"".  Chairman Robin Paice said: ""While we regret this proposal to prolong the current muddle of metric and imperial units, it will only delay but not stop the inevitable move toward all-metric shopping.  ""Many of the big supermarkets have already stopped giving obsolete imperial prices, and we expect this trend to continue. There is no question of going backwards.""  Science and Innovation Minister Ian Pearson said he welcomed the commission's proposal.  ""This shows that the commission has listened to our views and recognised the strong arguments that we've made for maintaining dual metric and imperial labelling and the right for the UK to decide on the future use of pints and miles,"" he said.  ""We know how important this is to the British people and are grateful for the commission's support for this use to continue.""  The UK first mooted plans to convert to an all-metric system in 1965.  That led to generations of schoolchildren being promised that they would be the last ones who would have to learn two different systems."
199,"Californian authorities have decided against prosecuting former astronaut Buzz Aldrin after he punched a documentary maker who claimed his moon missions were faked.  Mr Aldrin, famous for his participation in the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, hit Bart Sibrel after he approached the former astronaut outside a hotel in Beverley Hills, Los Angeles and demanded he swear on a Bible that the landing was not staged.  Mr Aldrin responded by punching Mr Sibrel, but said he merely struck out to defend himself and his stepdaughter, who was with him at the time.  Beverly Hills police investigated the incident, which occurred 9 September, but said that the charges were dropped after witnesses came forward to say that Mr Sibrel had aggressively poked Mr Aldrin with the Bible before he was punched.  Witnesses also told police that Mr Sibrel had lured Mr Aldrin to the hotel under false pretences in order to interview him.  Deputy District Attorney Elizabeth Ratinoff told Reuters news agency that a videotape shot by a cameraman hired by Mr Sibrel had shown the film-maker follow Mr Aldrin, calling him a ""thief, liar and coward"".  Mr Sibrel handed over the tape to police investigators, but as Mr Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and Mr Aldrin had no previous criminal record, no charges were filed.  Mr Sibrel says his new documentary proves the Apollo 11 landings were faked by the Nasa space agency in order to fool the then-Soviet Union into thinking the US had beaten them in the space race.  The two countries had been embroiled in a desperate race to reach the moon, with the US initially trailing after the Soviets became the first to send a man into space and orbit the earth.  Mr Aldrin, the second man after Neil Armstrong to set foot on the moon in the Apollo 11 mission, is one of America's most famous space pioneers.  A former US Air Force pilot who flew in the Korean war, Mr Aldrin joined Nasa space agency in 1963.  Since his retirement from Nasa, Mr Aldrin has dedicated much of his time to publicising space travel for civilians."
200,"Egypt's president, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, has announced the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company to provide funding for the construction of the Aswan High Dam.  The British Government and French stockholders who own shares in the Suez Canal Company have reacted with shock to the news.  In a two-and-a-half hour speech delivered to a mass gathering in Alexandria, President Nasser said the Nationalisation Law had already been published in the official gazette.  He said all company assets in Egypt had been frozen and stockholders would be paid the price of their shares according to today's closing prices on the Paris Stock Exchange.  Twelve Egyptians have been appointed members of a special board which will manage the newly-nationalised company.  The Suez Canal is a key waterway for world trade and an important source of revenue for Britain.  The Suez Canal Company, which manages the waterway, is legally Egyptian but, in 1869 was granted a 99 years' concession.  It was not due to revert to the Egyptian Government until November 16, 1968.  President Nasser, who took control of Egypt following a Coup d'Etat four years ago, has been implementing a nationalisation programme in the country, and was vehement in his criticism of the West.  He said 120,000 Egyptians had died building the canal but Egypt was receiving just a tiny proportion of the company's £35m annual earnings.  President Nasser's decision to nationalise the Suez Canal company comes following Britain and America's withdrawal of financial assistance towards the Aswan Dam.  It is understood the USSR agreed last month to provide an unconditional loan towards the project."
201,"John Demjanjuk, an elderly former Ohio car worker who was born in Ukraine, was finally convicted of Nazi war crimes after decades of fighting attempts to bring him to justice.  Before his latest trial, in Germany, he was famously deported from the US to Israel in 1986 to face allegations that he had served as a camp guard nicknamed Ivan the Terrible at Treblinka.  He was convicted and sentenced to death. But he was reprieved a few years later after new evidence appeared.  But back in America, decades later, an immigration judge ruled there was enough evidence to prove he had been a guard at other Nazi camps, and he was sent abroad for trial again in 2009.  The Munich case, in which he was given a five-year jail sentence, is expected to be Germany's last big war crimes trial.  Born Ivan Demjanjuk on 3 April 1920 in the Ukrainian village of Dubovi Makharintsi, he was raised under Soviet rule.  A burly man, he worked as a tractor and lorry driver on a Ukrainian collective farm.  Little can be said with certainty about Mr Demjanjuk's activities during World War II.  He joined the Red Army like millions of others, and was serving in eastern Crimea in 1942 when he was captured by the Germans.  At least three million Soviet soldiers are believed by historians to have died in German prison camps, many of them left to starve. ""I would have given my soul for a loaf of bread,"" Mr Demjanjuk said later in court.  At his trial in Israel, he testified that he had been held at a camp in Chelmno, Poland, until 1944 before being moved to another camp in Austria where he joined a Nazi-backed unit of Russian soldiers fighting communist rule.  But according to German prosecutors, between March and September 1943, he was in fact involved in the murders of tens of thousands of Jews at the Nazis' Sobibor death camp in Poland.  They said they had obtained hundreds of documents and a number of prosecution witnesses.  ""For the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who Demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers,"" said Kurt Schrimm, head of the special office investigating Nazi crimes.  After the war, Demjanjuk lived in southern Germany, working as a driver for various international refugee organisations, according to Germany's Spiegel magazine.  In 1952, he emigrated to the US with his wife and child, eventually settling in Cleveland, where he worked as an engine mechanic at a car plant.  He was naturalised as a US citizen but his citizenship was temporarily removed after a US judge ruled in 1981 that he had lied in his citizenship application about his wartime activities.  Israeli prosecutors requested his extradition in 1983. They believed Mr Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible - one of the most infamous guards at Treblinka.  Ivan had helped operate the gas chambers and personally murdered hundreds of prisoners, hacking many of his naked victims to death with a sword, according to witnesses.  A US court rejected his appeal against deportation in 1985. The court dismissed doubts cast over the authenticity of an ID card, which the defence said was a forgery.  The card showed that Mr Demjanjuk belonged to the Trawniki unit - an SS-trained section of non-German volunteers which was tasked with persecuting and murdering Jews.  In Israel, Mr Demjanjuk's lawyers argued that he was the victim of mistaken identity and challenged the accuracy of the memories of five Treblinka survivors who identified him as Ivan the Terrible.  However, the Trawniki ID card helped sway judges in the prosecution's favour and in 1988 he was found guilty of crimes at Treblinka and sentenced to hang.  Five years later, the conviction was quashed in 1993 by Israel's Supreme Court, after evidence emerged in post-Soviet Russia that another Ukrainian - Ivan Marchenko - had in fact been Ivan the Terrible.  However, Israel's chief justice was careful to avoid declaring Mr Demjanjuk innocent, noting that there was ample evidence that he had served as a guard in other camps.  Mr Demjanjuk had his citizenship restored upon his return to the US as a free man but in 2002 it was revoked once again.  A district court judge ruled that there was sufficient reliable evidence to prove that he had been a concentration camp guard, if not at Treblinka.  Appeals followed but a court eventually ruled that he should be deported to his native Ukraine, Germany or Poland.  In November 2008, state prosecutors in Munich announced they had enough evidence to prove his involvement in the murders of Jews at Sobibor.  He was formally charged in Germany with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder.  He fought extradition - protesting that he was too ill to travel. He turned up in court in a wheelchair or lying motionless on a stretcher. But the court was shown secretly recorded evidence of him walking unaided, and ruled against him. He was deported to Germany in May 2009.  His defence there again questioned the authenticity of the Trawniki ID card - but the German court rejected its request to suspend the trial."
202,"The first new railway station to be built in West Yorkshire in 10 years has opened.  At Apperley Bridge, between Leeds and Bradford, around 50 people gathered on the platform for the first train to Bradford from the new station.  The original station closed 50 years ago as part of the Beeching cuts. Its replacement has cost about £8m.  Two trains between Leeds and Bradford Forster Square or Skipton will run hourly Monday to Saturday.  Martin Bairstow was one passenger on the first train from the station and brought the original station sign with him.  He took it he said for ""safe-keeping"" when the station shut.  Mr Baistow said his trip had been ""something I've been waiting for for 50 years"".  He had also been on the last train to the station in March 1965.  The Beeching report of 1963 recommended taking an axe to about a third of the rail network - 5,000 miles of track, including hundreds of branch lines, 2,363 stations and tens of thousands of jobs.  Apperley Bridge is one of three new stations in West Yorkshire with others in Kirkstall Forge and Low Moor set to open next year."
203,"As you enter the gardens you’ll see ahead of you a lake and to your right the bandstand which still has regular entertainment performing on it.  The gardens did not start out like this. Before the Earl of Scarborough turned them into The Pleasure Gardens they were a coal yard, and before that the area was used for storage by the Tyneside Cargo boats after the landed on Skegness sands.  During the Victorian years when a visit to a seaside resort was becoming fashionable it was essential for the visitor to enjoy a stroll around the gardens and listen to the band.  It’s not just the gardens that were designed by him but he also employed an architect to help plan around the existing Skegness. As well as the gardens and the pier the Earl of Scarborough envisioned promenades with tree lined streets. In essence, he wanted to create the perfect coastal holiday destination on the East coast.  These days the sort of entertainment you might see in the park is not only brass bands but many other musicians performing different styles. There’s also storytelling, treasure hunts, gala days, art exhibitions and craft weekends.  Continue through the park and leave by another gate at the opposite to which you entered. You will find yourself on Rutland Road. From here turn left and head towards Lumley Road."
204,"The Mancunian musician first expressed an interest in taking part after Daz Sampson's song, Teenage Life, came fifth from last in the 2006 contest.  ""I was horrified but not surprised to see the UK fail,"" he said. ""Why didn't they ask me?""  The BBC says it is in talks with the singer to write and possibly perform a track for this year's contest in May.  But a spokeswoman for the corporation warned ""nothing is confirmed at the moment"".  The BBC has approached several other high-profile acts as it tries to ""up the ante on the calibre of artists"" taking part in the annual competition, she added.  The band also released a series of acclaimed albums, including The Queen is Dead, which regularly feature in critics' all-time best lists.  They split up in 1987, after which Morrissey launched a successful solo career, scoring 10 top 10 singles in the UK.  He has been linked to the Eurovision song contest before, working with the UK's first winner, Sandie Shaw, in the 1980s.  Last year, the video for his You Have Killed Me single featured a pastiche of the kitsch Eurovision competitions of the 1970s.  However, to make it through to the real Eurovision, Morrissey would have to win the public's approval in the qualifying stages of the competition.  Former Blue singer Antony Costa and glamour model Jordan have seen their hopes dashed at this stage in previous years.  The winning entrant will compete against 23 other European nations in the final, which will be held in Helsinki after Finnish hard rock band Lordi won the contest in 2006."
205,"Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness addressed reporters after the meeting The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed water charges will be deferred for another year. Details of a £500m funding boost were revealed as the cabinet met for the first time in almost five months. Ministers have also decided to liberalise restrictions on building in the countryside, replacing the controversial PPS 14 policy. The Executive also reached agreement on the creation of a new education and skills authority. The announcement came as the first and deputy first minister revealed details of Wednesday's negotiations with Prime Minister Gordon Brown. We have had probably the longest meeting of the Executive    The Executive will use £400m of the money secured from Mr Brown to cover the cost of the 12-month water charges deferral, while £100m will go towards addressing a range of other funding pressures. The Northern Ireland Executive intends to meet every week until a five-month backlog is addressed. First Minister Peter Robinson told a news conference that difficulties caused by the credit crunch took up more than half of the discussion time. ""We have had probably the longest meeting of the Executive,"" he said. ""All of the ministers were fully engaged and there was support from all of the ministers for the work that we had done in securing the arrangements with the prime minister and Treasury. ""This perhaps takes some of the pressure off the finance minister (Nigel Dodds) as we move onto the next stage of the credit crunch."" Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said they had dealt with many important matters. ""The issue of the deferral of water charges, the establishment of the Education and Skills Authority, the change from PPS 14 to what will be known as PPS 21 which will allow for development in the countryside in a very balanced way with the need to protect our environment - that should be a boost to local construction workers. ""The abolition of prescription charges is another important development which has been mandated by the Executive as a whole."" On Tuesday, the DUP and Sinn Féin came to an agreement on policing and justice, an issue which had been causing stalemate. The last time the executive met was on 19 June, after which Sinn Féin refused to sign off on meetings until there was progress on issues such as the devolution of policing and justice. A definite date has still not yet been set, but Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness have agreed a series of steps designed to bring this about.     "
206,"Irish League club Crusaders have won the right to legally challenge the government's £25m funding of a redevelopment project for Windsor Park.  The south Belfast venue is Northern Ireland's national football stadium, but is owned by Linfield who are rivals of Crusaders in the Irish Premiership.  Crusaders claimed that the government money could unfairly extend Linfield's dominance in local football.  On Wednesday they were granted leave to seek a judicial review.  Lawyers for both the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and Irish Football Association argued the challenge was premature and should be thrown out.  A judge ruled that Crusaders had established an arguable case that the redevelopment of Windsor Park amounted to unlawful state aid for their rivals Linfield.  Mr Justice Treacy granted leave to seek a judicial review on that point, and on an alleged lack of transparency around the proposed scheme.  But he stressed his decision had no bearing on the ultimate outcome to the case.  The Windsor redevelopment is part of a plan that also includes the Ulster rugby ground at Ravenhill and the GAA's Casement Park.  A total of £110m has been set aside for the three building projects through the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.  Crusaders claimed the upgrade to Linfield's stadium breached European Union competition laws and constituted government aid.  They argued the proposals would create extra revenue streams and give an unfair advantage to a club already in a financially dominant position.  Lawyers for the Department insisted no final commitment had been given to provide the £25m earmarked in the Stormont Executive's Programme for Government.  Although the process was said to be at an advanced stage, the court was told stadium funding depended on agreement on a range of sporting and social integration projects.  Counsel for the IFA backed the contention that the challenge was premature.  Alternatively, if proceedings were brought against a policy first unveiled in 2011 it was out of time, he argued.  But Mr Justice Treacy said: ""It is in my view arguably clear that the government has made a decision in respect of a funding package to redevelop Windsor Park, build a new stadium at Casement Park and redevelop Ravenhill.""  Granting leave on the state aid ground of challenge, he confirmed: ""The court holds that the challenge is not defeated at this stage on grounds of prematurity or delay.""  The judge also allowed a claim about a lack of transparency on the process to progress, but threw out a further allegation that it breached fair competition laws.  He stated: ""I should emphasise that the grant of leave says nothing at all as to how the case will ultimately be resolved following the provision of and consideration of all relevant evidence.  ""The grant of leave merely signifies the case is arguable or worthy of further consideration.""  Outside the court Crusaders director Mark Langhammer gave a cautious welcome to the verdict.  He said: ""Our aim in all of this has always been to get a balanced and competitive league.  ""At this stage, what this leave hearing decision secures is access to the information on which DCAL and others made their decision.  ""We will not get ahead of ourselves, we will simply get the information first and discuss it with our members.""  The Irish FA had hoped building work on the Windsor Park redevelopment would start later this year and be completed in 2015."
207,"Neil Marshall is the director of critically acclaimed horror films Dog Soldiers and The Descent. Director Neil Marshall was keen not to rely on too many CGI effects He's back with his third feature, Doomsday - a post-apocalyptic science fiction action movie starring Rhona Mitra, Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell. In 2008, a deadly virus infects Scotland and Hadrian's Wall is rebuilt to keep the country in quarantine. A quarter of a century later the Reaper virus resurfaces in England, so an elite group of police officers, headed by Eden Sinclair (Mitra), is sent to Scotland in search of a cure. So how much is Doomsday a tribute to those post-apocalyptic movies of the 1980s? It's an open love letter to that whole period of time - the whole ethos was that we were all expecting to die in a nuclear war any second. In the cinema we had Mad Max and Escape from New York coming out; on Top of the Pops we had the Wild Boys video and everybody dressed up like Mad Max; on TV we had Threads and The Day After. It was such a rich period and I was soaking it all up. I thought it was time for me to splurge it all back out onto the page and make something that was like that. There's a lot of classic 80s music in the film. At what point did you decide to use Spellbound by Siouxsie and the Banshees for Sean Pertwee's death scene? Spellbound has long been one of my favourite songs and I've been itching to get it into a movie. It was something that came up in the edit. I was thinking of some Sex Pistols tracks to put in there but we tried it with Spellbound and that just worked so well. I'd actually wanted to put a Banshees track [Into The Light] on the end of The Descent but the producer didn't like the music very much and we couldn't afford it. With Doomsday we had a bit more money to spend on things like that. The only Doomsday song that was there from the start was Two Tribes [by Frankie Goes To Hollywood]. That was written in the script. Rhona Mitra has appeared in TV shows Boston legal and Nip/Tuck Sean Pertwee met an equally sticky end in Dog Soldiers. He must be wondering what you're going to do to him next? Yes, poor old Sean! I must give him something more substantial next time. In one way he was gutted his part was short but he was really pleased because he got the best thing in the whole movie - it's a showpiece death scene. How much reaction has there been to the scene where the rabbit gets shot to pieces? When I was in Brussels, the French and Belgian journalists were all wanting to know if I'd blown up a real rabbit. I thought: ""What do you take me for?"" I'd be in jail if I'd done that! It's an incredibly convincing effect and I'm very proud of that. That is the point at which the people are either with the movie or they're not. Don't take it too seriously - we've got exploding rabbits in this film. How easy was it adjusting to a bigger budget of $30m? I loved it, the scale of it. It was exactly the same problems, just much bigger ones. From my point of view, you've got this much script to do with this much time and money - and that doesn't change. Bob Hoskins described you as an English Tarantino. How do you feel about that? Well I hope I don't talk as much. I think Tarantino's a phenomenal director and a very clever writer so I'll take that as a huge complement from Bob. The film opened in the US to mixed reviews. Do you read reviews and were you disappointed with the reaction? There's a lot of very positive reviews but the negative ones are really nasty and quite personal towards me. I think the Americans have had a harder time getting it than people have over here - a lot to do with the sense of humour, a lot do with the fact that it's set in the UK and has an all-British cast. That may have alienated the American audience a bit. I also thing it was marketed wrongly in the States and it should have been released after the UK. But all that's by the by. I think it's good for me to read those reviews. I was incredibly lucky with my first two films. To expect the same again would be daft so it's probably a good wake-up call for me. On your MySpace site you list Carry on Screaming as one of your favourite films. It's one of the greats. The first time I saw it I didn't know it was supposed to be a comedy. I was like five or six and it scared me rigid. Doomsday is out in UK cinemas on 9 May. Neil Marshall talked to BBC News website entertainment editor Tim Masters.     "
208,"Sheffield City Council has confirmed that The Wheel of Sheffield is leaving the city three months early.  The landmark attraction has been at the top of Fargate since July 2009.  More than 100,000 people went on it in the first six months and the council gave permission for it to stay until January 2011.  The council said was looking at plans to replace it with a Christmas attraction and details would be released in the coming weeks.  Councillor Roger Davidson said: ""We believe the Wheel of Sheffield has been a success in the city and a welcome addition to our skyline.  ""Its stay in Sheffield was always a temporary arrangement which has been extended beyond the original timescale of six months and we appreciate and accept its owner's decision to move it to a new location so it can be in place for Christmas.  ""We are currently looking at plans to replace it with a Christmas attraction once the site is vacated and will reveal further details in the coming weeks.  ""We'd like to thank Great City Attractions for choosing Sheffield as one of its recent UK sites.""  A spokesperson for Great City Attractions, Nigel Ward, said: ""The company had been delighted with the performance of the wheel during its extended stay in Sheffield and we wish to thank the people of Sheffield and the City Council for all their support.''"
209,"Nearly 150 people were injured, many seriously, by the double car bombing in the country's commercial capital, also known as Mumbai.  One explosion took place at the Gateway of India, the city's top tourist attraction.  The other explosion took place - and claimed most of the casualties - in a busy jewellery market near the Mumba Devi temple in central Bombay.  Witnesses described scenes of chaos as the blasts shook buildings, leaving mangled cars and trails of blood and glass strewn across the city's streets.  Telephone lines were jammed as panicked residents called family and friends.  No organisation has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, which took place during the lunchtime period and just five minutes apart.  Hours later, police found nine detonators in a railway tunnel north of Bombay.  The target appears to have been a train taking Hindus to a religious festival.  Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee strongly condemned the attacks, while the UN Secretary General called them despicable.  India's neighbour Pakistan said it deplored the incident.  The taxi containing that bomb had been parked outside the Taj Mahal Hotel, one of the city's oldest luxury hotels, where windows were shattered and cars damaged.  Witnesses said survivors ran for cover after the blast, which left trails of blood in front of the Gateway of India, a colonial arch built next to the sea and one of India's most famous landmarks.  Ambulances raced across the city and appeals went out for volunteers to make emergency blood donations.  There were scenes of even worse carnage at the city's Zaveri Bazaar gold market, where the bomb exploded in front of a multi-storied building containing shops on the ground floor and flats above.  ""You can't imagine what I saw. Bodies strewn around. I was in my flat when I heard a deafening sound. The building shook from its foundation, "" local resident Prashant Zaveri told the BBC.  ""I joined the neighbours. We put people inside cars, carts, whatever we could find and sent the injured to hospitals,"" he added.  BBC correspondent Zubair Ahmed says pieces of broken glass, blood stains and smashed cars and shops could be seen in a 100 metre (yards) radius from the spot where the blast took place.  ""There were legs and hands lying on top and inside my taxi,"" a local cab driver, whose clothes were covered in blood, told Reuters news agency. ""I had a miraculous escape.""  The Indian Government said it is not yet known who carried out the attacks, although it has been hinted that outlawed student Islamic groups could be involved.  Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani said that the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi), acting with the support of Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba, was to blame for a string of other attacks in Bombay in recent months.  ""Earlier these blasts were in buses and in almost all cases the organisation involved has been Simi and acting in conjunction with Lashkar e-Toiba,"" Mr Advani said.  Lashkar-e-Toiba is one of the two Pakistani rebel groups that Delhi blames for the December 2001 militant attack on its parliament which left 15 people dead, including five attackers.  Pakistan - India's traditional rival in the region and its neighbour - has condemned the bomb blast.  Police issued security alerts for Bombay and Delhi after the explosions, calling police officers back from leave in case of further trouble, AP reported.  The latest attacks coincided with the release of a report on the controversial religious site at Ayodhya.  The dispute has been blamed for previous explosions in Bombay.  In the early 1990s hundreds of people were killed in a series of bomb blasts which rocked the city.  Those attacks were seen as retaliation for Muslim deaths following Hindu-Muslim riots."
210,"Burma's most important dissidents have been released, in the latest of a series of prisoner amnesties.  Those freed include veterans of the 1988 student protest movement, monks involved in the 2007 demonstrations and ethnic-minority activists.  The highest profile is Min Ko Naing, a leader of the failed 1988 uprising.  State TV had announced that 651 prisoners would be freed under a new presidential pardon, but did not say how many would be political prisoners.  In a statement broadcast on the TV, President Thein Sein said those released were people who could ""play a constructive role in the political process"".  The atmosphere was buzzing. Hundreds of people had gathered outside the gates of Rangoon's main Insein prison. They waited for two hours, occasionally chanting ""welcome, welcome political prisoners"". Some brought white jasmine garlands to place around the necks of freed prisoners. It wasn't just families of political prisoners - hundreds of others were cheering. Among those freed were monks who participated in the 2007-2008 ""saffron revolution"". They had been disrobed and made to wear layman's clothes. There were student activists and members of Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party. Altogether, 82 prisoners were released from Insein. Other prominent student leaders are said to have been released from prisons in other districts and are on their way back to Rangoon. Prisoner releases had been expected, but the inclusion of such prominent figures meant this was still a surprise.  Responding to the release, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ""The release of all political prisoners is a long-standing demand of the international community and I warmly welcome these releases as a further demonstration of the Burmese government's commitment to reform.""  BBC South East Asia correspondent Rachel Harvey says the names of those released read like a who's who of Burma's most prominent political detainees.  Given their stature, this could be the most significant breakthrough yet in Burma's moves towards reform, she says.  But some Burmese exiles and campaign groups say the real test will be how much freedom the released prisoners will have to continue their activities, our correspondent adds.  Min Ko Naing was considered by many to be the highest-profile dissident still behind bars.  A crowd greeted him as he emerged from prison in Thayet, 545km (345 miles) north of Rangoon, the Associated Press news agency reported.  Another veteran member of Burma's 88 Generation Students, Nilar Thein, confirmed to the BBC that she had been freed from Tharya Wadi prison.  The activist served eight years in prison after the 1988 demonstrations and was jailed again in 2008 for 65 years for illegally using electronic media.  ""I'm healthy and happy to be released and happy to see my baby,"" she told the BBC, referring to her daughter, born the year before her imprisonment.  She said that although she had been released, 25 more political prisoners remained inside the prison.  Her husband, Kyaw Min Yu, known as Ko Jimmy, has also been freed, as well as Htay Kywe, a student activist jailed in 2007 for 65 years.  ""We have been trying all the time to have national reconciliation through political dialogue,"" Ko Jimmy told the BBC.  ""Since the new government accepts this concept, we can now work with them.""  Another student leader, Ko Ko Gyi, said he was excited about being released.  ""The rule of democracy is the buzz word in our country so they cannot U-turn, that's what I think,"" he told the BBC.  Former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt, who was detained in a purge in 2004, has been released from house arrest.  U Khun Tun Oo, the most senior political representative of the Shan, the largest of Burma's ethnic minorities, is also free.  Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi said the move was a ""positive sign"".  Five of those released were journalists from the exiled broadcaster Democratic Voice of Burma, based in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  One of them, Sithu Zeya, said he was wary of the conditions placed on his release.  ""I have been released with a rope around my neck,"" he said, saying that the charges against him had not been lifted and that he feared the government would not let him do his job.  The military-backed civilian government came to power in November 2010, after the country's first elections in 20 years. Before that Burma was governed by a military junta.  It has freed Ms Suu Kyi and begun dialogue with her and her The National League for Democracy (NLD). She is now expected to stand for parliament in a by-election in April.  Western nations have welcomed the reform process but called on the government to release political prisoners and resolve ethnic conflicts in border regions before sanctions can be eased.  No official tally of the number of political prisoners is available but prior to Friday's releases opposition groups estimated that up to 1,500 remained in custody.  The releases come a day after the government signed a landmark ceasefire with the rebel Karen National Union (KNU) in Hpa-an, capital of eastern Karen state.  The Karen have fought for greater autonomy for more than 60 years."
211,"Scene of pomp, ceremony and great controversy in 2000, Greenwich's Millennium Dome is back in use - as Crisis' main Christmas shelter for the homeless.  ""I name this the Dome Hotel,"" says John Cohen, 72, as he makes his way through the vast Dome.  ""It beats the Ritz, Claridges or the Dorchester. It's absolutely marvellous.""  This is John's 20th year at the homeless charity's London Christmas project.  He no longer sleeps rough, having found a flat 10 years ago, but still comes along ""to show my respect for those who looked after me"".  ""And,"" he says, ""because otherwise I'd be sat at home looking at four walls. I love to come here because of the wonderful warm welcome.""  Of six homeless shelters open across London from 23-30 December, the Dome is the main one.  And along one side of the huge structure, volunteers staff a comprehensive health centre - with dentists, opticians, podiatrists and dependency counsellors.  There are also housing advisers, TV rooms, a hairdresser and a clothing pick-up stall.  The Samaritans are on hand, waiting by a fence separating off the empty expanse that is the rest of the Dome's floor space.  Art workshops, musicians playing, drama, yoga and circus-skill teachers have all set up shop.  Everywhere there are volunteers, as Crisis' guests arrive.  Crisis found out the Dome was available to use less than a month ago and the set up took just five days. It replaces a more-compact warehouse used in previous years.  The charity's boss, Shaks Ghosh, breaks off from pointing one homeless lady in the direction of where she can get shoes, and says the place looks ""stunning"".  ""I hope for a lot of people it will be that moment when they think 'I am on my upward spiral',"" she says.  ""If you take people to a grungy warehouse, it doesn't give them the confidence or enthusiasm to start the rest of their life.  Up in the medical centre, Dr Justin Varney is keeping a watch on infection control - after, he says, some diarrhoea and vomiting last year.  A team of 30 doctors and 40 nurses will be checking patients, and encouraging them to keep any follow-up appointments.  The doctors' receptionists, he stresses, are friendly and welcoming.  ""If you think what it's like when you go along - and the receptionist says 'no'. You have enough power to fight your own corner.  ""But a homeless person might not have that - they might walk in and the reception they get makes them feel they should leave.""  It is the 'bread and butter"" basic dentistry that will keep Angela Honey, dentist, and Liz Deuchars, hygienist, occupied in their vans.  With two surgeries, they saw 200 people last year, and hope for more with three this time.  They say routine repairs help give patients back some confidence after missing hard-to-get-to check-ups.  Shuttle bus services from central London, and public transport to Greenwich, are getting people to what some feel is an out-of-the-way location for a shelter.  They can drop in to use the services for the day, eat at the Dome's cafe or stay at night in the sleeping area.  One 41-year-old rough sleeper, who did not wish to be named has just picked up a change of clothing from the ""excellent"" clothes stall.  But he is angry at not being let into the Dome until the afternoon and fed-up after a stint queuing outside in the cold. Homeless people need more permanent night shelters, he says, year round.  ""This seems to be a bit out of the way - it wasn't what I thought it would be.""  And he is dismissive of the medical services - ""When can you go back and see the doctor?"" he shrugs.  They are questions he heads off into the Dome to answer - before he decides whether to stay on or return to his pitch under Blackfriars Bridge in central London."
212,"The parents of the Tamil Tigers' dead leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, are in a camp for displaced people in the north of Sri Lanka, the army says. Thiruvenkadam Velupillai and his wife, Parvathi, both in their 70s, were found in the Menik Farm camp near the town of Vavuniya, the army said. ""They are safe and in good health,"" a spokesman, Brig Udaya Nanayakara, said. Family friends fear for the couple's safety, although they say they were not involved in the rebel struggle. Menik Farm, some 250km (155 miles) north of Colombo, is the biggest camp for those displaced by the war in Sri Lanka, housing about 200,000 people. Brig Nanayakara said the Prabhakarans were being provided with basic requirements like food and shelter. Although they [Prabhakaran's parents] were not involved in the armed struggle, neither were they at loggerheads with their son    ""At the same time we are not sure when they came over to government side. Like other internally displaced people they will be in the camp until they are resettled,"" he said. ""They will not be interrogated."" Friends of the Prabhakarans in the UK confirmed the couple had been traced. They say that the pair returned to Sri Lanka in 2003 after 10 years in self-imposed exile in the south of India. ""While the government has given assurances that they will not come to harm or be ill treated, we are nevertheless concerned about their safety at the hands of the army,"" a family acquaintance in London told the BBC News website. ""In the current tense climate anything could happen to them."" It is not clear how the rebel leader's parents ended up in the camp The army says that Velupillai Prabhakaran's son, Charles Anthony, was killed earlier this month in fighting in the north. There has been no firm reports as to the fate of the rebel leader's wife, daughter or other son. Mr Prabhakaran - who was killed around 18 May - is believed to have had three siblings. One brother is believed to be living in London and a sister lives in Canada. The whereabouts of a third sibling - if he or she exists - is unclear. Family friends in London say that Mr Prabhakaran's parents were not closely involved in the struggle for a Tamil state - called Eelam - and knew little of their son's activities after he took up arms. ""They are a highly principled couple who like many other Tamils are in shock and grieving over the recent bloodshed in Sri Lanka,"" the family acquaintance said. ""Although they were not involved in the armed struggle, neither were they at loggerheads with their son.""     "
213,"The 29-year-old, a World Cup winner four years ago, ended a 13-year career with Northampton in January because of a serious neck problem.  But surgeons have given Thompson the all clear to return to action and he hopes to be playing again in December.  He said: ""My body feels brilliant now. This offer gives me the chance to return and grow with Brive.""  It is a remarkable turnaround for Thompson, who was originally wanted as a scrum coach by Brive and had to seek clearance from the Rugby Football Union to adjust his contract.  He must also repay a substantial insurance claim awarded to him after a neck operation to replace a bulging disc - the problem that led to him retire.  Thompson's return to action may prompt speculation he could force his way back in to the England side and add to his 47 caps.  But Thompson insists his only goal is to get fit and play for his new club.  ""I was 'rugbyed' out when the injury happened. But now I realise how much I've missed the game,"" he told the Times.  ""I've looked at the players around the world at the top level and some are 34 or 35.  ""I'll get on an immersion course in France, slim down a bit and then we'll see where we go.  ""This is a chance to rediscover myself, take a new look at life."""
214,"The two singers are battling it out for the top spot with new singles which were both released on Monday.  Halliwell criticised record company executives for allegedly exploiting fans by encouraging the head-to-head race.  ""I think that we should be responsible about that because that little kid has to part with four quid and making them decide is really wicked, I think. That is like choosing between two parents,"" she said at the launch of her single Lift Me Up, at a record shop in central London.  Halliwell, 27, is hoping her third post-Spice Girls single will follow up her first solo number one Mi Chico Latino.  Industry figures leaked on Tuesday evening showed Halliwell was 600 sales ahead of Bunton - with a spokesman for the HMV retail chain saying: ""It's going to be one of the closest calls there has been in recent years.""  The former Ginger Spice took advantage of the recent wave of hip-gyrating Latin-mania which helped boost her second single to the top. Her debut solo single, Look At Me, went to number two.  Both singers have been making numerous TV promotional appearances.  Bunton has had plenty of exposure on music channel VH-1, where she has been a guest presenter this month, while Halliwell grabbed tabloid headlines for kissing singer Kylie Minogue on Channel 4 show TFI Friday.  The battle for top spot will be seen as a test of how Halliwell's career is progressing compared with her former colleagues.  Scary Spice Mel G was the first to go it alone with I Want You Back, but her follow-up Word Up reached only a disappointing 14.  Sporty Spice Mel C hit number four with her first effort Goin' Down.  A poll by the Dotmusic website this week found little between Look At Me and What I Am.  However, Halliwell - who left the group last year - nudged ahead as the more likely number one with 53% of votes compared with Bunton's 47%.  All will be revealed on 6 November when the new UK Top 40 is revealed."
215,"The Emmy award-winning show, which airs in the UK on BBC Two, will broadcast its final episode on 14 May after seven seasons on Fox.  The network announced last year it planned to drop cult comedy Arrested Development after a fall in viewers.  But producers 20th Century Fox TV said two other networks had put in bids to carry that series next year.  ""We are currently considering the offers on the table,"" said spokesman Chris Alexander.  The remaining episodes of Malcolm in the Middle will be shown on Sundays from 29 January at 7pm - a slot generally occupied by cartoon reruns.  Fox president Peter Liguori told reporters and critics at a gathering of North American TV critics in California that Malcolm in the Middle was leaving the network as an ""ageing"" sitcom.  Also getting the axe at Fox is comedy That 70s Show, now in its eighth series.  Fox is in conversations with former That '70s Show stars Ashton Kutcher and Topher Grace to return for the show's finale on 18 May.  ''We don't want to see these shows kind of crawl to their ending,'' Liguori said.  ''We'd much prefer to have them go out with a loyal audience and with some strengths, so that the shows have a fertile afterlife."""
216,"Lucky Igbinedion - who served as governor of Edo state - has been charged with 142 counts of corruption.  He was charged earlier this month, but is reported to have returned to the country by road from Sierra Leone.  Mr Igbinedion is the eighth ex-governor charged with graft since last year when President Umaru Yar'Adua came to power.  He is accused of stealing more than $24m (£12m) through three front companies.  Seven other governors have been charged with corruption by the EFCC.  The BBC's Ibrahim Dosara says the warrant shows EFCC chief, Nuhu Ribadu, is trying to bring people to book before he leaves office next month.  Mr Igbinedion left Nigeria shortly after the end of his tenure as governor in May last year. The EFCC alleges that Mr Igbinedion channelled money through companies registered to members of his family.  Mr Igbinedion was a key figure during the election of Mr Yar'Adua.  As the head of the Governor's Forum, he persuaded other state governors to withdraw from the party primaries in 2006 giving Mr Yar'Adua a clear run to the presidency."
217,"The deal will create the UK's dominant cable TV company, enabling it to compete more effectively with market leading pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB.  Analysts have been expecting a tie-up between NTL and Telewest for some time.  Both companies are recovering from a downturn, which saw NTL emerge from bankruptcy protection in 2003 and Telewest undergo restructuring.  Although NTL and Telewest's operations are focused in the UK, shares in both companies are traded in New York.  By the close of Monday's session, NTL has lost 1.2% to $65.97, while Telewest had added 1% to $23.17.  According to these figures, both companies have a market capitalisation of about $5.6bn.  The combined company will have TV, telephone and internet customers in about 5 million UK households, compared with BSkyB's 8 million subscribers.  The new group will also rival BT Group as Britain's second-largest residential telephone company.  The takeover will create ""a new competitive force in the communications and entertainment sectors in the UK"", said NTL chief executive Simon Duffy.  Mr Duffy will become chief executive of the combined group, while Telewest chief Barry Elson will step down once the merger has been completed.  ""We are very pleased to recommend this value-enhancing combination with NTL to our shareholders,"" said Telewest chairman Anthony Stenham.  NTL said it was too early to speculate how many jobs may be cut under the deal. The company employs about 10,000 people, while Telewest has 8,400 staff in the UK.  The takeover will see NTL take control of Telewest's key Flextech digital TV business, which includes UKTV, a joint venture with the BBC.  Telewest had put Flextech up for sale, and potential suitors included BSkyB and European broadcaster RTL.  NTL said it would pay $23.93 a share for Telewest, funding about two-thirds of the deal with cash. The company will also take on $3bn of Telewest debt.  ""Underpinned by a national strategy and increased scale and reach, this transaction positions the enlarged company for greater success than either company could have achieved alone,"" said NTL chairman James Mooney.  The UK's media landscape is consolidating, with a unified cable company squaring up against Freeview, commercial satellite operator BSkyB and soon Freesat, the free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV. Who do you think will win the race for audiences?  Surely, the method that delivers the lowest and cheapest common deminator. Isn't that the only valid standard in our present society?   W. Paton, Leeds  Sky already won ages ago. The next big deal comes when Britain's broadband services get fast enough (no thanks to BT in this reader's opinion) to cope with good enough quality video streaming from the internet.  Anon, UK  I have serious concerns over how NTL will manage the merger technically. They haven't really got to grips with the various smaller company areas with differing set-ups. In an effort to save money they have closed regional offices and amalgamated call centres with a resultant plummeting of customer service.  Paul Baxter, Huddersfield, UK  I have been an NTL customer for some years and am wondering what benefits this merger will have for NTL? Telewest have a better service for broadband and their customer support, I have been told, is pretty good too. Will NTL broadband customers get the 10Mb lines that Telewest are getting? Or will NTL customers be second class citizens in this new cable world?  Patrick Mortiboys, Farnborough, Hants  In my (limited) experience, Telewest is a much more reliable, customer focused, customer friendly company when you compare them to the mighty BT and BSkyB; I know who I'd prefer to use. Let's hope they retain that focus and show their rivals how it's done.  Charlie, Edinburgh  I still think sky but I hope all this competition will eventually bring down the prices and then maybe some day one of the companies will equal to Sky.   Denis Wilson, Belfast N Ireland  I've been a Telewest customer for many years and only hope that the quality of services doesn't deteriorate under NTL. Both can give BT a run for their money. As for BSkyB - well they're far too expensive and offer customers few options and poor value for money and no telephone service! I think the new boys on the block will beat them hands down!   Jean Statham, Linlithgow  This merger between NTL and Telewest has been mooted for years, and if it is value-enhancing now it just shows how shamefully slow this move has been for shareholders wiped out by the financial manoeuvrings of these two companies. Consumers, like shareholders, will learn that these cable services are simply too slow, and they are more likely to find the services they want, when they want them, elsewhere.  Steve Hitchcock, Bexley, UK  If a combined NTL/Telewest exploits fully its cable network; i.e. faster broadband speeds and a truly enhanced digital TV service with on demand capabilities, and if it strategically uses its content arm Flextech to compete and use as a bargaining tool against Sky then cable will inevitably win the battle. Cable companies have always suffered from bad management and mountainous debts ¿ if they can sort these issues out then there will be no stopping cable.  Jonathon Churchill, Swansea"

Or you can personally contact our Bollywood film specialist, Manish Gajjar, who maintains our Bollywood section at BBC Shropshire: manish.gajjar@bbc.co.uk  After being enthralled by super heroes like Superman, Batman, Spiderman and Harry Potter, it was high time that Indian films entered into the arena of science fiction and technical wizardry - and Krrish does just that! Taking off from where Koi Mil Gaya left off, Krrish opens with the late Rohit's son Krishna being taken care off by his grandmother, Rekha. Rekha soon realises that Krishna too has the super powers that an alien had passed onto her son Rohit. Fearing exploitation at the hands of the evil and selfish ones, she takes a super intelligent and powerful Krishna away from human civilization - somewhere unknown. Krishna grows up amongst the plants, trees animals, fishes and mountains but soon realises that his super powers also make him stand out among his friends, often alienating him. He yearns for a normal life, not one where he can fly and run faster than any bird or animal. At this point in time, enters Priya (Priyanka Chopra), an adventure tourist from Singapore. Krishna saves her life and falls in love with her. Priya leaves for Singapore, but using her false charms, lures Krishna for exploitation on a television show. But Krishna, who goes to Singapore, refuses to swallow the bait. Slowly, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Krishna, uses his powers to save people during a circus performance. He hides his true identity by using a a mask - the masked man becomes known as Krrish to the Singapore population. But thats not where this action packed film ends. Krrish discovers that his father has been destroyed by the evil, megalomaniac Dr. Arya (Naseerudin Shah), a scientist who wants to control human destiny. So the final forty minutes or so of the film revolve around the clash between evil and good. The film has excellent special effects, on par with the best from Hollywood. Of the cast, Hritik lives and breathes his role, displaying helplessness, anger, determination and romance with equal versatility.Here indeed, is an actor par excellence. Priyanka supports well while Rekha and Naseerudin are ever dependable. The music, except for the Dil Na Diya song, is mundane. The film, which is already proving to be one of the biggest money-spinners, not only in the UK cinemas but also around the world, is too good to miss."
219,"A Sky News report from Ukraine has drawn 110 complaints to Ofcom after a journalist rummaged through belongings at the scene of the MH17 plane crash.  Live footage broadcast at lunchtime on Sunday showed Sky's Colin Brazier pluck items from an open suitcase.  He dropped them back into the luggage saying ""we shouldn't really be doing this I suppose, really"".  A Sky News spokesperson said both Mr Brazier ""and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused"".  Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17.  All 298 people on board were killed.  The crash left bodies strewn across several kilometres, as well as plane wreckage and passengers' belongings.  Mr Brazier's broadcast showed an array of luggage and personal items, which he described as 'holiday paraphernalia', collected on the ground.  The media regulator Ofcom said it was assessing the complaints about the broadcast and had not yet decided if it would open an investigation.  A Sky News statement said that ""while presenting from the site of the MH17 air crash Colin Brazier reflected on the tragedy of the event and showed audiences the contents of one of the victim's bags.  ""Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on air. Both Colin and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused"".  The Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels have accused each other of shooting down the passenger jet.  Ukrainian authorities have released a recording they claimed was a conversation between pro-Russian militants admitting to shooting down the plane.  However, separatist leader Alexander Borodai accused the Ukrainian government of attacking the airliner itself.  The US and other nations say there is growing evidence of Russian complicity in the crash."
220,"An £88m scheme to improve safety on the motorway network around Bristol - and to make journey times more consistent - is now fully operational.  During busy times seven miles of the hard shoulder on the M4 and M5 can be opened to motorists and variable speed limits activated.  When lit, the mandatory speed limits will be enforced by speed cameras.  The project, which started in January 2012, was completed two months ahead of schedule and within its budget.  It is centred around the Almondsbury Interchange and covers junctions 19 to 20 on the M4 and 15 to 17 on the M5.  A Highways Agency spokeswoman said more than 2,000 people had worked on the project, with nearly half from the Bristol area.  Thirty-three new gantries have been installed, with seven refurbished, laying more than 30 miles of fibre optic cables and constructing six emergency refuge areas.  The ""smart motorway"" is managed from the HA's regional traffic control centre at Avonmouth.  From there, traffic officers monitor the motorway occupancy and during busy times can set overhead message signs informing drivers they can use the hard shoulder - and at what speed.  The managed section has blanket CCTV coverage and sensors in the road and refuge area alert agency traffic officers to any potential problems.  The roads minister, Robert Goodwill, is due to visit the control centre later on Wednesday and will officially hand over the project.  A review on the effectiveness of Bristol's M4/5 managed motorway is due to report back next January."
221,"The team were also fined a record $100m (£49.2m), which includes any prize and television money they would have earned from the constructors' championship.  But drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso can keep their points.  The team must also prove there is no Ferrari ""intellectual property"" in their cars next year before racing.  The decision means Ferrari, who go into this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix second in the constructors' championship, 57 points ahead of third-placed BMW Sauber, are almost certain to be crowned champions.  The row centres on McLaren being in possession of a confidential 780-page technical document belonging to Ferrari.  When he left the hearing, FIA president Max Mosley was asked if justice had been done, and replied ""Yes"".  A Ferrari statement said: ""In light of new evidence, facts and behaviour of an extremely serious nature and grossly prejudicial to the interest of the sport have been further demonstrated.  ""Ferrari is satisfied that the truth has now emerged.""  The World Motor Sport Council said it would publish the reasoning behind its verdict on Friday.  And McLaren team chief Ron Dennis said he would wait until then before deciding whether to appeal.  ""We believe we have grounds for appeal but of course we are going to wait for the findings of the FIA which are going to be published,"" Dennis explained.  ""The most important thing is that we go motor racing this weekend, the rest of the season and next season.""  Although he was clearly relieved that the team could continue racing, Dennis was understandably upset at what he saw as the besmirching of the team name.  ""Having been at the hearing I do not accept that we deserve to be penalised or our reputation damaged in this way,"" he said.  ""Today's evidence given to the FIA by our drivers, engineers and staff clearly demonstrated we did not use any leaked information to gain a competitive advantage.  ""The WMSC received statements from Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton and Pedro de la Rosa stating categorically no Ferrari information had been used by McLaren, and that no confidential data had been passed to the team.  ""The entire engineering team in excess of 140 people provided statements to the FIA affirming they had never received or used the Ferrari information.  ""We have never denied that the information from Ferrari was in the personal possession of one of our employees at his home.  ""The issue is: was this information used by McLaren? This is not the case and has not been proven.""  At the first hearing into the row, on 26 July, McLaren got off without punishment, but another hearing was convened after new evidence emerged, and that led to the points deduction and huge financial penalty.  Three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart believes there is more information to be made public.  ""All I can say, without being in full command of all of the information, is that the offence must be considerably larger than has been projected either by the governing body of the sport or within the media,"" he told BBC Radio 5live.  ""This isn't murder that has been carried out, this is something that has happened before and there wasn't even a fine or disciplinary action taken by the same governing body.  ""There is something very strange going on, there is no doubt about that.  ""From what information we have been given so far, this does not constitute a penalty of this scale with regards to the crime that has been carried out.  ""And even if they were found guilty of that particular crime, it doesn't justify this kind of penalty."""
222,"A cache of 500 original Beatles tapes stolen in the 1970s and containing tracks which have never before been released, has been recovered.  Police said the tapes were ""priceless"" and the only recordings from them which had ever been heard before were on bootlegs.  They were discovered in Holland when police cracked a piracy racket, arresting five people in raids in west London and the Netherlands.  The tapes are the only original recordings made and are thought likely to include material which has never been previously released.  They contain what is knows as the Get Back sessions.  An album of the same name was due to be released in 1969, but the project was abandoned and they became part of the Let It Be album instead.  The tapes disappeared shortly after the 1969 Get Back sessions, which saw the band returning to a back to basics approach to recording after the tensions of the 1968 ""White Album"".  The reels contain dozens of entire songs, as well as snippets of tracks which they attempted and then abandoned during the rehearsals.  A number of pirated versions of the tapes have been recovered in the UK, Mainland Europe and the USA, since they went missing more than 30 years ago.  Detective Inspector Paul Johnston of the City of London Police said: ""This is a good example of how an international multi-agency approach by both the private sector and police agencies can combat offences of this nature.""  Investigations were conducted by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which consulted the City of London Police, who identified a number of suspects.  A joint covert operation was mounted between the City of London Police's central detective unit and Dutch police.  On 10 January, City of London Police officers arrested two people in west London and another three were arrested in a town west of Amsterdam.  Prosecutor spokesman in Amsterdam, Robert Meulenbroek said: ""We're currently investigating whether they really are the originals, but it appears to be so.  ""There are about 500 tapes, so there's quite a bit to research.""  Speaking on News 24, City of London Police's director of intelligence Kieron Sharp said: ""The operation was conducted partly over in Holland and partly in this country.  ""But the tapes were stored over there and that's where they were recovered.""  The police investigation has taken a year to complete.  David Munns, vice chairman of EMI who sits on the IFPI board, said: ""Music piracy is a serious crime.  ""EMI will support all efforts to defend the intellectual property of our artists and of producers.""  IFPI chairman Jay Berman said: ""We applaud this exemplary police operation, which reflects the extraordinary level of international co-ordination that is needed to tackle the sophisticated cross-border strategies of today's organised music pirates.""  The tapes have been recovered along with other items believed to have been stolen from the recording company.  A number of search warrants have also been executed in the London area."
223,"He said that the politics surrounding such awards was ""demeaning"" and described the Oscar ceremony as ""a two-hour meat parade"".  On graduating from high school in 1945, he enlisted in the US Marines, where he spent four years burying bodies in Arlington National Cemetery and, as he later recalled, ""picking up a solid drinking habit that stayed with me from then on"".  Upon discharge from the Marines, he entered the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri and joined the university drama club.  Playing his first role in a production of The Winslow Boy his life was transformed. ""The minute I got on stage, I knew...that this was what I had to do.""  Dropping out of college to pursue a career on the stage, George C Scott spent a number of lean years in Hollywood and Broadway before playing the title role in Joseph Papp's production of Richard III. He was rarely out of work after that.  In 1959, he appeared in his first film, a psychological Western, The Hanging Tree. The same year, Otto Preminger cast him as the relentless prosecuting attorney in Anatomy of a Murder. The role brought him his first, unsuccesful, Oscar nomination.  Memorable in The Hustler in 1961, the following year saw him as the bomb-loving US General Buck Turgidson in Doctor Strangelove. The film, a satire on the Cold War, starring Peter Sellars delighted and provoked audiences around the world.  He brought characteristic gravitas to the role of Abraham in the 1966 production of The Bible before taking the lead role in Patton for which he will probably be best remembered.  His ability to dominate the screen was essential in such films. He played Patton as a larger than life character, sometimes out of control, at other times coolly calculating.  More recently, George C Scott returned to Broadway in Inherit the Wind with Jack Lemmon and was still to be seen in innumerable cameo roles both on TV and film.  He was uneasy with stardom, once admitting: ""There is no question you get pumped up by the recognition. Then a self-loathing sets in when you realise you're enjoying it.""  George C Scott was a complex man whose reputation as a hellraiser belied the range of his ability. In an age of tightly marketed, yet limited, Hollywood superstars, his status as one of the finest ever American actors is assured."
224,"Despite losing territory in the east earlier this year, the rebels still control a vast swathe of land in the north of the island.  Although sporadic fighting has been going on for months, the intensity of the clashes has recently increased.  Fighting is currently taking place around Mannar, Vavuniya, Weli Oya and Jaffna - all areas which surround rebel-held territory. There are intermittent battles at sea as well.  ""Sri Lankan forces are now focusing on the nerve centre of the rebels. Since their rear base is under threat, the Tigers have to break out militarily at some point,"" says analyst DBS Jeyaraj.  The pattern is clear. Both sides exchange heavy artillery fire in the Forward Defence Lines (FDLs), separating their forces. Heavy aerial bombardment is followed by military incursions.  The government claims that at least 280 rebels have been killed since September and more than 20 soldiers have been killed in various battles over the same period.  But the claims of both sides in relation to casualties and what exactly has happened on the battle front can rarely, if ever, be independently confirmed.  For its part, the government has denied starting any offensives.  ""Government forces are only defending their positions and if they are attacked they will counter-attack,"" Sri Lankan army spokesperson Brig Udaya Nanayakkara told the BBC.  Earlier attempts by the military to capture the rebel stronghold in Vanni have ended in disaster. But buoyed by recent victories in the east, the army is now confident of recapturing territory in the north as well.  Tamil rebels are also gearing up for a major battle. There are already reports of the rebels establishing a three-layered defensive infrastructure inside Vanni region. Troops are likely to suffer casualties while trying to penetrate these heavily fortified defence lines.  But the Sri Lankan military claims to have had several morale-boosting successes in recent weeks. They claim that many rebel ships carrying arms have been destroyed recently in the open sea.  The military says that it has also moved into certain strategic areas in Mannar district. There is little doubt that their confidence is high.  Perhaps the main concern is the fate of thousands of civilians trapped inside rebel-held areas and border regions. Local journalists say that more than 200 civilians have been killed in various incidents since the beginning of August. If full-scale conflict erupts, then civilians will be forced to flee.  There are already more than 5,000 civilians displaced in the recent fighting in the north.  ""We were forced to leave our homes due to heavy shelling. We have been moving from place to place. Life in the refugee camps is miserable,"" says a displaced Tamil who did not want to be identified.  Some of the displaced civilians in the north are afraid that they may not be allowed to go back to their homes even if the fighting ends. They point out that while major clashes ceased in the east some months ago, more than 40,000 civilians are still scattered in various camps for displaced people.  The upsurge in fighting has happened despite the Norwegian-brokered ceasefire agreement, signed in 2002. Everyone recognises that it now exists only on paper.  The political process is also in limbo. The government had announced the formation of an all-party group last year to discuss a political solution to the war. The final draft of the proposals is still under discussion and the delay is worrying the Tamils.  ""The government seems to be emboldened by their recent military success in the east. So, they think there is no need to devolve power to the Tamils,"" says Mr Jeyaraj.  Meanwhile, the government is also coming under intense scrutiny from human rights agencies, who accuse the security forces and paramilitary groups of abductions and killings. Officials vehemently deny these charges. Tamil rebels also face similar accusations from human rights groups. But they, too, deny the accusations.  United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour spoke out strongly this month against the country's human rights record.  ""The most serious human rights issue is the lack of credible public information on the large number of unresolved cases of abductions, disappearances and killings... These cases are not properly recorded, investigated and there is no prosecution,"" Ms Arbour told the BBC's Newshour programme after her recent visit to the island-nation.  The international community's plea to both warring parties to refrain from all-out war does not appear to be having any effect.  The forthcoming monsoon may delay an imminent major confrontation but analysts say Sri Lanka is on course for a protracted and a bitter conflict in the coming months.  In the meantime, displaced civilians are afraid that the lack of international attention to their plight will only add to their misery."
225,"Top of the Pops (TOTP) launched itself as a hip and happening music show giving the tuned in generation the music of the moment.  Originally commissioned for just six episodes of live music in 1964, the show has just gone on and on - witnessing some of the weird and wonderful moments from pop's history.  It is a rite of passage to cringe with embarrassment as your mum and dad mutter: ""That's not music it's just noise.""  The first show, in its original Wednesday night slot, opened with DJ Jimmy Savile introducing the Rolling Stones, whose single I Wanna Be Your Man was sitting at number 13 in the charts.  Some of the biggest names in the music business have appeared on the show playing their number one hits, such as Madonna, Michael Jackson and Kylie Minogue.  Although TOTP has undergone numerous face-lifts in its 37-year history it has always featured the famous chart rundown, culminating in the number one single of the week.  The big difference between then and now is that if an artist cannot appear on the show to showcase their latest release, the producers have the option of playing their video - usually an expensive, glossy affair.  But it was so different in the early days, before MTV made videos an essential for every act.  To fill the gaps, they came up with the bright idea of using a troupe of dancing girls to act out an elaborate routine to the hit single.  Although the Go-Jos were the first group of dancers, it was Pan's People, masterminded by Flick Colby, who captured the imaginations of girls who wanted to be like them and boys and men who were just ""appreciating the music"".  Pan's People, who made their debut on the show in 1968 dancing to Tommy James And The Shondells' hit Mony Mony, stayed with the show for a decade.  They were briefly replaced by Ruby Flipper before morphing into Legs & Co and despite a more politically-correct group called Zoo, featuring men and women, the rise in music videos saw the iconic dancing groups shimmer off the stage for the last time in the early 1980s.  The presenters have always been a major part of the show, and at first four DJs were used - Savile, Alan Freeman, Pete Murray and David Jacobs - to front the weekly live broadcasts from Manchester.  In 1967 the show moved to London's Lime Grove studios and gained some recruits from the newly formed BBC Radio 1, including Stuart Henry, Kenny Everett, Simon Dee and Emperor Roscoe.  The station's DJs continued to front the show through the 70s and 80s, but the 90s revamp paved the way for a string of celebrity hosts, with Kylie Minogue and the Spice Girls among those who got to present as well as perform.  TOTP's current format, launched on 1 May 1998, featured a new version of its most famous theme tune, Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love (Phil Lynott's Yellow Pearl and Paul Hardcastle's The Wizard have been used in the past).  The brand has extended to TOTP2, screened twice weekly on BBC Two.  The show, narrated by Steve Wright, features archive clips of classic TOTP performances and allows those who grew up with Top Of The Pops to relive some of their favourite moments.  Under current producer Chris Cowey, the format remains familiar, and still attracts some of the biggest names in pop - Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez are just two of the superstar singers who have popped up in the past year.  ""When I was asked if I wanted to do TOTP, it took me maybe ten seconds to say yes,"" Cowey said.  ""It's the holy grail of music television."""
226,"According to papers found by Dutch journalists, KLM asked Switzerland to let Germans cross its borders and fly to South America without proper papers.  Suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving Germany by the Allies.  KLM acknowledges some of its passengers may have been fleeing justice, but denies it sought to help them escape.  A spokesman for the airline, Bart Koster, told the BBC that it was not responsible for carrying out background checks on passengers who had been allowed to leave by the Allies.  Dutch MPs, historians and Jewish groups have demanded an independent investigation into the reports first aired last week, particularly because a member of the Dutch royal family may have been involved.  Prince Bernhard, the father of Queen Beatrix, was the director of KLM at the time.  Mr Koster said KLM did not want to run away from the allegations and was willing to co-operate with any inquiry.  ""We would welcome everything which could help clarify what may have happened,"" he said.  According to documents found in Switzerland by Dutch TV documentary-makers, a local representative for KLM, Mr Frick, asked the Swiss border police in 1948 to allow his airline's passengers from Germany to enter the country without the proper papers so they could fly to Argentina.  Sander Rietveld from the Netwerk programme said that although the memo from the border police about Mr Frick's visit showed his request had been refused, many Germans were allowed to enter Switzerland without permission.  ""The point is that it shows KLM actively approached the Swiss police,"" he told The Times.  Marc Dierikx, an aviation historian at the Institute for Netherlands History, said other documents showed that many Germans had paid large sums of money to leave the country and that KLM was ""intensively involved"".  Mr Koster said KLM had no record of a former employee called Mr Frick in its archives, nor evidence that its board had known anything about the allegations.  ""We have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved,"" he said.  ""However, it cannot be excluded that KLM representatives were not involved at a local level.""  Experts say more research is needed in Europe and Argentina, because no passenger lists for KLM flights have been kept.  Argentina was notorious for welcoming war criminals into the country when President Juan Peron was in power between 1945 and 1955.  More than 150 Nazis were given refuge - among them Adolf Eichmann, who is considered to have been the chief architect of the Holocaust."
227,"The offending lines are ""I don't want to see a ghost/It's the sight that I fear most/I'd rather have a piece of toast/Watch the evening news"".  Listeners to Marc Riley's BBC6 Music show have been voting for the past three weeks on a top 10 list of shame.  Second place went to Snap's Rhythm is a Dancer which goes ""I'm as serious as cancer/ When I say rhythm is a dancer"".  In third place was ""And I met a girl/ She asked me my name/ I told her what it was"" from Razorlight's 2005 hit Somewhere Else.  Other songs to make the top 10 are U2's Elevation (Been living like a mole now/ Going down, excavation), Champagne Supernova by Oasis (Slowly walking down the hall/ Faster than a cannonball) and Black Sabbath's War Pigs (Generals gathered in their masses/ Just like witches at black masses).  Riley said: ""Bad lyrics can come in all forms - some acceptable, some less so.  ""For instance, in the right hands, defiantly dumb lyrics such as Manfred Mann's Do Wah Diddy Diddy (diddy dum diddy do) can be more than acceptable as part of the pop idiom.  ""In fact we embrace them. Let's not forget it was a number one smash.  ""But imagine the same words streaming from the crown prince of gloom Leonard Cohen, accompanied only by a forlorn expression and a battered banjo.  ""It would (quite rightly) be mocked and held up for much ridicule.""  He added: ""In short, dumb is sometimes OK, whereas pious and pretentious and pompous are obviously never to be encouraged nor tolerated."""
228,"The police can keep DNA samples and fingerprints from people charged with a crime but never convicted, the Court of Appeal has ruled.  One of the three judges agreed that keeping data taken from unconvicted people did breach their right to respect for private life under the European Convention on Human Rights.  But they all said it was a ""relatively minor invasion"" of privacy, and justified by the legitimate aim of preventing crime.  The appeal had been brought on behalf of two people who were charged with a crime, but never convicted.  One was a 12-year-old boy arrested for attempted robbery but acquitted, and the other a man arrested on harassment charges which were dropped when his partner became reconciled with him.  The two had claimed the storing of their genetic fingerprints breached their right to respect for private life, as protected by the Convention.  The court ruling came on the same day that the inventor of DNA fingerprinting, Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, said he now believed it was wrong that genetic fingerprints of people cleared of a crime were stored by police.  Sir Alec said the practice was highly discriminatory, and said a national database of everyone's DNA should be established so particular individuals or groups were not targeted.  Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf, sitting with Lord Justice Waller and Lord Justice Sedley, said: ""The larger the databank of fingerprints and DNA samples... the greater the value of the databank will be in preventing crime and detecting those responsible for crime.""  He added that if everyone was required to provide the information it would make a ""dramatic contribution"" to the detection of crime, but Parliament had not allowed this blanket approach.  Lord Justice Sedley suggested that Chief Constables should consider whether or not to retain samples in each individual case, rather than operate blanket policies - but this was not a requirement.  Permission to take the case to the House of Lords was refused, but the lawyers who brought the case later said they would appeal directly to the House.  Peter Mahy, a solicitor with Sheffield-based Howells, said it was clear the judges recognised the unease ""innocent people feel"" about the practice of retaining samples, so there was ""every reason"" to continue the fight.  He said in a statement: ""This is a fundamental human rights issue... and, if necessary, we will see it through to the European Court of Human Rights.""  Human rights campaign group Liberty said the judges' ruling was ""disappointing"", and the practice of retaining unconvicted suspects' DNA was ""arbitrary and unfair"".  It said DNA samples and fingerprints should only be kept for convicted offenders.  More than 1.7m DNA profiles are now held on the database, and the target is to have about three million profiles stored by April 2004.  Home Office figures show that every week around 1,600 DNA matches are made either connecting a suspect to a crime scene or linking crime scenes together."
229,"North Cornwall, where two surfers drowned in a tragic accident, boasts some of Europe's finest surfing beaches with Newquay the surfing capital.  The surf beach culture with its own fashion, music and language brings thousands of visitors each year and is a vital part of the local economy.  There are even proposals for a ""surf reef"" off one of the main Newquay beaches to create good consistent surfing conditions all the year round.  Yet, as shown by the deaths of a father and son while bodyboarding, the sport is high-risk. Four million people visit Cornwall every year and research has shown that a quarter will take part in some sort of watersport. Newquay's tourism office describes the town as a family resort which also attracts large numbers of young people who flock to the area for the surfing.  ""We are world-renowned for our surfing,"" said Sylvia Hodgson, assistant marketing and promotions manager for Newquay and the Cornish Riviera. ""It is important to the local economy as we have the serious surfers and the holidaymakers who like to try things like bodyboarding."" The recent Rip Curl championships attracted competitors from around the world and Europe's number one surfer Russell Winter is from Newquay. The town has many surf and board shops and there is a spin-off social scene in sports bars and pubs frequented by surf ""dudes"". Research is going on into whether a ""surf reef"" can be built off one of Newquay's main surfing beaches. ""There is a bid in for European funding,"" said Teresa Timms, Cornwall Tourism spokeswoman. The two men who died on Thursday were caught in a rip tide at Holywell Bay.  These are powerful channels of water moving back out to sea after being pushed towards the shore by waves. Because they lurk in seemingly calm waters, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers can easily be swept away. They are characterised by darker and foamier water, sometimes with floating debris. The rip area is usually calm with a rippled surface and smaller waves. The currents often look like small rivers flowing away from shore. Rip currents exist in areas where the strength of the waves is weakened by objects such as sand bars, piers and even large groups of bathers. The UK Surf Lifesavers Association says rip tides are the biggest cause of rescues. Rip currents occur on many Cornish beaches although coastguards say the number of incidents has been down this year. The deaths of the two bodyboarders were the first drowning fatalities in Newquay this summer. Lifeguards say swimmers caught in a rip tide should stay calm and not swim directly against it. Strong swimmers should swim parallel to the shore until they pass the current and only then swim toward the beach. Weak or inexperienced swimmers should ride it out and then swim parallel to the shore for 30 to 40 metres to where the waves are breaking before turning to swim straight to the beach."

231,"Celtic fought back from a three-goal deficit to snatch a share of the points in a dramatic match at Rugby Park.  First-half goals from Dean Shiels, Paul Heffernan and James Fowler had given the home side an emphatic half-time lead.  But Celtic fought back through two goals within three minutes from Anthony Stokes and a Charlie Mulgrew header with 10 minutes remaining.  Heffernan squandered a late chance for Kilmarnock to steal the points.  Neil Lennon had spoken of the need to make personnel changes after their loss to Hearts and dropped Badr El-Kaddouri, Victor Wanyama and Mohamed Bangura, with Cha Du-ri, Joe Ledley, Beram Kayal and Anthony Stokes coming in.  The home side also made four changes, with goalkeeper Cammy Bell not included in the squad because of an elbow injury and replaced with Anssi Jaakkola.  It was the home side who started more brightly, Celtic struggling to break down their impressive passing display.  But it was the visitors who had the first real chance of the match in the 12th minute.  James Forrest delivered the ball to Cha, who picked out the Irishman at the back post, Stokes unable to make any meaningful contact with the ball from just a yard out and sending the ball over the crossbar.  Kilmarnock continued to look the livelier side and their effort was rewarded in the 26th minute, Shiels' goal coming with the first shot on target by either side.  Right-back Alex Pursehouse sent an ambitious long ball that located Heffernan on the left wing, and his chip found the run of Shiels, who took a deft touch before driving the ball diagonally across goal and past Fraser Forster in the Celtic net from 12 yards out.  With Celtic clearly rattled, Kilmarnock continued to dominate, Liam Kelly almost increasing the lead in the 37th minute with a long-range shot from 40 yards out that forced Forster to tip the ball over the bar.  Paul Heffernan extended their lead just two minutes later, with Shiels the creator.  The Kilmarnock manager's son burst into space to evade Cha before slotting the ball through to Heffernan, who looked a touch offside as he drove home from inside the box.  Celtic then appeared to self-destruct as they lost a third goal. Mulgrew was at fault with a hapless pass-back to Forster that was pounced on by Fowler, who lobbed the ball over the goalkeeper.  That scoreline meant changes for Celtic in the second half, with Gary Hooper and Beram Kayal replaced by Wanyama and Bangura.  Their resurgence was signalled 10 minutes after the restart, with Forrest waltzing through the Kilmarnock defence. He was eventually dispossessed by Kelly, Pursehouse blocking a second attempt on goal.  With 69 minutes on the clock, Forrest again attempted to set up Stokes at the back post, the striker unable to match the pace of the ball and sending it behind for a goal kick.  However, he was given the opportunity to make amends when Kilmarnock conceded a free-kick 26 yards from goal, delivering a superb strike that gave Jaakola no chance.  Within three minutes, the game was reignited when Stokes grabbed a second. A right-footed strike from 22 yards out evaded the Kilmarnock keeper, who perhaps should have done better.  Kilmarnock's undoing was completed when Mulgrew headed home from close range with 10 minutes remaining to complete an incredible comeback that saw three goals in seven minutes.  The Rugby Park side had the chance to snatch victory when Heffernan contrived to head over the crossbar from four yards out with two minutes remaining of regulation time.

232,"A few months into World War Two, in April 1940, Adolf Hitler made a huge strategic gamble. He and his strategists knew that Norwegian coastal waters were vital for the transport of Swedish iron ore via Narvik to German blast furnaces. And, more generally, recognised that German control of Norwegian waters would make breaking the Allied blockade of Germany a little easier. Germany had also seen the signs that the British would not necessarily be bound by Norway's neutrality, and could hinder the process if they were so minded. The British position was made fairly clear when Royal Navy seamen boarded the German naval auxiliary Altmark, in Norwegian waters, to free the prisoners on board, and the Allies had indeed for some time been making plans for aggressive action to plug the gap in their blockade. Germany's navy was greatly inferior to the Royal Navy in all categories ... Hitler's plans in the face of this situation were decisive. The idea was that the whole strength of the German navy was to land powerful forces all the way along the Norwegian coast, from Oslo to Narvik, to protect the coastal waterways along which the iron ore was transported. This was risky in the extreme. Germany's navy was greatly inferior to the Royal Navy in all categories, and even if the troops succeeded in getting ashore, helped by the element of surprise, it was quite possible for them to be cut off subsequently. Only one thing might prevent disaster - German air power, in the shape of Fiegerkorps X. This unit contained about 400 bombers, whose crews had been specially trained in maritime operations, and it was hoped that these could keep the British at bay.  By April the British had changed their plan, and reduced it to a relatively less complex mining operation. Then, as luck would have it, both the British and German operations went ahead at almost the same time. British mine-laying began early on 8 April, but was disrupted by news of major German fleet movements. The Admiralty, on its own initiative, decided that all strength should be diverted to dealing with the German fleet at sea, and troops already aboard British cruisers and intended for the likely landings were disembarked. Hitler's troops landed on Norwegian soil the following day. The German operation was generally successful, but did not go entirely according to plan. The German operation was generally successful, but did not go entirely according to plan. At Oslo the brand new heavy cruiser Blucher was sunk by Norwegian coast defences in Oslo Fiord. This delayed the occupation of the capital, and allowed the members of the Norwegian government and royal family to escape.  Blucher's sister ship, Hipper, was also damaged when she was rammed by the British destroyer Glowworm, but she was still able to help take the city of Trondheim. The light cruiser Karlsruhe led the assault on Kristiansand, but was sunk later that same day by the British submarine Truant. Her sister ship, Konigsberg, was damaged by Norwegian shore batteries at Bergen, and was finished off by British Skua naval dive bombers flying from the Orkneys the next day. She was the first major warship ever to be sunk by aircraft. ... German destroyers were able to get their troops ashore, sinking two Norwegian coast defence vessels in the process. In the far north, at Narvik, the ten most modern German destroyers were able to get their troops ashore, sinking two Norwegian coast defence vessels in the process. The senior British officer in the area was WJ Whitworth, Vice Admiral of the Battlecruiser Squadron in HMS Renown. He had fought a fleeting engagement with the German fast battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau early on the 9th but the Germans, after being hit several times, had used superior speed to get away. Unfortunately the Admiralty did not give Whitworth the opportunity to mount a powerful counter attack on the Germans at Narvik, and only a single destroyer flotilla was ordered in by London on 10 April. This consisted of Captain BAW Warburton-Lee's five 'H' class vessels.  These sank two of the German destroyers in Narvik harbour and damaged three others, but were engaged by the remaining five German ships. The British flotilla leader Hardy was sunk (Warburton-Lee was awarded the first Victoria Cross of World War Two) as was HMS Hunter. Whitworth led in a more powerful force in the battleship Warspite three days later. She and the nine accompanying destroyers annihilated the rest of the German flotilla. Whitworth had this kind of freedom of action because German air power had still not reached so far north. Less happy was Admiral Sir Charles Forbes, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, who first encountered Fliegerkorps X on the afternoon of 9 May, off southern Norway. Although during this attack only one ship, the destroyer Gurkha, was sunk, Forbes thought that the danger was such that he could not operate his surface forces in these waters. His carrier Furious had no fighters, and the anti-aircraft guns of the fleet provided insufficient protection, contrary to what pre-war thinking had led him to expect. The troops had to be evacuated, with two Allied destroyers, one British and one French ... The main Allied counter-attack came at Trondheim, with a two-pronged attack from Namsos in the north and Andalsnes in the south. But reinforced by Stuka dive bombers, Fliegerkorps X dominated the region, supporting the better equipped German ground forces in defeating the Allies. The deployment of fighters from the carriers Glorious and Ark Royal, as well as RAF Gladiator fighters from a frozen lake, could do little to help. The troops had to be evacuated, with two Allied destroyers, one British and one French, being sunk off Namsos and a British sloop at Andalsnes. It was still hoped that northern Norway might be held, to deny the Germans their iron ore. Narvik was occupied by a mixed force of mountain troops, reinforced by the crews of the destroyers that had landed them, and a parachute battalion dropped in from the air. An Allied force of British, French, Norwegian and Polish troops was built up, and land-based air cover was provided by a squadron of Gladiators and one of Hurricanes, flown from carriers.  After delays caused by divided counsels, Narvik was finally taken on 28 May, but the decision to evacuate it had by that time been made. The German victories of that month in France and the Low Countries had transformed the strategic situation, and had left the Allies with little alternative. In any case, the withdrawing Germans had done a comprehensive job of destroying the iron ore facilities. The evacuation was marred by the loss of the British aircraft carrier Glorious which, with an escort of two destroyers, was returning ahead of the rest of the fleet carrying evacuated Hurricane fighters. The carrier was caught by Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and sunk with gunfire, although Scharnhorst was torpedoed and seriously damaged by the escorting destroyer Acasta. ... by the end of the campaign the German navy had only three cruisers and four destroyers operational. Shortly afterwards Gneisenau was also torpedoed by the submarine Clyde, and by the end of the campaign the German navy had only three cruisers and four destroyers operational. This was not a force that could contest the command of the Channel to cover a cross-Channel invasion, and in this way the Norwegian campaign probably helped save Britain. Although Germany succeeded in pushing back the British blockade line, it never found Norway to be the asset it had hoped for. And although the territory later provided a base from which to attack Allied Arctic convoys to the USSR, Norway's defence tied down more forces than the country's strategic usefulness merited.  Norway was, however, also a major strategic failure for the British. This was a campaign that should have played to British strengths. Instead it brought out one of the major weaknesses of the contemporary Royal Navy - its incapacity to contest command of the air off a distant shore, due to its lack of radar control and high performance fighters. In addition to the other losses, the cruiser Effingham was wrecked and the anti-aircraft cruiser Curlew bombed and sunk near Narvik, while a French cruiser was seriously damaged. A total of seven British destroyers was lost, plus one French and one Polish. Given Allied superiority in numbers these losses were not too serious, but the sense of failure was real. A total of seven British destroyers was lost, plus one French and one Polish. Even before the campaign was over, it was perceived to have gone so badly that there was a vote of no confidence in the British Parliament. The government suffered a reduced majority, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned. The main architect of the Norway campaign, the British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, who had been responsible for many of the mistakes of the campaign, was the main beneficiary of these political events. He was the favoured candidate to take over as prime minister, and thus became Britain's war leader. Such are the ironies of history."
233,"Child abuse linked to exorcism and witchcraft accusations is on the rise, figures obtained by the BBC suggest.  The Metropolitan Police said there had been 60 crimes linked to faith in London so far this year. It saw reports double from 23 in 2013 to 46 in 2014.  Half of UK police forces do not record such cases and many local authorities are also unable to provide figures.  The NSPCC said authorities ""need to ensure they are able to spot the signs of this particular brand of abuse"".  London is unique in having a police team, Project Violet, dedicated to this type of abuse.  Its figures relate to crime reports where officers have flagged a case as involving abuse linked to faith or belief. Many of the cases involve children.  Ibidapo was trafficked to the UK from Nigeria in 2007, to work as a servant for relatives in the North of England. They accused her of being a witch, stopped her going to school and physically assaulted her. She escaped with the help of a Nigerian woman living nearby.  ""I started living with my aunty at the age of 10, to help her to look after the baby. If my aunty went to work I'd be left with the baby, to do all the housework, wash clothes, cook the food.  ""Each time the children got sick my aunty would accuse me of being the one responsible for their illness, start calling me a witch, start beating me up, and there was a time that she took me down to church, to a pastor. They were calling me a witch, they were using a broom to beat me.  ""Sometimes my aunty would look into my eyes and call me a witch. It made me feel rejected, like I'm nobody.""  Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information (FoI) request reveal that half of UK police forces do not routinely record cases.  Only two forces other than the Met have reported incidents over the last three years: Greater Manchester and Northamptonshire each had one case.  A separate FoI request to local councils across the UK revealed 31 cases where a child had been accused of witchcraft or possession by spirits in 2014 - 30 in England and one in Wales.  This compares with 21 cases in 2013 and 10 in 2012. However 88 councils, 40% of those that responded, were unable to provide figures.  This is despite a 2006 recommendation in a government-commissioned report that cases of child abuse linked to accusations of ""possession"" and ""witchcraft"" should be recorded centrally.  Terry Sharpe, from the Project Violet team, said cases remained small in number, but there had been a significant increase, covering a spectrum of seriousness.  ""You'll get the actual physical abuse and injuries taking place, and, in the worst-case scenario, we've had some homicides as well,"" he said.  ""We've had a case within the last year where a nine-year-old boy had been called a devil child and thrown out of his address by his parents and was found by social services standing in his bare feet.""  In another case a child was attacked by his mother, who bit him on the face and tried to smother him, because she believed he was a ""witch possessed by evil spirits"".  Debbie Ariyo, founder of Africans Unite Against Child Abuse, said accusations were often made when families experienced problems: ""Children are blamed - especially stepchildren.""  She added that within churches there was often a financial motivation behind accusations.  ""The pastor says there's a witch in this church today; looks around and points to a child.  ""That means public humiliation for the family. The next step is exorcism which is not done for free. It's a money-making scam.""  She warned against viewing the issue as solely affecting the African community, as her organisation has supported victims from other faiths and cultural backgrounds, including the South Asian community.  She is concerned about the lack of awareness among childcare professionals in the UK.  ""We did a training event in July for social workers, teachers, and lawyers. Most of them didn't know anything about witchcraft and juju but they had dealt with [such] cases,"" Ms Ariyo said.  ""It is very important to know the background, so that if a child comes to school on Monday and says 'the pastor called me a witch', they treat it as a safeguarding issue and don't dismiss it.""  An NSPCC spokesman said: ""While the number of child abuse cases involving witchcraft is relatively small, they often include horrifying levels of cruelty.  ""The authorities which deal with these dreadful crimes need to ensure they are able to spot the signs of this particular brand of abuse and take action to protect children before a tragedy occurs.""  The government said its statutory guidance made it clear that anyone who had concerns about a child's welfare ""should report this to children's social care or the police.  5 Live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday 11 October.

234,"As people in South Korea debate the merits of eating dog meat ahead of the football World Cup, dog restaurants in Vietnam are doing well.  Dog is a popular dish in the country, where it is eaten for its protein and also for good luck.  It is particularly popular in the urban areas of the north where increasing incomes have sparked a search for new and more exotic recipes.  At a busy restaurant in Hanoi, a woman weighs and chops up small puppies for her customers.  There are about seven dishes featuring dog meat, and they often include the head, feet and internal organs.  Dog meat has a strong smell and taste. It is heavily spiced and usually served with alcohol.  Diners are mostly men - they believe it will make them more virile. But eating dog is reserved for the second half of the lunar month. Dog meat sellers do good business then, with many customers who believe they will dispel their misfortunes by eating the meat.  The dogs are small with long bodies and short legs, best eaten at about a year old. They come from puppy farms or are collected from the countryside.  It is common to see them in the streets of the capital, crammed into wire cages or cooked and skinned on the backs of motorbikes. They are killed with a blow, boiled to remove the fur and roasted.  People who keep dogs as pets are very cautious of their safety, and if a dog is seen on the street, it is usually an exotic breed being watched by one of the family.  Many people are comfortable with the idea of loving their pet and following what they see as the natural order of eating chicken, pork or dog meat.  While eating dog is permitted, eating cats has been made illegal in an effort to reduce the number of rats and mice.  Cats are usually kept tied up or in cages, partly so that their miaows frighten the rodents and partly, as many believe, to protect them from being stolen for illicit cat restaurants."
235,"It was back in 1807 that Portadown District Orange Lodge started going to services at Drumcree parish church, perched on a tranqil country hillside on outskirts of the County Armagh market town.  However it has only been over the past eight years that the Orangemen's annual Battle of the Somme commemoration service has been making headlines in newspapers and on television screens around the world.  During this time, Drumcree has become synonymous with violent protest and angry confrontation.  There is a history of clashes between Catholics and Protestants in the area arising from Orange parades over a century and a half.  In the late 1980s and early 90s, violence erupted in the mainly nationalist Obins Street.  At that time, this was the outward leg of the Drumcree church parade.  The police later prevented the parade entering Obins Street by blocking the Orangemen at a small railway underpass known locally as the Tunnel.  This resulted in bowler-hatted Orangemen, in Sunday-best suits, traditional Orange collarettes and white gloves, beating police officers over the heads with rolled-up umbrellas.  An unlikely spectacle of members of a Loyal Order which swears allegience to the Queen, in open and violent confrontation with the forces of the Crown.  The Portadown District comprises of 32 separate Orange Lodges with a membership of 1,400.  These men grew up in the what is called ""the cradle of Orangeism"".  The Portadown area is steeped in the Order's history and tradition.  In 1795, the Orange Order was formed in Dan Winter's cottage in Loughgall, just a few miles from Portadown.  A combination of history, tradition and to an extent a personal belief that they are in the vanguard of defending the Protestant faith, sets Portadown Orangemen apart from other members of the Order.  But for many nationalists, they represent little more than sectarian bigotry and Protestant ""coat-trailing"" personified.  A hundred years ago, when the lodges paraded back from Drumcree church to their Orange hall in the centre of Portadown, the contested Garvaghy Road section of the route was little more than a country lane.  In the late 60s and early 70s, the Ballyoran housing estate was built along the route and a population of approximately 6,000 people, most of whom are Catholics, lives there today.  With the changes in demography and the start of the peace process, came changes in the political climate.  When parades became an issue, nationalist and Catholic residents' groups sprang up in various parts of Northern Ireland.  Organised opposition to traditional ""Protestant"" parades through what were now mainly Catholic areas had begun.  Despite the history of confrontation in the Portadown area, the knock-on effect elsewhere has only been felt in more recent years.  Mass protests have been staged at Drumcree when the Orange parade has been re-routed away from the Garvaghy Road, although in recent years the numbers have gone down.  Elsewhere in Northern Ireland, property has been attacked and destroyed by rioters.  At the height of that violence, illegal roadblocks were thrown up in a co-ordinated campaign by loyalist supporters of the Drumcree Orangemen, bringing parts of Northern Ireland to a standstill.  When the Orange parade has been forced down the Garvaghy Road amidst a massive security operation, against the wishes of the people who live there, serious disturbances have ensued in republican and nationalist areas.  This year the Parades Commission has again re-routed the Orange march away from the nationalist area.  The last time Orangemen paraded along the Garvaghy Road was in 1997.  This Sunday, the Portadown Lodges will continue the ""tradition"" of leaving Drumcree church, marching a few hundred yards down the hill before being brought to a halt by the police and army barrier blocking their route."
236,"Sochi, a young-looking 17-year-old, takes the rusty M16 out of a sports bag.  He is a member of Eighteen - one of El Salvador's largest street gangs.  He waves the fully loaded machine gun around the room, giggling excitedly like a child, as he tries to work out where the safety catch is.  El Salvador's gangs are not home grown - in culture and style they ape the Latino street gangs of downtown Los Angeles in the US.  In the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton began deporting back to El Salvador hundreds of Latino gang members who had illegally made their home in the US.  They recruited thousands of local teenagers to fight the turf wars they brought with them from LA.  Today, some estimates put total gang membership in El Salvador at over 40,000 out of a population of 6.6 million.  It is easy to see why boys like Sochi have joined Eighteen.  His mother left for the US to seek work when he was six months old and he has not seen her since.  He says the relatives he was left with treated him so badly that he was forced to run away from home when he was 13.  Out on the street he joined up with the local cell of Eighteen.  ""I love my gang much more than my mother,"" he says.  ""When I needed my mother she wasn't there for me but the gang always will be. They are my family and give me the love of a family.""  The gang also gives these teenagers the chance to smoke copious amounts of marijuana; a powerful sense of identity affirmed by the tattooing of the number 18 all over their bodies; strong friendships; and the excitement associated with the ongoing turf war against rival gang MS, the other major gang in the country.  The breaking of such rules will lead to an 18-second beating at the very least, and execution if the crime is serious enough.  For teenagers who lack the boundaries of family, the gang gives them a set of strict codes and rules to live by.  Murder, however, is not forbidden for gang members. Instead it is a duty.  For years Eighteen has been engaged in a battle for territory with rival gang MS throughout the country.  Young gang members do not know why they are at war.  Pressed as to why he hates MS so much, Sochi says: ""Because they aren't like us - they rape their own grandmothers and they're dirty.""  Sochi and his friends relish the chance to kill their enemies and they never show remorse - killing members of MS is part of what it means to be a member of Eighteen.  The result is a senseless cycle of murder and revenge. If they are not arrested first, few gang members survive to the age of 30.  Although this has led to thousands of arrests, the appeal of the gangs for thousands of young Salvadorans has not lessened.  There is little evidence that the government's hardline approach has had any effect in reducing gang violence, although it seems to be popular with the electorate.  Apart from a few small social programmes run by the church, no effective social policy has been devised to deal with the problem.  Until boys like Sochi can be presented with an alternative, the gang will continue to be the centre of his life.  Asked how he sees his future, Sochi replies: ""Maybe I'll live till I'm 37, or if God wants, even older. Then I can be an old man and still in the gang."""
237,"In the early 1970’s Alan Bleasdale was working as a teacher on Merseyside and wrote a series of short stories about a teenager called Scully to entertain his pupils.  The stories were Bleasdale’s first broadcast work being played on BBC Radio Merseyside in 1971.  Later Bleasdale would write a stage play, two novels and a 1978 BBC television play about Scully, ‘Scully’s New Year’s Eve’ with Andrew Schofield playing the lead role.  In the meantime Alan Bleasdale had enjoyed significant success with Boys From The Blackstuff which when screened as a series on BBC2 in 1982 proved so popular that was quickly repeated on BBC1.  Scully was a 15 year old Scouser called Francis or Franny Scully whose adventures where set against the working class background in which he lived.  Boys From The Blackstuff was shown at a time when three million people were unemployed and reflected a national experience of working class communities.  After working on Scully for Channel Four, Alan Bleasdale wrote a controversial four part series for BBC One about a First World War called The Monocled Mutineer.  In 1991 Alan Bleasdale wrote GBH for Channel Four a seven part serial about the takeover of a northern city by political extremists.  In the late 1990’s Bleasdale worked on the adaptation of two novels for television Oliver Twist for ITV and Melissa for Channel Four."

239,"Bullying and theft is rife at a women's prison in north London, an inspector's report has revealed.  More than half of all prison inmates felt unsafe at Holloway Prison, inspector Anne Owers has found.  Prison managers said the need to improve women's feelings of safety ""is recognised and is being acted on"".  The inspection found levels of ""victimisation"" by other prisoners was nearly twice as high as at similar prisons, Ms Owers said.  Phil Wheatley, director general of the National Offender Management Service, said: ""Holloway has now implemented a new violence reduction strategy, produced following consultation with women on safety issues.""  Ms Owers said: ""Our major concern, and that of many of the women we spoke to, was bullying and pilfering on the residential units,"" she said.  ""Much of this was low-level, but appeared to be accepted as part of life at Holloway.""  The report also found high levels of self-harm among the women and criticised a lack of overall strategy for women's prisons and the jailing of women for whom prison was not appropriate.  Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ""Once again prison inspectors have found that our overcrowded prisons are holding many mentally ill women who should not be jailed."""
240,"Reinstated Leeds United manager Brian McDermott has vowed not to walk away from the club following a weekend of uncertainty over his future.  On Friday, prospective new owner Massimo Cellino attempted to dismiss McDermott, only for the Championship club to insist he would remain as boss.  McDermott, 52, reported for duty at the club's training ground on Monday.  ""Some people in the game said to not go back, but there's no way I could leave the staff and supporters,"" he said.  ""I got a phone call Friday night from the football club, Chris Farnell (a lawyer representing Cellino), to say I'd been relieved of my duties and a letter was on its way. Saturday morning I got another phone call from GFH to say that wasn't the case. A couple of statements came out and I've been speaking to the LMA, so we've now got to this stage where I'm sitting here again.""  ""This situation should never happen to a football manager and let's hope it never happens again.""  The former Reading manager admitted he had found Friday's events - he was called by a lawyer representing Cellino and told he had been relieved of his duties - hard to fathom.  ""All along you think that's very odd,"" he continued. ""You have to be the owner, so I did think it was very strange to say the least.  ""Whether it was illegal or not I don't know, but whoever sacks the manager has to own the football club.""  Cellino has agreed to buy a 75% stake in Leeds but has yet to gain the approval of the Football League.  The 57-year-old Italian, who also owns Serie A side Cagliari, must pass a ""fit and proper person"" test first.  ""As far as I'm concerned, I spoke to GFH, who are the owners of the football club, and I've had certain reassurances about my future,"" said McDermott. ""The running of the football club is down to me.""  McDermott, whose side beat Huddersfield 5-1 in front of a crowd of 31,000 on Saturday, added it was now time for ""some calm"".  He said: ""The only thing that matters is moving forward the best way we can and put what has happened to bed.  ""The ownership needs to be resolved very quickly. I've been given assurances that I answer to GFH and GFH only. When the football club does change hands, I will be told who the owners will be.  ""I don't hold grudges. The most important thing is the Leeds fans showed absolute class.""  Earlier on Monday, club director and GFH Capital executive Salem Patel told BBC Radio Leeds the club wanted McDermott to stay in charge.  ""We want Brian back and we want him managing the club again,"" said Patel. ""I was at home on Friday night and my wife started reading Twitter reports that Brian had been sacked.  ""To be honest, I was shocked. I thought at least I would be privy to that information if it was going to happen.  ""I called the chairman and he was equally surprised by the news.  ""I called Brian and told him it was not something that was authorised by us. As soon as we found out, we reacted.  ""We hired Brian, we hand-picked him and he has performed really well in the last year or so he's been here and we hope he continues to be our manager for the foreseeable future."""
241,"Gambella, just 100 kilometres (60 miles) from the Ethiopian-Sudan border, is inhabited by the Nuer, Anyuak, Majenger, Opou and Komo tribesmen.  Other Ethiopian tribes like the Amhara, Oromo and Tigre who are locally known as the Highlanders also live in this region.  And last month tensions between Highlanders and other groups over land spilled over into violent clashes.  The violence was sparked off by an attack on a United Nations vehicle which killed eight people, including three government workers.  Hundreds of homes were burnt down and the killings continued for several days.  The Anyuak group was blamed for the attack. Eyewitnesses contacted by the BBC then said Ethiopian Highlanders, supported by the military, had attacked the Anyuaks.  When I visited the villages belonging of the Anyuaks in Gambella, volunteer government workers were helping rebuild some of the burnt houses.  Akinyi Owuor, stood with her six children, in her compound where three huts housed them before the violence.  Desperation was evident all over her face.  ""Five of my relatives were killed. When the raiders came to attack our village we ran away. Then they set our houses on fire. I survived only because the raiders were after the men and not the women,"" said Akinyi.  The Anyuak men were not present when I got to the village, only women and children could be seen among the government volunteers rebuilding the torched houses.  Moments later, I was led into a hut in a corner of the village where the men had gathered - perhaps for security reasons.  It is here that I met Ojullu Ochalla, an Anyuak tribesman.  Mr Ojullu says that many Anyuaks have fled the violence.  He says that about 15,000 of them have fled to Puchalla in southern Sudan.  Many others, Mr Ojullu said, are still missing and their whereabouts are not known.  One of the village elders, Akim Obara, says the problem is far from settled.  "" While we appreciate the government's efforts in deploying troops here to keep peace, we still fear for our lives."" said Mr Obara  He said their attackers were still intimidating and abusing them.  ""We have even advised our children not to reply to people who abuse them,"" Mr Obara told me through a translator.  Mr Bithow says the government is aware of only 4,000 Anyuaks who fled to the Sudan-Ethiopia border.  He said that they had already dispatched two teams of government officials to convince the fleeing people to return to their homes.  Mr Bithow said that there was need to speak to the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) on the other side of the border to facilitate the return of Ethiopians who had crossed the border.  Although up to 5,000 Ethiopian troops have helped restore calm, tension remains high.  Their military presence cannot be a long-term solution to the problems in Gambella, aid agencies operating in the area have said."
242,"Indeed, when the first ever Australian Test was played against the touring British side of 1899, the Aussies ran out 13-3 winners.  That win came at the Sydney Cricket Ground, with the Australians wearing the light blue of New South Wales along with the Australian crest.  For the second Test in Queensland, they wore the maroon of that state and controversially dropped a number of NSW players in favour of home state players - the British side went on to win the game and the series.  This in-fighting and the precocious and formidable development of New Zealand and South Africa soon threatened to eclipse the Australians at union, but throughout their history they have been renowned for an open, attacking approach to the game.  They poached star player Dally Messenger, and many of the crowds followed.  The 1908 party to tour Britain remained strong, though. They were dubbed 'rabbits' in the British press, but to counter this they came up with the nick-name that would stick with the side - Wallabies.  In their first Test against Wales, the tourists fell 9-6 at Cardiff Arms Park.  The Wallabies went on to claim the gold medal at the 1908 Olympic games in London, but on their return home 14 of the party signed for league clubs.  The attractions of league and ravages of the First World War meant that in the 1920s union nearly died out in the rugby hotbed of Queensland.  To compensate, the NSW Waratahs produced a legendary team, whose 39 matches in this period would later be given Test status.  Amongst their notable successes in that period was an 18-8 win over Wales on their 1927 tour of Britain, with a side featuring the likes of Tom Lawton and Cyril Towers.  With Queensland back in the fold in 1929, the Wallabies of that year whitewashed the All Blacks in a series played in New Zealand.  In 1966 a Welsh team in the process of rebuilding lost to a talented and experienced Australian outfit for the first time, failing to capitalise despite leading for most of the game in Cardiff and going down 14-11.  Revenge was gained with Wales' first Test in Australia, a 19-16 success for the tourists in 1969, and two comfortable home wins followed in Cardiff in 1973 and '75.  Wales were still on top in the battles between the two countries, but Australia's progressive attitude to sport helped a remarkable turnaround in the years to follow.  With Wales seen as one of the leading rugby nations in the world, Australia were not shy of taking their help and recruited Ray Williams to boost their coaching and development.  Rather than imposing an alien structure on the Australian set-up, the Wallabies took what was best from the Welsh coaching system and adapted it to the structure and strengths of the union game in their country.  A humiliating 11-16 loss to Tonga in Brisbane in 1973 also led Australia to start recruiting players from the South Sea islands, a policy that would bear fruit in the years to come.  Great schools sides emerged from Australia in the '70s, featuring the likes of the Ella brothers (Gary, Glen and Mark) and Andy Slack.  Their style would be characteristic of all Wallaby teams in the decades to come - fluent and dynamic, but coupled with an iron will to win.  Play-making would also have a distinctive Australian theme - the inside centre being used as a decision maker and game-breaker alongside the fly-half, perhaps the classic pairing being formed by Mark Ella and Michael Lynagh in 1984.  The well-campaigned Wallaby pack admitted to wanting revenge after 1975 as, they claimed, their noses had been rubbed in the defeat everywhere they travelled in rugby-mad Wales.  The home side gained two tight victories, but bad feeling spilt over when Graham Price's jaw was broken by a punch from behind from Steve Finnane in the second Test.  Andy Slack claims that his side's winning drop goal in the first Test actually went to the right of the posts.  A rare Richard Moriarty try at the Arms Park in '81 saw Wales to an 18-13 success over the Wallabies, but it was the end of the golden era for the Dragons.  The touring Australian side of 1984 under innovative coach Alan Jones has its place in rugby folklore assured.  Playing with style and purpose to devastating effect, their young backs cut loose to record the grand slam over the four home unions and defeat a strong Barbarian outfit.  Their 28-9 destruction of Wales in a sodden Cardiff Arms Park included a Mark Ella interception try from Eddie Butler, and a virtuoso performance from new scrum-half Nick Farr-Jones.  The defining moment for the home side was when they conceded an embarrassing pushover try from a short-range scrum.  Third in the world  The powers that be in Welsh rugby refused to acknowledge the growing chasm between northern and southern hemisphere rugby, and this self-enforced blindness was perhaps encouraged by a classic win over Australia in the 1987 World Cup.  In many ways it was a meaningless match - a third-place play-off game in Rotorua, supported by thousands of Kiwis who became Welsh for the day!  Wales had been trounced in the semi-final with New Zealand, while Australia had lost at the death to France in one of the greatest games of rugby ever played - the omens for the men in red were not good.  Australian flanker David Codey was sent off in the opening minutes of the match, but the Wallabies led for the majority of the game.  In a thrilling finale, Cardiff wing Adrian Hadley crossed in the corner for a try beautifully converted by Paul Thorburn.  Wales won 22-21 to return in triumph as 'the third best team in the world.'  With the camp split and fighting amongst itself, Wales collapsed to a 71-8 defeat against New South Wales before losing the Brisbane Test 63-6.  Immediately after the tour Waldron quit on the grounds of ill health.  Added to the disasters of the tour was the fact that Wales had to face the Aussies again in Cardiff that year, during the group stages of the World Cup.  After the disastrous defeat against Western Samoa it was a game the home side had to win to progress in the tournament, but they were outclassed in all areas.  The Wallabies cruised to a 38-3 win. There followed a scare for them in Dublin against Ireland, but they eased past New Zealand in the semi-final.  England faced them for the final in Twickenham and - with the aid of a classic sledging campaign - Australia battled out a 12-6 win and became the second team to lift the Webb Ellis trophy.  Another Aussie win at the Arms Park followed in 1992, a game that included a memorable David Campese try.  The Wallabies' defence of the World Cup in South Africa in 1995 was a rare disappointment for them.  An opening defeat against the fired-up home side was followed by a knockout-stage exit against England and the boot of Rob Andrew.  Their record against Wales just continued to improve, though. Another disastrous tour of Australia in 1996 saw the men in red battered in Brisbane and slaughtered in Sydney.  It was closer when the Wallabies came to the Arms Park later in the year.  A Gareth Thomas interception try raised the home team's hopes of success, but in David Campese's 101st and final Test the men in gold rallied to a 28-19 win.  That was the last encounter between the sides before their quarter-final meeting in the 1999 World Cup.  If the Wallabies were again strong favourites, this time there seemed at least a glimmer of hope for Wales.  Graham Henry had built a strong team based around a formidable, heavyweight pack and - in front of a fervent crowd at the height of Cool Cymru mania - in Welsh dreams the chances were good.  Such skills were held by the Wallaby midfield pairing of Stephen Larkham and Tim Horan, and this, allied to the team's all-round footballing ability and desire to win, saw the Aussies to a 24-9 success.  Again Australia coach Rod Macqueen held the upper hand over long-time rival Graham Henry.  All their fighting qualities were needed for a bruising 27-21 semi-final win over the Springboks, and the final was a 35-12 walkover against a France side exhausted following their epic semi with New Zealand.  To become the only team to have won the World Cup twice (and neither time on home soil) was an incredible achievement for a country with so few union players.  Below Super 14 level there are hardly any professional players, but they have their structure right, the talent is nurtured and developed, and driving it all on is the ultra-competitive Australian attitude to sport.  After 1999 the Wallabies continued to ride the crest of a wave worthy of Bondi Beach.  They were an unfancied side going into the 2003 World Cup on home ground, but their aggressive, hard-nosed approach saw them overcome a team of All Black 'Galacticos' in the semi-final.  It was a tournament that an England team at the peak of their powers were destined to win, but the Wallabies stayed with them all the way, Elton Flatley's boot forcing the final into extra time before Jonny Wilkinson's drop goal tore the Webb Ellis trophy from their grasp.  The sustained success of the Wallabies increased the profile of rugby union in Australia, and for a while it seemed that the game could begin to rival rugby league and Aussie rules football.  With Australia having dominated the league code for over a century - and produced some of the greatest rugby talents to have walked this planet - that could be a frightening prospect for the rest of the rugby union world to contemplate.  They have slipped back somewhat in the last couple of seasons as they build towards the 2007 World Cup, and pressure on coach Eddie Jones has been intense after a Tri Nations whitewash.  That tournament exposed a lack of strength in depth in the Australian game, but they competed closely with New Zealand and South Africa and will come to Cardiff simply expecting to continue their 18-year dominance over Wales."
243,"Attempts by Biggs to be freed early have been turned down Jailed great train robber Ronnie Biggs has contracted hospital superbug MRSA and should be freed on compassionate grounds, his solicitors have said. Biggs, 76, who has suffered strokes and minor heart attacks and cannot speak, is in London's Belmarsh prison. His lawyers said medical reports showed he was in ""terminal decline"" and the case for release was ""overwhelming"". The Home Office confirmed an inmate was infected with MRSA during routine treatment at a local hospital. Biggs was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for involvement in the robbing of a Glasgow-to-London mail train in 1963. But he had only served 15 months of the term when he escaped from Wandsworth Prison. He has been held at Belmarsh since returning to the UK from Brazil in 2001. The Home Office said a Belmarsh prisoner developed a local infection after treatment and ""subsequent tests showed this to be MRSA"". Our client is a man who is extremely ill and can effectively die at any moment    A spokeswoman added: ""He has completed his treatment and further tests will be undertaken later this week to ensure the problem has been resolved."" Previous attempts to get Biggs freed on compassionate grounds have been rejected. Another failed appeal centred on the disparity between his sentence and the jail terms served by his co-defendants. The train robber's solicitors, Paul Martin & Co, said they have written to the prison authorities urging his release. ""The two consultant physicians clearly state the position as it is, namely that our client is a man who is extremely ill and can effectively die at any moment, to put it bluntly,"" the letter states. ""The Probation Service have already confirmed that there would be no problems whatsoever with regard to aftercare, and it is crystal clear that Mr Biggs is in absolutely no position whatsoever to even contemplate any criminal enterprise.""

244,"The northern right whale - one of the world's most endangered animals - could be ensured long-term survival if more effort was made to prevent fatal collisions with shipping.  In a new study due to be published on Thursday, scientists say that if just two females a year could be spared a needless death, the species might escape extinction.  It is thought there are now about 300 individuals left in existence and although the whales (Eubalaena glacialis) have been protected since the 1930s, their numbers have shown little sign of recovery.  This may be because these slow swimmers migrate along the eastern seaboard of the United States - from feeding grounds off New England to breeding grounds as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.  These waters include some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, and collisions account for approximately 50% of known right whale deaths.  Masami Fujiwara and Hal Caswell, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, US, have analysed over 10,000 right whale sightings since the 1980s.  The results could have important implications for the survival of the species. The researchers found that the age profile of observed females had changed dramatically in the last 20 years. In the past, females aged up to 50 years old were sighted; now, few live beyond the age of 15. Right whales need to be at least 10 years old before they can reproduce, and only have a calf every three to five years. This means an animal dying at the age of 15 will only have had one calf - not enough to sustain the population. The scientists say that if northern right whales are to survive, more effort needs to go into conservation measures, such as preventing ship collisions, rescuing whales from fishing nets, and even designing nets from which the whales can more easily break free. Preventing the deaths of just a few females each year will allow the animals to breed more than once and hence slowly build up the population, they say. Masami Fujiwara told the BBC that the ""mandatory ship reporting system"" introduced in 1999 was having a positive effect. After whales are sighted, warnings of their presence are sent to large ships in the area. Whalers drove the animals to the brink of extinction because they were the right whales to kill. Their slow speed in the water, their migration close to the coast, and the fact that they stayed afloat after being killed made Eubalaena glacialis an easy catch."
245,"Timothy from TV series Sorry: Not alone in still living at home Almost 1 million adults are still living with their parents even though they are approaching 40, a study says. The Prudential has dubbed those who refuse to fly the nest ""Kippers"", for ""kids in parents' pockets eroding retirement savings"". Overall, it said 6.8m over-18s live with their parents. Less than half pay rent, and many are given cash to spend. A Prudential spokesman said the study showed how parents needed to plan their finances ""for every eventuality"". The rising costs of housing and further education, together with a reduction in state support, have previously been identified as factors making young people stay at home for longer. But this survey reveals just how much a drain on resources an adult child can be. It found that many adults continue to live off their parents even after they have left home. Four out of 10 parents continue to help children out when they leave home - at a total cost, last year, of £20bn. Almost 5m helped with a deposit for a home Nearly 8m paid towards further education Nearly 3m paid for their child's travels 8m opened a savings account or investment product for their adult child. Angus MacIver, director of research at Prudential, said: ""The findings may come as a rude shock to parents who expect their kids to be out the door when they turn 18 - these days parents may be stuck with them for much longer. ""While this may not be a problem in itself, the real worry is how much these kids cost - and the extent to which they eat into parents' retirement savings. ""Whether our kids leave home at 18, 20 or 30 years of age, families need to plan ahead for every eventuality. ""Not only do they need to plan to help their children, they also need to balance that with the need to plan their own retirement. ""Kicking-off a savings scheme or pension as early as possible for their kids is an excellent start."" Do you still live with your parents? Why are more people staying at home? Send us your stories? They've been an absolute rock for me    Being 28, I have been forced to live with my parents through my own bad financial planning, and the collapse of the IT job market. They've been an absolute rock for me and I'm very grateful for it. However I am moving to the US and getting married next year. I have to sympathise with people, still with parents, that have no long-term plans, as the freedom lost, and the burden on parents, simply must get too high after a time.  Chris, UK I'm 22 and I still live at home. I pay rent, buy most of my own food and drink and help out around the house. Recently I've been more and more anxious to move out, and I have been looking at property. However, the cost of housing at the moment is ridiculous and getting a reasonable mortgage is becoming increasingly difficult. It appears that my only options available at the moment are to either stay at home, buy a rundown house or rent.  Mat, UK Once again those of us who can't afford to live home are mocked. This time by the Prudential. I am the main breadwinner in my household and with two ageing parents to support. I am fast becoming a financial and physical carer. Let's have a discussion about how many of these so called kippers are actually carers. We are destined to support OAPS and supplement their pension because the pension industry (including the Pru) have proved to be an insufficient way of saving for the future.   Anon, UK Why do family ties have to end at 18 years of age? Rather than investing in unknown quantities such as the stock market, parents should invest in their own offspring to create a more comprehensive team unit which would have obvious benefits for all (including less reliance on retirement homes, for example). As long as parents refuse to take responsibility for rearing their children, their children will be unable to take THEIR responsibility as adults.  Suzi, England I find it really frustrating being at home    I am 28 and still live at home - not by choice I must say. I rented for a few years before coming back to try and save for a deposit for a house. While renting this was proving impossible due to the high cost of renting and rising house prices. I find it really frustrating being at home and as soon as I am in a position to move out I will. At least though my parents are in a position to have me stay - otherwise I'd never have a chance to buy my own place.  Sinead, Ireland House prices are too high for first time buyers and rent is too high unless you share. I know so many ""Kippers"" who would love to be able to move out of home but even with a full time job can't afford to.  Howard Gees, England When I finished university I never went home to live again. Having got a job and a place to rent, there was no need to continue to strain my poor parents who had already had me for 18 years! Self sufficiency is also far more rewarding and the stepping stone towards making your own family and life. People need to get out more!  Anthony, England If you treat your kids like outsiders, expect to be treated the same    This is the very basis of our family values. East Asian culture provides us with a different insight into the values of family life and we do not consider children as ""adults"" par se, as far as living at home and depending upon parents is concerned. In fact, it would be considered greatly disrespectful to pay money to parents, unless there were financial constraints, which as parents, we would consider to be our great misfortune. If you treat your kids like outsiders, expect to be treated the same. Having family comes with responsibility that does not wear off with time - you can't have your cake AND eat it!  A. Patel, UK I had to move back to my parents home a couple of years ago as the financial strain of university has left me in massive debt and the cost of finishing my training before taking a full-time job is so high that it would be financial suicide for me to consider moving out.  Nick Diable, 24, UK The average graduate job (not with a blue chip company) gives a starting salary of about £19,000 within London. Add to this the cost of renting, transport, and general living costs, plus thousands of pounds of student debt, and what other choice do we have? Put it this way, it is not my ideal situation to still be living with my parents at 24, and is especially difficult after having lived away at university for 4 years.   Simm, UK It's not so much that I live with my Mum as such but we share a house with separate living quarters. I take on the duties of driving her to her appointments, grocery shopping, etc and she will prepare a meal for me roughly three times a week. Not only does it help me but it also ensures that she eats a decent meal with meat and vegetables at least 3 times a week. My Mum is now 82 and it was easier for this arrangement to work vs having her live 90 minutes roundtrip away and me having to drive out every weekend. The house we purchased together in town which makes life a bit easier for both of us.  Glynis Farr, Canada I wonder if the Prudential has taken into account that many adults who still live with their parents, myself included, pay rent or contribute towards the family income in some other form. With house prices continuing to rise in this country, particularly in the southeast, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get onto the property ladder. Without my parents support, there is just no way I could afford to buy my own property. My only option is to live at home and save as much of my income as possible.  Dan Lavis, UK In the event of having an adult child living with me when I hit retirement, they can stay if they must but there's no way I'm paying for them as well. I had to pay half my salary in rent to my mum when I first started work and, whilst I can appreciate that leaving the nest might be much harder these days, having carefully planned my future, I'm not going to have it sabotaged by feckless offspring.  Bridget, London, UK God help me, I'm Timothy Lumsden! I live with my parents because I've been unable to get a job and have returned to university to study for an MSc. Even when I do start earning money again, there is no way I can even begin to afford a house within the next five years.

246,"Tests in mice with scrapie - a disease similar to CJD in humans and BSE in cattle - showed the life-extending treatment works.  The method used by the German team involves molecules called special RNAs (siRNAs), Journal of Clinical Investigation reports.  These shut down the production of proteins that go awry in prion disease.  Prion proteins are very similar to healthy proteins, but have a slightly different shape.  When healthy proteins come into contact with the prions, they change their shape and become diseased as well.  This results in a chain reaction with more and more abnormal protein being deposited in the brain.  Professor Alexander Pfeifer and colleagues reasoned that shutting down healthy protein production using siRNAs would break the chain of events by depriving diseased prions of their ability to spread.  Special RNAs attach themselves to specific genes that hold the DNA code for proteins.  When the siRNA attaches, protein production shuts down - a process called RNA interference.  Professor Pfeifer's tested the theory in mice with scrapie, which is caused by an abnormal prion protein known as PrP-Scr.  They used siRNA to knock out virtually all of the healthy protein that PrP-Scr mutates.  While untreated diseased mice died after an average of 165 days, the mice treated with the siRNA lived much longer - for up to 230 days.  Professor Pfeifer, from the University of Bonn, said: ""Basically, siRNAs seem to be a promising therapeutic option for scrapie, CJD or BSE.""  But he added: ""It will take years before the method can be used on human beings.""  Dr Qingzhong Kong, an expert in prion diseases at the Case Western Reserve University in the US, said: ""Much more research is needed before RNA interference can be harnessed to treat prion disease.""  He said a big hurdle was getting the siRNA safely into the correct cells.  These treatments also carry the risk of upsetting the immune system and blocking non-target genes, he added."
247,"The Midland Metro tram system, which links Birmingham with the Black Country, has lost more than £16m since it opened.  The losses have been blamed on high running costs and a lack of passengers.  The tram system, which runs from Wolverhampton St Georges to Birmingham Snow Hill, has lost £16.4m since the network was launched in 1999.  Tram bosses also blame fare dodging and vandalism for the spiralling losses.  Mechanical failures have also hit the system, and transport chiefs say the knock-on effect has been a lack of confidence among passengers.  But a spokesman for Midland Metro said the reliability of the trams stands at 98 per cent.  Fares are now set to rise to recoup some of the revenue.  The latest figures show Altram, which operates the Midland Metro used by five million people a year between Wolverhampton and Birmingham, recorded an £11.4m loss in 2001 and £5m loss in the year 2000."

249,"Iraqi political groups have for several months been trying to forge a coalition government, following the inconclusive parliamentary elections in March 2010.  As no single party or bloc commands a majority of the 325 seats in parliament, the contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power.  This is the main Shia parliamentary bloc. It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA).  The National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous.  STATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power.  The bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents.  Mr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles.  However, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power.  Mr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections.  IRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr.  It brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion.  Jaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued.  A senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi.  The Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region.  The Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West.  The two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats.  The Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction.  This alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern.  It is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran.  The alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform.  While all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of ''national unity'', al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals.  This group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha.  Unity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki.  Like al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links.  The Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai.  It consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level.  Tribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006.  While the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs.  Smaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.

250,"The BBC plays a vital role in troubled times... and this is borne out by the sharp increase in audiences in Russia and Ukraine.  The Global Audience Estimate (GAE) measures the combined reach of the BBC’s international services - BBC World Service, BBC World News, bbc.com/news and BBC Media Action - across the world.  Russia has shown the biggest growth for a single market, with the audience more than doubling to 6.9m weekly as people turn to the BBC for trustworthy and impartial news. The BBC’s Ukrainian Service also reflects this trend with its audience more than trebling to more than 600,000 over the last year.  BBC World News TV shows an increase of 5m viewers, taking its weekly audience to 76m.  The Indian audience has grown, and shows signs of recovering from the last few years of decline. This comes thanks to investments in digital and TV for the Hindi Service, including the launch of the Global India programme on TV - which pulls in 6m weekly viewers - and an increase in World News viewers. These increases more than offset the loss of shortwave listeners to the Hindi Service.  BBC digital news services have continued to grow, with an 8m, or 21 per cent, year-on-year increase, bringing the digital audience to 46m.  Peter Horrocks, Director of the BBC World Service Group, says: “Today’s figures show the most successful year ever for the BBC’s global news services.  “The BBC plays a vital role in troubled times. We know that people around the world turn to the BBC when other impartial information is in short supply, and this is borne out by the sharp increase in audiences in Russia and Ukraine.  “Investment in TV bulletins and responsive mobile services for the World Service is bearing fruit. Radio will be a World Service mainstay for years to come, but as these figures testify, the way people access news is changing and we must continue to innovate if we are to flourish in the years ahead.”  Other findings of the Global Audience Estimate include:  Independent research from Newswhip has shown that the BBC is by far the world’s most retweeted news brand.  The BBC is currently exploring innovative new ways of measuring its audience impact around the world to reflect changing audience behaviours around the world.

251,"Charlton and Coventry fans threw hundreds of plastic pigs on the pitch in a joint protest that interrupted Saturday's match at The Valley.  The supporters were protesting against the two League One clubs' respective owners, and had also organised a joint march to the stadium before the game.  Play was delayed for about five minutes while the pigs were cleared.  Charlton went on to win the match 3-0, meaning Coventry remain bottom.  Fans of the London side have made repeated protests against owner Roland Duchatelet's running of the club.  At the end of last season, they threw beach balls and stress balls onto the pitch and Coventry supporters have also been calling on owners Sisu to sell the club.  ""It was different, I've got to say. Protests are something that's happened down the centuries, that's what we do.  ""When we're frustrated, people are entitled to voice an opinion and the fans have done that today. All I think is as long as it's done in the right manner and it's done safely, then that's fine.  ""Our focus has got to be that we're delivering on the pitch and we're working exceptionally hard to do that and to turn it around.""  ""The plastic pigs were hurled onto the pitch from all around the stadium.  ""It was completely simultaneous - and had obviously been planned in advance by the two pressure groups opposed to the owners of both clubs.

Evans, on loan from Manchester City, then turned goalscorer as he poked home Kieron Morris' pull back.  The goals came against the run of play as the visitors had been enjoying the better of the second-half exchanges.  Posh's Conor Washington had his side's best chance as his point-blank header was tipped over by goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.  ""A clean sheet, I think that's been a massive plus for everybody.

253,"The stereotypical belief that boys are less vulnerable to child sexual exploitation means they are receiving insufficient protection from front-line services, Barnardo's has claimed.  The children's charity says new findings reveal up to a third of victims are male.  The figure, taken from analysis of more than 9,000 records, shows a deeper problem than previously recognised.  Barnardo's says schools must teach boys about the dangers of grooming.  By analysing the records of 9,042 victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE) since 2008, University College London found almost one in three (2,986) was male. The eight to 17-year-olds included in the study had all previously been supported by Barnardo's.  Earlier studies had suggested boys accounted for a far smaller proportion of children affected by such abuse.  Only 11% of the 1,943 victims who gave their gender in a 2012 report on child grooming from the Office of the Children's Commissioner for England (OCCE) were boys. In the 2011 findings of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), 12.5% of 2,083 individuals were boys.  Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said ""urgent action"" was needed to ensure boys received the same protection and education as girls concerning sexual abuse.  He explained: ""We need to be brutally honest with ourselves. Society is miserably and unacceptably failing sexually exploited boys and young men.  ""The telltale signs are being missed because of a lack of awareness and stereotypes about the nature of this form of abuse.""  Mr Khan hoped the report would highlight the message that ""it is not just girls who fall victim to this horrendous crime.  ""All children must have the knowledge to protect themselves,"" he explained.  A 20-year-old man, who does not wish to be named, shares his story of being sexually exploited at the age of 12:  ""I was going through real difficulties in my life. I didn't see it as grooming at the time... I thought we were together in an intimate, loving relationship.  He was very controlling and he constantly made threats that he would leave me.  He would buy me things like mobile phones which would later be used to arrange encounters with other abusive adults.  I felt like this had become my way of life. My drug use got very heavy. Eventually I just became so unwell... that I was taken into hospital. That is how I broke free.  Boys don't fit this blueprint that professionals and the general public have about what victims of sexual crimes should look like.  Boys are expected to always like sex.""  But findings from NatCen Social Research have revealed that those dealing with children can be less protective of boys than girls.  The organisation's interviews with 50 professionals from voluntary sector CSE services and specialist CSE units within police forces, social services and youth offending services suggested that opportunities to protect boys, or recognise when they are being exploited, were being missed.  Dr Carol McNaughton Nicholls, who led the study, said boys were ""at risk of being overlooked as victims"".  ""We need to ensure we understand and address these risks, and protect young people from harm, regardless of gender,"" she added.  This has led Barnardo's to call for schools to provide ""high quality, age-appropriate sex and relationship education"" so that boys are equally informed of the dangers of sexual exploitation.  Meanwhile, the NSPCC has urged people not to hesitate before intervening if they fear a child is at risk.  The children's charity published findings from a survey of 2,797 adults which suggested almost two in three would worry about having their intentions misunderstood or being falsely accused if they approached a lost child.  ""We need everyone to understand that taking action is always the right thing to do,"" NSPCC director Peter Watt said."
254,"On the border between Lancashire and Yorkshire, slap bang in the middle of the motorway is Stott Hall Farm. Known to the truckers as ‘the little house on the prairie’ it's possibly the most famous farm in the land. But what’s it like living there? Its sole occupant is Paul Thorp, a sheep farmer with just his dogs for company and 2,000 acres of land. Living 20 yards from the fast lane has its ups, downs – and near misses - as Paul reveals. ""It has its moments. We’ve had a few visitors over the fence. They’ve put a crash barrier up to stop 'em, but before my time a wagon came through knocked the wall down landed on its side touching the garden wall. We’ve had plenty of accidents wagons and cars stuff coming through fence not that often but enough.” Work began on what would become the highest stretch of motorway in Britain back in the 1960s. Today, most people driving past believe the farmer at that time refused to move off his land so the carriageways were built around him. But is it true? Or is it an urban myth? Paul explains: ""It weren’t a matter that he wouldn’t sell the land for the motorway: he didn’t own the land, he’s only a tenant farmer. It was because of the geography of the land. The westbound carriageway’s a lot higher than the eastbound and they couldn’t get the two to sit together that’s why it parts. So it was only geography that saved the place. If they’d have wanted it they’d have taken it."" But making Stott Hall Farm attractive to the opposite sex has proved difficult.  Every weekend, Paul's mum Ros comes over to the farm to make the Sunday lunch, and while she’s there does the cooking, the shopping, the washing and the ironing. She says he could do with a wife: ""It's got good views, nice scenery, you can see for miles, and watch everyone hurtling past and think how lucky you are you’re not stuck in a car."" Paul Thorp on the plus side of Stott Hall Farm ""Paul’s had lots of girlfriends but when they find out he’s a farmer and he brings them here and they see what there is to do I think sometimes it’s a bit off putting maybe it’s too far out or it’s off putting I don’t know."" ""It’d be a lot less work for me if he got one and it’d be nice to have a daughter in law.” Paul admits it can be a lonely place: ""I guess you don’t want to be on your own all the time. It’s just a bit of a bleak place to bring somebody out in the wilds, all that traffic round you, and you’re a long way from anywhere – two miles from the nearest village. The postman only comes to the bottom of the hill and some days you won’t see anybody except those zipping past on the motorway – apart from people ringing you might not see anyone else to talk to. ""I just need someone who likes the outdoor life to have a breakdown outside and then come round!"" On the plus side... Despite the modern world speeding past his front door, Paul is happy to ensure the tradition of sheep farming at Stott Hall endures. ""It’s not a job, it’s a way of life,"" he says. ""You wouldn’t do it for a wage 'cos you’ve to put too much time in just normal hours time - you’ve got to want to do it."" ""But on the plus side, I don’t have any commuting to do, I’m up in the morning straight out the door and to work, good views, nice scenery, you can see for miles, and watch everyone hurtling past and think how lucky you are that you’re not stuck in a car."""
255,"The article defamed Prime Minister Lee and his father, the court found Singapore's High Court has ruled that the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER) magazine defamed Singapore's leaders. It ruled that the editor, Hugo Restall, also defamed Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loong. The case was about an article in FEER in 2006, based on an interview with Singapore politician Chee Soon Juan. The Singapore government has frequently resorted to its own courts to protect its reputation. Singapore state media reported that Justice Woo Bih Li had reached his conclusion of defamation by summary judgement, as requested by the Lees. In such a judgement, the court makes a ruling without the case going to trial, as it agrees with the applicant that the defence arguments are baseless, the Straits Times newspaper added. Damages are to be assessed later. FEER has a month in which to lodge an appeal. The Straits Times reported that lawyers for the Lees had said the article at the centre of the case was ""calculated to disparage both leaders by suggesting they were corrupt and unfit for office, and would sue and suppress those who questioned them as the questions would expose their corruption"". The article which had aroused the Lees' anger was entitled Singapore's 'Martyr,' Chee Soon Juan. It described the Singapore Democratic Party secretary general's battle against the ruling People's Action Party and its leaders. FEER had argued that the article was based on facts and fair comment, concerned matters of public interest and was a neutral report. But Justice Woo said FEER's defences failed or did not apply in Singapore, the Straits Times said. He said there was no doubt the defamatory words in the article referred to the two Singapore leaders, and that other references that linked the government to Singapore's National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and its disgraced director TT Durai amounted to ""defamation by implication"". Justice Woo found the article to mean that Lee Kuan Yew ""has been running and continues to run Singapore in the same corrupt manner as Durai operated NKF and he has been using libel actions to suppress those who would question to avoid exposure of his corruption"", the newspaper reported. He also found the article to mean that Prime Minister Lee ""is unfit for office because he is corrupt and he too has set out to sue and suppress those who question him to cover up his corruption"". Justice Woo rejected FEER's argument that the article constituted fair comment, saying the words in question were allegations of facts and not comments. FEER's argument that Dr Chee was entitled to respond to allegations made against him by the Lees, was also rejected, as Justice Woo found the defamatory words went beyond such a response. The allegation of corruption against the Lees was ""plainly an example of someone going beyond defence and proceeding to offence"", he was reported to have said by the Straits Times. Singaporean leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in defamation cases against critics and foreign publications, which they have said are necessary to protect their reputations from unfounded attacks. Singapore has also banned several foreign publications from distributing their products in Singapore, and has required those that do distribute there to promise to abide by stringent media rules."
256,"Maundy comes from the Latin word mandatum, meaning commandment, in Jesus's phrase A new commandment I give to you.  In the UK, Maundy Thursday of Holy Week is so named because it is recognised as the anniversary of the Last Supper and the beginning of the institution of the Eucharist.  Different churches have different ways of doing this, and different ways of understanding what it means, and what spiritual events are happening at the time.  The people taking part drink a sip of wine (or grape juice) and eat a tiny piece of some form of bread, both of which have been consecrated.  The prayers and readings in a Eucharistic service remind those taking part of that final meal and of the solemn words and actions of someone standing at the edge of death.  The Eucharist is a re-enactment of the Last Supper, the final meal that Jesus Christ shared with his disciples before his arrest, and eventual crucifixion. At the meal Jesus ate bread and wine and instructed his disciples to do the same in memory of him.  Christians don't say that they 'do' or 'carry out' the Eucharist; they celebrate it. In some churches, the person who takes the leading role in the ceremony is called the celebrant.  The Eucharist, which is also called the Holy Communion, Mass, the Lord's Supper or the Divine Liturgy, is a sacrament accepted by almost all Christians.  The Eucharist symbolises the new covenant given by God to his followers. The old covenant was the one given by God to Israel when he freed his people from slavery in Egypt.  The new sacrament symbolises freedom from the slavery of sin and the promise of eternal life. According to the Synpotic Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, the Eucharist was instituted by Jesus, who said the following:  Christians believe that the piece of bread that is ""taken, blessed, broken and given"" becomes the life of Jesus, the body of Christ.  But they don't all mean the same thing by it, and some of the biggest disputes among Christians are about exactly what they do mean.  Although all denominations recognise the importance of the Eucharist, they differ about its meaning.  Roman Catholics believe that the bread and wine that is offered is the actual body and blood of Christ and another form of sacrifice. They believe that although the bread and wine physically remain the same, it is transformed beyond human comprehension into the body, blood soul and divinity of Jesus. This is called Transubstantiation and is celebrated in the festival of Corpus Christi.  Protestants believe that Jesus made his sacrifice on the cross and simply follow the tradition of the sacrament in memory of the event, recalling its symbolic importance in the life of Jesus.  Churches also differ in how often they receive the Eucharist. The more importance a Church places on the sacraments, the more often its members will receive the Eucharist.  For Roman Catholics, the Eucharist is the most important act of worship. All Roman Catholics are encouraged to receive communion at least once a week during Mass. Some practising Catholics may receive the Eucharist every day.  Other denominations receive Holy Communion less frequently and usually services are held once a week or every few weeks.  It's very easy to get stuck into complex arguments about what happens to the piece of bread; what exactly it turns into, and how. There's a risk that if people get stuck in an argument about magical changes in bread they'll forget that they are part of the ritual, and the way they respond to it is a vital part of the package.  But you can get a great deal of meaning about the Eucharist without worrying about that.  Christians say that there is a common action in what happens to the bread, and what God has done with Jesus and with human lives.  And in all three of these actions human bodies, or pieces of bread become filled with the life of Christ.  Christians regard a sacrament as an outward sign of an inward grace or as an enacted truth. But that's probably not much more helpful...  Here's another definition: A sacrament is an an action made holy or special because of its believed ability to demonstrate a religious truth, or a truth about God.  Think about it like this... if someone says ""I love you"" and you believe them, that's great. If they say ""I love you"", and put their arms round you and give you a great big hug, you get the truth of what they're saying in a different and more powerful way. A hug is an outward sign of the love they have inside.  Or take some of the saints of old who gave their lives for others. Saying that you love all humanity is one thing. Dying to save others is a very powerful way of acting out the truth of your words."
257,"Adrian Ewer, group finance director for John Laing plc, the global contractor and house builder, said the building of stadium - home to this year's Rugby World Cup - had cost his company huge losses.  ""We've actually delivered a super project but a financial disaster,"" he said.  Mr Ewer was commenting on the group's interim results for the year which showed exceptional losses of £26m for the Cardiff project.  ""Cardiff is the cause for the loss in the first half. We're going for the line on Cardiff in terms of having to finish on time,"" said Mr Ewer.  He said the rush to complete the project before the tournament's start in early October had caused further unforeseen costs, but that the stadium would certainly be ready in time.  ""It's built to capacity now. They've already played games there.""  John Laing blames the losses in Cardiff on errors in the tender process.  ""It was a guaranteed maximum price job and we got it wrong on the bidding,"" said Mr Ewer.  He did not rule out Cardiff contributing further losses in the second half.  ""We're still finishing the job off. There should be nothing of the scale we've had, but no one could say we've actually drawn a line under it."""
258,"For such a mighty waterway, the Trent has a humble beginning.  The nation's third longest river - and second largest in terms of water flow - begins as a muddy puddle in Staffordshire.  The ""Head of Trent"", marked only with an old monument and rusty gate, lies on the edge of a cow paddock in the small village of Biddulph Moor.  From there it trickles down a hill towards Stoke-On-Trent where the first serious pollution enters the river.  In fact, the early stages of the Trent have historically been among the most polluted, causing many problems further downstream.  The River Tame, one of the Trent's early tributaries, is used to drain waste from Birmingham and further adds to the Trent's woes.  As a result, water taken directly from the Trent has not been used as a drinking supply in living memory.  Ruth Needham, from the OnTrent partnership, says: ""For many years the Trent has suffered from high pollution levels from sewage discharges and from run-off from agriculture.  ""It has not been worth the water company's while to treat it.""  However the Trent is a river on the mend, according to the Environment Agency.  Major pollution incidents have fallen from 165 in 1995 to just 64 last year.  Since its worst days in the mid-1960s, overall water quality has also improved along the river and its tributaries.  This improvement is best demonstrated at a place called Witches Oak Waters, just off the A50 near Castle Donington.  The site, managed by water company Severn Trent, is a quarry filled with water from the Trent.  It is being used as back-up water supply for Nottingham and Derby, to be drawn upon if other sources encounter problems.  The supply was recently trialled successfully, marking the first time water from the Trent has been consumed by people in the East Midlands.  ""It's now at a standard where we can treat it for drinking water, which it hasn't been for 70 or 80 years or more.  ""It's opening up a whole new possibility of supply for us.""  In addition to this, Witches Oak is also becoming a site teeming with wildlife, such as birds and otters.  It is the return of otters to the Trent which many conservationists are citing as the best example of the river's recovery.  Philip Precey, from the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, is a veteran 'otter spotter' and has noticed an increase in spraints (droppings) along the river.  He says: ""From the mid 1950s until the end of the 1980s, otters were extinct through virtually all of lowland England, but very much so in the Midlands.  ""Since the late 1990s, they have slowly come back, and hopefully back to stay.""  The National Otter Survey for England from May last year showed the network of the Trent and its tributaries had the biggest increase of any region in the UK.  Mr Precey says otters are a flagship species to help environmentalists convey their messages.  ""If you try to explain to people about wetland conservation, it all sounds a bit wishy washy.  ""But if you say to them it's about otters, that's something big and sexy, a big animal... people understand otters and then we can explain all the other things.""

The former world champions are facing their worst ever season after failing to register a single point so far in 2017 after a series of engine failures.  Brown said engine upgrades promised for Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix were not ready and the team is ""near our limit"".  ""Honda's working very hard but they seem a bit lost,"" he told Reuters.  ""We were eagerly awaiting this upgrade as were our drivers and it's a big disappointment that it's not coming.  ""It's not lack of effort, but they are struggling to get it to come together.""  Brown, who replaced Ron Dennis at the McLaren helm last year, added: ""Our preference is to win the world championship with Honda.  ""But at some point you need to make a decision as to whether that's achievable. And we have serious concerns.

""We're not going to go into another year like this, in hope.  ""There's lots of things that go into the decision and we're entering that window now of 'which way do you go when you come to the fork in the road'.""  McLaren's renewed partnership with Honda in 2015 was billed as a return to the glory days of their collaboration in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna dominated.  Yet McLaren remain without a race win since 2012 and their best finish this season was when Fernando Alonso, who started seventh on the grid, came 12th in last month's Spanish Grand Prix.  In March it was revealed McLaren had made an exploratory approach to Mercedes about engine supply in the wake of problems with Honda.  And Brown again raised the prospect of McLaren paying for engines in future.  ""Do I think you can win with a customer engine? I think you can,"" he said."
260,"The British welfare state that emerged in 1945 was the product of a century of struggle over how to tackle poverty - but its origins go much deeper.  Poverty was tackled by the Elizabethan poor law, which regulated vagrancy and obliged parishes to help the poor.  The rise of industrial Britain made the problem of the poor more difficult.  There was a growing social divide in the cities between rich and poor, as numerous social investigators discovered.  Meanwhile, skilled workers were creating organisations such as trade unions to lift themselves out of poverty - but their growing militancy worried the middle classes.  By the early 1900s all political parties had concluded that the state would have to play a bigger role in providing welfare for the poor.  The social reforms were, in part, designed to win the loyalty of the British working classes in the same way that Germany had introduced social reforms in the l880s to cement loyalty to the new regime.  Radical Liberals, led by David Lloyd George, took the first steps towards Britain's first welfare state after their huge electoral victory in 1906.  Among the key measures introduced were old age pensions, a system of health insurance, and labour exchanges to help tackle unemployment.  However, the Edwardian welfare state was incomplete.  It was limited to the working class, its funding basis was insecure, and little progress was made in tackling poverty among people of working age.  The cauldron of the First World War boosted demands for social reform and led to a permanent increase in the role of the state in British society.  Workers in munitions factories forced the government to introduce rent control in 1915 after a series of rent strikes, and in 1918 Lloyd George - now Coalition Prime Minister - pledged to provide ""homes built for heroes"" for returning war veterans.  The end of the war also brought a slump, particularly in northern industrial towns, that deepened into the Great Depression by the l930s.  By the time Britain entered the Second World War, the pressures for social reform were mounting.  And the shared sacrifice during the war enhanced the belief that ""never again"" should Britain fight for an unequal and unfair society.  The war also led to equality of sacrifice, with widespread rationing reducing the consumption of the rich but actually raising food consumption of the poor.  Many key social institutions, such as hospitals, were also nationalised for the duration of the war.  Early in the war, the coalition government began planning for post-war reconstruction. They entrusted the task to another Liberal social reformer, William Beveridge, an Oxford don.  By December 1942 he had effectively hijacked the process by publishing his own comprehensive programme of social reform ""from the cradle to the grave"" - the Beveridge Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services - despite the government's misgivings.  His report called for a universal flat rate benefit, payable to all, on the basis of fixed national insurance contributions. It was to cover old age, unemployment, and sickness.  ""Beveridge had combined his long-standing commitment to contributory insurance - to build moral fibre and to prevent a new means test - with a new commitment to the state providing a national minimum,"" wrote Jose Harris, his biographer.  Beveridge wanted to tackle what he called the ""five giants"" - want, disease, squalor, ignorance, and idleness - through a universal welfare state which would provide a comprehensive health service, vastly expanded public housing, free and universal secondary education, and full employment, as well as benefits for the poor and family allowances.  Full employment - and the relative prosperity that went with it - was the key to Beveridge's plan.  His vision was enormously popular with the public, and still forms the blueprint for the UK's welfare state.  But, as Howard Glennister, Professor of Social Policy at the London School of Economics, points out ""the idea that it was built on a post-war consensus is a myth"".  The Conservatives had opposed it, as had doctors who initially refused to join the NHS.  Meanwhile, the Treasury thought it was far too expensive.  The new Labour government, which took power in 1945, was keen to implement the Beveridge report in full as soon as possible.  But, in the severe conditions of post-war Britain, it did not have the money to pay an adequate level of flat rate benefits that would keep people out of poverty - particularly when their housing costs were taken into account.  So from early on, the residual poor law - now known as National Assistance - played a bigger role in alleviating poverty than Beveridge had planned.  And the idea of basing entitlement on contributions through national insurance - designed to give people ownership of their benefits and avoid stigma of a hand-out - meant that many people, especially women, were excluded from the system.  Family allowances were also never implemented in the generous way Beveridge had proposed. They re-emerged later - first as child benefit then as child tax credits.  Investment in health, education, and housing soon proved inadequate to meet the accumulated social needs.  When the UK welfare state was created in the l940s, it was the model admired around the world.  But in the last 50 years it has become the poor relation among European welfare states as continental economies spurted ahead of Britain."
261,"Italy coach Cesare Prandelli says he is going to resign after the four-time champions were knocked out of the World Cup in Brazil on Tuesday.  He saw his side exit in the group stages for the second successive World Cup after the 1-0 defeat by Uruguay.  Prandelli, 56, took over the Azzuri after the unsuccessful 2010 tournament and led them to the final of Euro 2012.  ""I chose a certain technical plan and that's why I am resigning, because it did not work,"" he said.  ""Something has changed since my contract was renewed. I don't know why.""  Prandelli only signed a new deal in May taking him up to Euro 2016.  ""I talked to the president of the federation and vice president Demetrio Albertini and gave my resignation,"" added Prandelli. ""It is irrevocable.""  Despite losing to Costa Rica in their second game, the Italians only needed a point to progress to the last 16 thanks to an opening Group D 2-1 victory over England.  But Diego Godin's late header, after Luis Suarez had escaped punishment for an apparent bite on Italy defender Girorgio Chiellini, sent Uruguay through to the last 16.  Abete said: ""I would like to announce my resignation. I do hope that at the forthcoming meeting of the board they can persuade Cesare to reconsider his position."""

263,"Out of the wreckage of the old Yugoslavia a new union is currently being formed between Serbia and Montenegro. This act of creation is a sign that a great experiment in the 'land of the south Slavs' (which is what Yugoslavia means) is finally over. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. This decision in Belgrade's federal parliament to create a new loose union between the two republics, called simply Serbia and Montenegro, and to finally consign the name of Yugoslavia to history, shows how the legislators have bowed to reality. The real Yugoslavia perished in the 1990s, during the wars that consumed it. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. Its proponents thought that south Slavs, that is to say people with much in common, especially their languages, who lived in a great arc of territory from the borders of Austria almost to the gates of Constantinople (now Istanbul), should unite and form one great strong south Slav state. Ideas for a union of the southern Slavs had begun circulating at least as early as the 1840s. In the regions that were to become part of modern Croatia, thinkers dreamed of a new Illyria - a name harking back to the days of the Roman Empire. Amongst Serbs, however, such notions were less prevalent. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. Dreams of a union, state or empire came easily to the lands of the south Slavs because all of the people who lived in what was to become Yugoslavia were then the subjects of others. And the fault-lines of empire divided the south Slavs from one another. By 1912, however, the first of the wars that were to convulse this region periodically throughout the 20th century was about to begin. Two small Serbian and Montenegrin states had already emerged and become independent - having shaken off the Ottoman Turkish yoke - but the rest of what was to become Yugoslavia was still part of either the Ottoman or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. With the first Balkan war of 1912 all that began to change. The new small states of Serbia and Montenegro, fighting alongside Greece and Bulgaria, managed to push the Turks back to Constantinople. Serbia and Montenegro conquered Kosovo, and Serbia took a large share of Macedonia. For many Serbs and other Slavs living within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Serbia was their champion. Inspired, and also helped, by Serbia's secret services, one of these young radicals took a pot-shot at the heir to throne of Austro-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand, who was visiting Bosnia on 28 June 1914.  Within months the old order was gone. The assassination in Sarajevo sparked off World War One, which in its wake destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Empire. What was to replace it? Many Croat, Serb and other south Slav soldiers remained loyal to Austria-Hungary during the war, but there were also some who did not. Indeed, some of its politicians feared that as Austria-Hungary crumbled Italy would seize as much of the coast of Dalmatia as it could, while Serbia would create a new greatly enlarged Serbian state, including Bosnia and parts of what are now Croatia - especially those areas that were then heavily inhabited by Serbs. The politicians felt that a deal must be reached with Serbia. A new union was to be proclaimed. The Serbian Army would save Croatia and Slovenia from the territorial ambitions of the Italians, and union would also save Croatia from Serbia itself. The kingdom was formed on 1 December 1918. Serbia's royal family, the Karadjordjevics, became that of the new country, which was officially called the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929 - when it became Yugoslavia. The country was carved up. Immediately it became clear that the union was not a happy one. Many Croats especially resented it, because they felt they had exchanged the domination of Vienna for that of Serbian Belgrade. Kosovo's Albanian population was restive too. Albanians were not Slavs and were bitter that Kosovo had not been able to join the newly independent Albania (which proclaimed its independence in 1912). Macedonian nationalists also resented the new state. So Yugoslavia lurched from crisis to crisis until finally it collapsed, with barely a fight, in 1941 - when attacked by Nazi Germany and Mussolini's fascist Italy. The country was carved up. A tiny extreme fascist quisling clique, known as the Ustashas, was installed in power in the Croatian capital Zagreb. They began a campaign of terror and genocide directed especially at the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia. Resistance soon began to emerge. In Serbia so-called Chetnik forces loyal to the old Serbian-dominated Yugoslav order began to fight, and so did a communist dominated resistance under the half-Slovene half-Croat Josip Broz - also known as Tito.  The war years were a nightmare of inter-ethnic bloodletting, fighting and wars within wars. While Yugoslavia was occupied and resistance was directed against the occupiers, in fact the majority of those who died, did so in fighting between nationalists of various stripes - royalists, communists, quislings and so on. Tito's forces, however, soon gained the recognition and help of the Allies. They also offered an ideal - a dream of 'brotherhood and unity' - that would link the nations or peoples of Yugoslavia. By 1945 Tito's forces were victorious, and crucially, although the Soviet Red Army had helped in the struggle, it had now moved on to central Europe. So Tito, not Moscow, would shape the new state. But Tito was a communist, loyal to Stalin. He wanted to model his country on the Soviet Union, so a federal state of six republics was proclaimed (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia). Stalin was wary of Tito, however, and in 1948 the two fell out. Yugoslavia was expelled from the communist bloc but Tito did not fall from power, as many had expected. He survived, and began to chart an independent course for the nation he ruled. Over the next 40 years Yugoslavia changed beyond recognition. It developed its own brand of socialism, and a society far more open than that of its communist neighbours. For them, and for many communists around the world, Yugoslavia seemed to be a paradise on earth. At home the federation appeared to have solved the bitter national questions of the past, living standards were high and, unlike in other communist countries, citizens were free to travel to the west, either to work or to take holidays. Tito's Yugoslavia also gained enormous prestige as a founder of the non-aligned movement, which aimed to find a place in world politics for countries that did not want to stand foursquare behind either of the two superpowers. Even liberal communism had its limits... Despite all this, and although there was much substance to Tito's Yugoslavia, much was illusion too. The economy was built on the shaky foundations of massive western loans. Even liberal communism had its limits, as did the very nature of the federation. Stirrings of nationalist dissent in Croatia and Kosovo were crushed. The federation worked because in reality the voice of only one man counted - that of Tito himself.  When Tito died in 1980, Yugoslavs were shocked and apprehensive. They had been prepared for his demise with the slogan 'After Tito - Tito'. But there was no new Tito. Without him the state began to unravel, as the governments of the republics began to exercise the powers that were due to them under the constitution. Dissent began to grow. Serbs complained of persecution at the hands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Croats and Slovenes resented the fact that money earned from tourists in their republics went to subsidise poorer parts of Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo. Albanians there demonstrated for their own republic, and even for secession and union with Albania. ...by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. Managing these strains and crises was hard enough, but by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. And if it was, what was to replace it? For Slobodan Milosevic, an up-and-coming politician in Serbia, the answer was nationalism. Seizing on the delicate issue of Kosovo, Milosevic came to supreme power. And so, Yugoslavia began to crumble. In 1989 Milosevic abolished Kosovo's autonomy. Croats and Slovenes feared that they were next in line. In this way a spiral of competitive and mutually fearful nationalisms began to destroy the country. Politicians fanned the embers of all the old divisions - Serbs versus Croats, Orthodox Christians versus Catholics versus Muslims, and so on. Milosevic clearly wanted to dominate all of the old Yugoslavia, but when he realised that he could not, he switched to another option, that of a Greater Serbia. History had scattered the Serbs especially, well outside the borders of Serbia. Milosevic argued that the federation meant that nations could secede from it, but not republics. So, he said, Slovenia - with no indigenous minorities - and Croatia could leave Yugoslavia if they wished - but then Croatia could not take its Serb areas with it. The stage was set for war. The stage was set for war. The story of those conflicts in Slovenia, in Croatia, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and finally NATO's war in Yugoslavia, has been told many times.  Now, prosperous Slovenia is looking forward to EU and NATO membership. Croatia is recovering from war, and its territory is intact, although most of its Serbs have fled or been driven out. Bosnia is divided into two, a shattered land still struggling to overcome the legacy of the war. Macedonia has been riven by ethnic conflict - but spared all-out war - between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians returned to Kosovo after the war there, but then 230,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians were forced to flee. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. Serbia and Montenegro have been impoverished by the wars and even today - as their new union is being formed - their future state is far from assured. Serbs and Montenegrins have much in common, especially their common Orthodox heritage, but Serbia is a land of some eight million people, and Montenegro has only 650,000 citizens. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. The new deal is for a loose union for three years, after which either republic can opt for independence. On paper it is a sensible compromise. In reality it will be hard, but not impossible, to make it work - if there is enough goodwill. The new deal, however, makes no provision for Kosovo, a UN protectorate since 1999, but still nominally part of Yugoslavia - or now its successor state. Its majority Albanian population has no intention of ever entering any new union with Belgrade, while its Serbs have no intention of permitting it to take the path of independence. If they can't prevent independence they (and the policymakers in Belgrade), would probably like to partition it, with the northern Serbian inhabited areas staying within Serbia. So, the final disintegration of the old Yugoslav state is not yet complete. Having taken their different paths, the people of the former Yugoslavia will look back on the past with different and mixed emotions. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country, and in Serbia and Montenegro most people are simply too exhausted by the conflicts of the past and the difficulties of life to really care. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country... But throughout the old Yugoslavia, and especially amongst those who grew up under Tito (except perhaps the Kosovo Albanians), the passing of its name will leave many with a wistful feeling - a feeling for which, indeed, they already have a name: Yugonostalgia."
264,"A Spanish judge has summoned the youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos to appear in court over accusations of fraud and money-laundering.  The Infanta Cristina, 48, has been linked to the business affairs of her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, who is being investigated for alleged embezzlement.  The princess is now a formal suspect and should appear in court on 8 March.  Throughout this long-running, and very public scandal, Spain's royal household has always tried to draw a line between direct members of the royal family and the scandal surrounding the king's son-in-law, Cristina's husband. That will now be a lot more difficult. The princess did not have to appear last year in court because state lawyers appealed against the summons, and the regional court of Mallorca, which is managing the case, judged that the evidence linking Cristina to her husband's business dealings was insufficient. However preventing her appearance for a second time could prove much harder. The year has not started well for King Juan Carlos. An opinion poll on Sunday suggested that 62% of Spaniards would like to see him abdicate, and the following day his advanced age and ill-health showed as he struggled to make a speech at an annual military event.  It is believed to be the first time a direct relative of the king will appear in court accused of wrongdoing.  Palma de Mallorca court judge Jose Castro ordered the princess to appear for questioning about her partnership with Mr Urdangarin in a firm called Aizoon.  Last year, properties belonging to her husband were impounded after allegations that Mr Urdangarin, the Duke of Palma, misused millions of euros in public funds given to a charitable foundation he ran.  The duke denied wrongdoing and was not charged with any crime.  One of the properties impounded is a large luxury house on the outskirts of Barcelona belonging to the duke and the princess, who currently lives in the Swiss city of Geneva.  The Infanta Cristina is the king's middle child. She has an elder sister, Infanta Elena, and a younger brother, Crown Prince Felipe, the heir apparent.  Judge Castro issued the summons despite objections from the anti-corruption prosecutor in the Balearic Islands, Pedro Horrach, who said he saw no evidence linking the princess to her husband's alleged wrongdoing, the Spanish newspaper El Pais reports.  When Judge Castro first tried to summon the princess last April, the bid was blocked by the provincial court in Palma de Mallorca.  On that occasion, she would have been questioned over the non-profit Noos Institute, which her husband had headed. The charitable foundation had received millions of euros in public funds, which were then allegedly embezzled.  The new court summons relates to Aizoon, a company which investigators suspect served as a front for laundering the embezzled funds.  The events are alleged to have happened between 2004 and 2006, when the duke stepped down as head of Noos.  Spanish journalist Miguel Anxo Murado told BBC World Service there was a sense of satisfaction among Spaniards at the way the case was being handled.  ""Most people will tell you that they felt more relieved than shocked and this includes even people who are sympathetic to the royal family,"" he said.  ""And this is because we had come to the point at which the issue was no longer whether the princess was guilty of anything but actually whether justice is the same for everybody in Spain. And this will probably calm things down a little bit. Whether it will be sufficient for many people in this environment of economic crisis, well that remains to be seen.""  Responding to Tuesday's announcement, the royal household said it had ""maximum respect for judicial decisions"".  News that the princess is now a formal suspect comes amid a decline in popularity for the Spanish king, 76, whose image was dented by a luxury elephant-hunting trip he made to Africa in 2012.  On Monday, he presided over a military parade on crutches at Madrid's royal palace, having recently undergone hip replacement surgery.  An opinion poll published on Sunday suggested that 62% of Spaniards wanted him to abdicate and fewer than half supported the monarchy in general.  However, the same Sigma Dos poll for El Mundo newspaper also indicated that a majority supported Crown Prince Felipe and believed he could restore the family's prestige.  Juan Carlos became king in 1975, when he oversaw the country's transition from dictatorship under the late Gen Francisco Franco to democracy."
265,"Four villagers in north-east Kenya have chased down and captured two cheetahs which were killing their goats.  The owner of the goats told the BBC that the cheetahs had been picking off his animals one by one, day by day.  The men waited until the hottest part of the day before launching the chase over a distance of four miles (6.4km).  The cheetahs got so tired they could not run any more. The villagers captured them alive and handed them over to the Kenya Wildlife Service.  ""I need compensation from them because the cheetahs killed most of my goats,"" Nur Osman Hassan told the BBC's Somali Service.  Correspondents say livestock is the backbone of the economy for the Kenyan-Somali community living in the arid north-east of Kenya.  Cheetahs are the fastest-running animals on the planet and can reach speeds of at least 104km/h (64mph).  Mr Hassan, from a village near Wajir town, said the cheetahs were attacking his goat herd over several weeks.  ""These cheetahs killed 15 of my goats - they were coming to my house daily to kill my goats,"" he said.  He said he decided to return to his village to organise their capture at a time of day when cheetahs get very tired and usually rest in shade.  ""I was sipping a cup of tea when I saw them killing another goat,"" he said, explaining that this was early in the morning.  He said he waited until several hours later when the sun was high to go after them.  ""I called some youths and we ran after them,"" he said.  ""We caught them and we brought them to the local authorities."""

Weir admitted that the lure of another year with the Ibrox club - with Champions League football a possibility - was too good to turn down.  ""I didn't look at any other options because any option other than Rangers would have been second best,"" he said.  Rangers are unbeaten in the SPL since Weir arrived, winning seven and drawing two of the games he has featured in.  The 54-times-capped Weir says that despite the fact his family still live in England, he didn't need much persuasion to stay in Glasgow until  ""When I got the opportunity to stay here for another year I didn't need much persuading,"" he added.  ""My family are fine, and it's not a problem."""
267,"The statue received backing from Maureen Lipman and Tom Courtenay A statue of Philip Larkin has been unveiled to end the series of commemoration events marking the 25th anniversary of his death. The dark green bronze statue, which portrays the poet in motion with a manuscript tucked under his arm and clutching a trilby hat whilst rushing for the train, stands seven feet tall on the concourse of the city's railway station. It is based on the opening line of his poem The Whitsun Weddings in which he wrote 'I was late getting away'. The statue was revealed at a ceremonial event led by Carole Collinson, the chair of the Larkin Society Statue Committee, with the Lord Mayor of Hull, Councillor David Gemmell, unveiling the sculpture. ""It's absolutely wonderful. You can see Larkin exactly as he used to look in life,"" said Mrs Collinson. ""It's important to honour him in the city of Hull; the city that he worked in for 30 years and chose to live in"" ""I think it will be a tourist attraction as the Betjemen is in St Pancras. I hope that we see crowds of people standing here having their photographs taken by the side of him."" Sculpted by artist Martin Jennings, who also created the statue of Philip Larkin's friend John Betjemen for St Pancras station in London, spent almost a year working on the project. ""It's lovely to be doing something that is a tribute to a man I admire enormously. Larkin was a genius and a wonderful poet."" Jennings, who also gave a speech at the unveiling event, had never met the Philip Larkin. His image of the poet was based on numerous research including photographs and an episode of the BBC arts documentary, Monitor, shown in 1964 in which Betjemen interviews Larkin in Hull. Sculptor Martin Jennings won the commission to create the Larkin statue ""I hope it's a reasonable likeness of him,"" said Jennings. ""What I've wanted to introduce into it is a little bit of the hesitancy that you might expect of a man who wasn't habituated to precipitant motion."" ""When you do actually see the finished thing it's quite a strange experience. It's the first time that it's become what you hoped it might be in your imagination."" Among the guests at the event were Hull West and Hessle MP and shadow chancellor Alan Johnson, who said it is important to celebrate the famous poet. ""I think the Larkin society has done so well to commission this statue and the fact that it is such a beautiful statue, beautifully placed between the Royal Station Hotel and the platforms just fills me with pride for the city."" More than £80,000 was raised for the statue from business, public and individual donations including Maureen Lipman and Tom Courtenay, who also helped with the project's fundraising. Larkin held the post of librarian at the University of Hull and completed many of his prolific works in the city.     "
268,"In its third report, the UN-appointed Volcker panel said Benon Sevan took nearly $150,000 in cash bribes.  Meanwhile, a former UN procurement officer has pleaded guilty to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from UN contractors.  The move came hours after investigators said Alexander Yakovlev had receiving almost $1m in bribes outside of the oil-for-food programme.  They also accused him of soliciting a bribe from a contractor who was involved in the oil-for-food programme.  Mr Yakovlev pleaded guilty to conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering, a federal prosecutor said.  The secretary general said that he was deeply concerned by the conclusions reached by the inquiry.  The oil-for-food programme was set up in 1996 to allow the then Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to sell limited amounts of oil to buy humanitarian goods and ease the effects of sanctions.  But since his overthrow in April 2003, the programme has been hit by allegations that the Iraqi government, politicians and UN officials from several countries illegally profited from the programme.  The investigating panel, headed by former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, said that Mr Sevan appeared to have received bribes of $147,184 from December 1998 to January 2002.  In its first report in February, Mr Volcker's three-member panel accused Mr Sevan of ""ethically improper"" behaviour.  They said he had tried to allocate oil sales from Iraq to one company, and questioned $160,000 (£89,000) in cash that Mr Sevan said he received from his aunt between 1999 and 2003.  Following that report, both Mr Sevan and another official were suspended.  Mr Sevan quit the UN on Sunday, after his lawyer said the charges against him were false.  Despite retiring last year, Mr Sevan had been retained on the UN payroll on a nominal annual salary of $1 for the duration of the investigation.  Mr Yakovlev had resigned from the UN earlier this year.  In his resignation letter on Sunday, the Nicosia-born Cypriot insisted he was innocent of any charges that would be made against him.  ""The charges are false and you, who have known me all these years, should know they are false,"" Mr Sevan, who worked with the UN for four decades, wrote to Mr Annan.  ""I fully understand the pressure you are under..., but sacrificing me for political expediency will never appease our critics or help you or the organisation,"" he wrote.  A separate investigation into the oil-for-food programme is also being carried out by the US Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, looking into Iraq's alleged allocations of oil to politicians in the UK, France, Russia and elsewhere."
269,"Prince William told the 63,000-strong crowd at London's Wembley Stadium his mother would have enjoyed the tribute.  Sunday's gig marked the life of Diana, who died in a 1997 Paris car crash, on what would have been her 46th birthday.  Sir Elton John brought the concert to a close after sets by stars including Sir Tom Jones, Take That and Rod Stewart.  Prince William and Prince Harry opened the six-hour show and returned to the stage at the end of Sir Elton's final set, praising the artists for an ""incredible evening"".  ""Thank you to all of you who have come here tonight to celebrate our mother's life,"" Prince William said.  ""For us this has been the most perfect way to remember her, and this is how she would want to be remembered.""  Proceeds from the event, broadcast to 140 countries, go to charitable causes favoured by the princess.  Prince William, 25, added that he hoped the show had raised ""enough money to make a difference"".  The princes later mingled with the stars of the concert at the after-show party at Wembley Arena.  In a video tribute, ex-South African President Nelson Mandela had earlier praised Princess Diana's ""energy, courage and selfless commitment"" as he urged the crowd to ""support the work that continues in her name"".  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and ex-US President Bill Clinton were also among those who recorded video tributes to Diana.  ""I think that in William and Harry, the qualities that made Diana special live on,"" said Mr Blair.  Earlier in the concert Prince Harry paid tribute to fellow soldiers serving in Iraq.  The 22-year-old was due to be deployed in Basra, in Iraq, this year, but military commanders decided it was too much of a risk.  ""I wish I was there with you. I'm sorry I can't be. But to you and everybody else on operations at the moment, we would both like to say 'stay safe',"" he said.  Sir Elton, 60, who famously performed a reworked version of Candle in the Wind at Diana's funeral, opened the concert with a rendition of Your Song, performed in front of a giant photograph of Diana by Mario Testino.  He was followed by '80s stars Duran Duran, who played a trio of songs including Wild Boys - which they dedicated to the princes - and Rio, one of their mother's favourites.  Status Quo, Sir Tom Jones, Will Young and Joss Stone all took to the stage in the afternoon.  But rumours that Robbie Williams might join Take That on stage proved unfounded.  Some of Princes William and Harry's favourites followed, including a poignant moment when P Diddy dedicated his track I'll Be Missing You to the princess.  ""Ten years ago, Princess Diana went to a better place,"" he said. ""Today we celebrate her life and I dedicate this song to her.""  The evening wrapped up with entertainment from comedian Ricky Gervais, who was forced to improvise when technical problems caused a minor delay to Sir Elton's closing set.  ""We'll leave that to the funny people - and Ricky Gervais.""  Simon Cowell, a judge on The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, paid tribute to the princes' efforts in organising the concert.  ""You've put on one heck of a show,"" he told them.  ""In years to come, if you ever get tired of running the country, you can come and work for me producing TV shows."""
270,"St Pancras is today celebrated as one of the finest examples of Victorian architecture and engineering, but it could easily have been a different story.  In the 1960s, the decade that saw the construction of London's Barbican (voted London's ugliest building in 2003) and the razing of Euston Station's Doric Arch, it is enough to say Victorian style was not exactly fashionable.  The demolishing of Euston's 70ft arch in the name of progress caused outcry among Londoners and sparked protests by the likes of poet laureate John Betjeman, co-founder of the Victorian Society.  Next on the government's modernisation hitlist was St Pancras and its towering neo-Gothic facade, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1868.  Originally opened as the Midland Grand Hotel, the structure was a triumph of style over functionality. But the hotel was unprofitable and closed in 1935.  By the 1960s, the building, renamed St Pancras Chambers, was home to British Railways (BR), and the floor plan was re-arranged with scant regard for the original features.  St Pancras might well have gone the way of Euston had it not been for a BR staff member who shared Betjeman's passion for conservation.  ""It was only thanks to a leak from a British Rail staff member that my dad learned about the plan to demolish St Pancras,"" says the poet's daughter Candida Lycet Green.  ""My dad then had the time to build up this incredible campaign to save the building.""  When it came to conservation, Ms Lycet Green says her railway-loving father was ahead of his time.  ""The Royal Fine Art Commission [the predecessor to the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment] thought St Pancras was awful,"" she says.  Betjeman argued it would be criminal to destroy a building whose name conjured up wondrous images of architecture and light in the mind of every Londoner.  He wrote: ""What [the Londoner] sees in his mind's eye is that cluster of towers and pinnacles seen from Pentonville Hill and outlined against a foggy sunset, and the great arc of Barlow's train shed gaping to devour incoming engines, and the sudden burst of exuberant Gothic of the hotel seen from gloomy Judd Street.""  St Pancras was given Grade 1 listed status in 1967 - the same level of protection afforded to Canterbury Cathedral and Windsor Castle.  In choosing the design for St Pancras, its owners, the Midland Railway, wanted something spectacular to outshine London's other stations such as King's Cross, Euston and Paddington.  When completed in 1868, William Barlow's 100ft high, single span train shed was the largest enclosed space in the world.  But Betjeman's victory did little to reverse the station's decline into a sad relic of imperial grandeur inhabited by junkies and kerb crawlers.  Its beauty - the sky-blue iron framework, the brickwork, the mosaics and even the light - had long since faded underneath decades of soot build-up.  The station was handed a lifeline when it was chosen by the government in 1996 to be re-developed to become the home of the new high-speed Eurostar service.  After a seven-year redevelopment costing £800m, involving 60 million bricks, 18,000 panes of self-cleaning glass, 300,000 new Welsh slate tiles, St Pancras is set to raise standards of rail travel.  A 7ft (2.1m) bronze statue of Sir John Betjeman, by Martin Jennings, will stand at platform level in recognition of his campaign to save the building.  ""The piece is an image of him as if he has walked into the station for the first time and gazes up at the roof,"" says Mr Jennings.  ""He's got a bag with his books and his coat is billowing up behind him as if in the wind of a passing express train.""  Mr Jennings read Betjeman's biography and his poetry, watched footage of him and worked closely with his daughter.  ""The statue is wonderful,"" says Ms Lycet Green.  ""It's staggering the way Martin has caught him and his stance when he comes into a great space like a cathedral or St Pancras.  ""He would always look up and draw his breath in wonder at the ceiling.""  What would Betjeman think of St Pancras today?  ""It goes without saying my dad would have marvelled at the new station. He would probably have said in typical fashion, 'let's open some bubbly'.""  With the station boasting Europe's longest champagne bar, he would not have had to wait long to raise a toast to this Victorian marvel reborn."
271,"A 5,000-seater stand was opened in 2004, but now the county board feels it is time for additional covered and seated accommodation.  Work has already started on the second phase of a £5m redevelopment scheme.  Included in the plans is a new control tower, press box, the installation of a lift in the stand, and new changing and referee's room.  The ground has already staged a number of floodlit games, including a senior club championship semi-final this season.  Last week it was revealed that a state-of-the-art training complex is also to be developed in Omagh.  The purpose-built complex will be used by all county teams, including hurling, camogie and ladies football.  It will feature playing pitches, changing facilities, an astro-turf floodlit facility, indoor hurling alley, gymnasium and other modern training facilities."
272,"Al-Qaeda initially planned to fly hijacked jets into nuclear installations - rather than the World Trade Center and the Pentagon - according to an Arab journalist who says he interviewed two of the group's masterminds.  The Arabic television station al-Jazeera says it will broadcast on Thursday the interview in which Osama Bin Laden's aides describe in detail how they planned the 11 September attacks.  In an article published in several European newspapers, documentary-maker Yosri Fouda said Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh told him they had decided against the attack on nuclear power plants ""for the moment"" because of fears it could ""get out of control"".  Both men are on the FBI's most wanted list and have a $25m bounty on their heads.  The FBI says Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is one of Bin Laden's key lieutenants, while Ramzi Binalshibh is said to have shared an apartment in Hamburg with Mohammed Atta, the alleged ringleader of the hijackers.  Mr Fouda said he was taken to a hideout in Pakistan. He says was told by a man there that Bin Laden was alive and well, but was not shown any proof of this.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told him he was head of the al-Qaeda military committee and Ramzi Binalshibh the co-ordinator of what they refer to as ""Holy Tuesday"".  Over the course of two days, Mr Fouda says, the men gave him an insight into how the terror group operates and how the 11 September attacks were planned.  At the end of his two-day interview, Mr Fouda writes, he was instructed to leave the videotapes behind so the faces of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh could be blanked out.  Despite promises that they would be returned, the videos never turned up. But, the journalist says, he did eventually receive voice tapes of the interviews.  He concludes that there is evidence of ""disruption"" within the al-Qaeda leadership, and that Bin Laden is more likely dead than alive."
273,"DNA tests will be carried out on the bones, thought to be those of Prince Alexei and his elder sister Maria.  Archaeologists excavated ground close to the site in Yekaterinburg where the tsar, his wife and their three other daughters were found in 1991.  The prosecutor-general is reopening an investigation into the case.  Archaeologist Sergei Pogorelov says bullets found at the burial site indicate the children had been shot.  He told Russian television the newly unearthed bones belonged to two young people: a young male aged roughly 10-13 and a young woman about 18-23.  Ceramic vessels found nearby appear to have contained sulphuric acid, consistent with an account by one of the Bolshevik firing squad, who said that after shooting the family they doused the bodies in acid to destroy the flesh and prevent them becoming objects of veneration.  The regional forensic bureau chief, Nikolai Nevolin, told Itar-Tass news agency that 44 bone fragments had been handed over, and would be subjected to detailed analysis.  ""We know that Prince Alexei suffered from haemophilia, so we'll have to detect the genome of this disease,"" he said.  The bullets found at the burial site would also be tested, he said.  Nicholas abdicated in 1917, and he and his family were detained. The following year, they were sent to Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains, where a Bolshevik firing squad executed them on July 17, 1918.  In 1998, experts exhumed and ceremonially reburied what were widely considered to be the remains of Nicholas, Alexandra, and the three daughters."
274,"Thousands of people are thronging a jungle in southern Nepal to catch a glimpse of Ram Bahadur Bomjan, 17.  The boy's meditation and apparent 10-month fast attracted global attention before he vanished in March.  Bomjan's followers say he is an incarnation of Lord Buddha who was born in Lumbini, in present-day Nepal, more than 2,500 years ago.  Eyewitnesses said that a large number of people had reached the jungle in Bara district to get a glimpse of him.  The boy attracted international attention earlier this year when he was reported to have meditated for months without food.  But there has been no information about his whereabouts over the last nine months.  Eyewitnesses said that he had become thinner. The boy told the local reporters that he lived on herbs, but did not take other food.  He also carried a sword. Newspapers quoted him as saying that he kept the weapon for self-defence: ""Even Buddha was forced to arrange for his security himself,"" he was quoted as saying.  His followers say he has been meditating without food or water and is immune to fire and snake bites.  These claims have not been independently verified. Scientists were unable to examine the boy as his followers said it would disturb his meditation."
275,"Jean Smythe, wife of Hartlepool artist Reg Smythe, unmasked the 5ft high bronze sculpture in the town's Headland area on Thursday.  The statue, by Shropshire artist Jane Robbins, captures the working class hero in a typically relaxed pose, but minus his trademark cigarette.  The cartoon first appeared in editions of the Daily Mirror in 1957.  The £20,000 monument now has pride of place outside the Harbour of Refuge pub, in Croft Terrace.  Mrs Smythe, who still lives in the town, said: ""I am very pleased that it has happened.  ""I would have thought that Reg would have really liked it, well I am hoping he would have done.  ""The people of Hartlepool have shown a real dedication in insisting this project would go ahead and they got there in the end and I would like to thank them for it."""
276,"The Dam Busters' dog will be renamed for a new version of the classic war movie, it has emerged.  Stephen Fry, who is writing the film's screenplay, said there was ""no question in America that you could ever have a dog called the N-word"".  In the remake, the dog will be called ""Digger"" instead of ""Nigger"".  The black Labrador was the mascot for RAF 617 squadron, which during World War II destroyed dams in Germany with Barnes Wallis's famous bouncing bomb.  Owned by the squadron's wing commander, Guy Gibson, the animal was run over and killed during the planning of the Dambuster raids, and was buried at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire - from where the operation was launched.  Fry told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It's no good saying that it is the Latin word for black or that it didn't have the meaning that it does now - you just can't go back, which is unfortunate.  ""You can go to RAF Scampton and see the dog's grave and there he is with his name, and it's an important part of the film.  ""The name of the dog was a code word to show that the dam had been successfully breached.  ""In the film, you're constantly hearing 'N-word, N-word, N-word, hurray' and Barnes Wallis is punching the air. But obviously that's not going to happen now.  ""So Digger seems OK, I reckon.""  Phil Bonner, from Aviation Heritage Lincolnshire, said: ""I think for the Second World War generation that word was acceptable.  ""But with my daughters growing up in Lincolnshire, they have been taught that the word is unacceptable now.  ""The film is not about the dog. My big concern would be if they watered down what the Dam Busters had achieved.""  The 1955 film, which starred Sir Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd, told the story of Barnes Wallis' struggle to develop the bomb and the subsequent raids on Nazi Germany - codenamed Operation Chastise.  The remake is being produced by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson."
277,"Cole Porter, in his rueful song Just One of Those Things, wrote of a love affair that was ""too hot not to cool down"".  I fell in love with the land of Israel when I first visited it more than 40 years ago. I fell in love with the land itself, with its ancient buildings and modern idealism.  Like any lover, I was at first blind to its faults.  I made close friends there, who remain friends to this day. I got to know many of its leading politicians, with whom I was on cordial and friendly terms.  I have met all but one of its prime ministers, as well as leading cultural figures. For years I was besotted with the place, and automatically supported it when, all too frequently, it had to go to war.  My film The End of an Affair tells of my infatuation with Israel, and how disillusion cooled down that infatuation. Working with the highly professional producer Charlotte Metcalf and a team of Israelis, I visited many of the places in Israel which had meant much to me.  I conversed with some of the people I have known over the years and met others for the first time. While I have my own distinctive views about Israel, I took care to talk not only to people who share my views but others who differ diametrically with my approach.  So I spoke to the former Labour Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, who made an offer of shared sovereignty of Jerusalem with the Palestinians, and with Ehud Olmert, the right-wing Likud Mayor of Jerusalem, who rules out any concession whatever to the Palestinians on Jerusalem.  Mayor Olmert told me: ""We will not agree to any political compromise on the status of the city as a one united city.  ""I do not believe that dividing the city of Jerusalem will bring peace.""  I also spoke to a fundamentalist Israeli settler in the Palestinian occupied territories who said that she intended to stay and that if the Palestinians did not like Israeli rule they could leave.  And also to Kali, a member of a kibbutz that is also situated in occupied territories, but who said she would be willing to leave her kibbutz if that would help bring peace.  Kali said: ""Better peace than a piece of land, it's not an empty proverb, it's something that I believe in very much.""  The result is not a conventional documentary, but more an evocation of feelings and emotions.  By coincidence, about which the BBC were unaware when they scheduled the date for its broadcast, The End of an Affair will be shown during the Jewish New Year, a time when observant Jews assess their actions over the previous twelve months.  I hope that my thoughts and the pictures accompanying them will enable others, Jews and non-Jews, to assess their own approach to Israel, its hopes and its tragedies.  Visually Israel is one of the most striking localities in the world, and Metcalf and her crew have made a wonderful job of depicting places ranging from remote landscapes to ancient ruins - together with the vibrant if sometimes messy society of the 21st Century.  In terms of arguments and differing points of view, the film certainly confirms the wry joke that where there are two Israelis there are at least three opinions.  How did I feel at the end of my visit to make the film, the most recent of dozens of trips I have made to Israel over the years? Am I comfortable with those feelings, or, to quote another sadder-but-wiser popular song, am I influenced by the emotion that ""when a lovely flame dies smoke gets in your eyes""?  There is certainly more than enough smoke in Israel today, literally so in terms of explosions perpetrated by Palestinian terrorist suicide bombers and demolitions by Israeli troops.  And am I right or wrong about how I feel? I hope The End of an Affair will give viewers an opportunity to make up their own minds."
278,"   Traditional ""rough and tumble"" schoolyard game British Bulldog declined in use as schools feared injuries and lawsuits. But in a backlash against a risk-averse culture, is it about to make a comeback? It was a playtime scene acted out over generations. A headlong charge towards your mates, a quick shimmy to evade their grasp and a breathless sprint for the ""safety"" of the other side of the yard. For decades, British Bulldog was a favourite among schoolchildren who bore the victory scars of scabby knees and torn trousers. But recently the fear of more serious injury - coupled with an increasingly litigious public - prompted many schools to ban the game altogether. While there are many variations, the game generally involves ""bulldogs"" trying to prevent runners from getting past them to the other side of the playground. Once caught, held or ""tagged"", the runner becomes a bulldog and the winner is the last runner left. 1: One bulldog (or maybe two) stands in the middle of the pitch, with the runners lined up on one side. 2: The runners try to get to the ""home"" area of the other side of the pitch without being caught. If the bulldog holds a runner for long enough to say ""British Bulldog, one, two, three"", then that runner becomes a bulldog. 3: The runners try to evade two bulldogs running back again.    A recent survey of 1,000 children by the Lottery-funded National Children's Bureau revealed a third of them had been banned from playing the game because it was too dangerous. Now the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, says parents and teachers should defy the compensation culture and encourage children to get stuck into traditional playground games to combat obesity. It named British Bulldog, alongside ""stuck in the mud"", tag and hopscotch, as games it would like to return. You just can't rule out risk altogether and we shouldn't be wrapping children in cotton wool    This has been greeted with delight by members of the Campaign Against Political Correctness, although they fear safety rules could leave a watered down version of the game. It says the name would have to be less patriotic and aggressive to suit modern tastes and maybe ""International Poodles"" would be more appropriate. And children would have to wear full protective body gear, including knee pads, helmets and gum shields. The campaign's co-founder Laura Midgley said banning British Bulldog was typical of the ""misguided mollycoddling"" of youngsters. Name is far too patriotic and aggressive, change to International Poodles Safe 'home' areas called on each side to be renamed. Home is not always safe for children No winners or losers - must be non-competitive Catching friends is too violent - instead players to shout ""poodle"" when they get within one foot (or the metric equivalent)   *According to Campaign Against Political Correctness ""Today's children get dropped off at school in cars because parents want to keep them safe,"" she said. ""But how many children die in cars compared to the playground? ""You just can't rule out risk altogether and we shouldn't be wrapping children in cotton wool."" Accidents are inevitable and people have to understand that children will fall over and get hurt, says Mrs Midgley, who is also a school governor. One long-serving Lancashire primary school headteacher, who asked not to be named, says health and safety rules passed down from central government have forced him to ban many traditional activities, including conkers. ""It's ridiculous. Kids could do things 15 years ago that we wouldn't dream of letting them do now. If it's slightly wet, we don't let them go on the grass in case they fall and we get sued. But kids need to run off their energy. Despite teachers' complaints, the Health and Safety Executive insists there is little evidence of school staff being sued and says prosecutions are also rare. ""We are not concerned with children playing games,"" says a spokesman. ""We don't stop people having fun, we try to stop people getting into situations where they die."" Hopscotch is also being encouraged The spokesman said if schools sensibly managed the risks involved in children's play, they would not be at risk of prosecution, and rough play was a disciplinary issue, not a health and safety one. There has never been a nationwide ban on British Bulldog, says a spokesman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families. In June 1985, the British Medical Journal reported how a 13-year-old boy injured his spine during a game. ""His neck was flexed forcibly while his head was against the floor, and immediately after the injury he had severe pain of the cervical spine,"" it read. It went on to say that although the boy was not paralysed, ""this case... shows that games such as British bulldog can be as dangerous as rugby football"". Boys have got to be able to climb trees    Edward Bainbridge knows its perils better than most. Five years ago, his 11-year-old son Charles suffered two broken arms when he was pushed to the ground by an older boy at Caerleon Comprehensive School in Gwent, south Wales. Now 16, Charles is a keen rugby player and not the sort of pupil to be pushed around but still suffers problems where the bones were broken above his wrists. Despite this, Mr Bainbridge, 59, said it is important to ""let boys be boys"". ""I used to play British Bulldog when I was in the Scouts 40-odd years ago,"" says the retired barrister and cub scout group leader. ""Kids are hardly allowed to sneeze these days and that's a bad thing. Boys have got to be able to climb trees. They will fall a few times, realise how hard the ground is and be more careful next time."" Rather than banning traditional games, schools should concentrate on ensuring there is adequate supervision of play, he added. Below is a selection of your comments. I spent some time teaching at a primary school in Nepal earlier this year. I taught British Bulldogs to a couple of classes, they loved it. It was by far the most popular game I showed them (they didn't really take to stuck in the mud). The first game resulted in a few grazed knees and a little fight between a couple of boys but happily Nepal doesn't the same over the top health and safety rules and the other teacher thought it was great too.   James, Aberdeen Having a low centre of gravity certainly helped when playing Bulldog. I had one or two moves up my sleeve too and frequently found myself the last man standing. I don't recall anyone being seriously hurt though. The people most in peril were other, non-playing kids (or 'traffic' as we called them). To be honest, the worst thing was getting scratched to death when the girls joined in.   Lee M, Isle of Wight, UK We used to play bulldog at primary school two years ago. The only reason it was banned is because people used to walk through the game and get knocked over by the running people. We didn't play it so that you have to push them t the ground or hold onto them we would simply tap them and that was it. The only time people got hurt is when they walked through the middle of a game (literally) or getting tripped up over other peoples legs. I don't think the game should be banned but a safer version (our old version) should be played instead.   Sean Quartermaine, Canvey Island, England I used to play this game when i was a youngster, it never seemed that rough, and now im still only 16, it shows how much has changed in such a short amount of time.   Matthew Buckley, Whitchurch We used to play British Bulldogs at our mixed youth club, on the church green. In our version the runner had to be held off the ground for the count. The struggles were tremendous but there was never anything worse than a few bruises and the odd black eye (mine usually - I was a bit of a scrapper).   Jenny, London We were all banned from playing British Bulldog at my school in the 80s when a friend was tackled, fell on a bag, and ended up with a Thundercat stuck in his head. His Mum never sued though.    Moz, Bedford I used to play British Bulldog as a scout. No-one got hurt and it was good fun. We really have lost the plot. I watched a kids programme with my daughter the other where custard pies were being thrown and everyone was wearing safety goggle. CUSTARD PIES!!! The sooner kids are allowed to play games that introduce a bit of risk and danger the better. At the moment they either have no understanding of what can be dangerous or they are paralysed with fear and wont try anything.   Jim Cox, Stretton Grandison Health and Safety professionals have never tried to ban any form of playground activity. The insurers are to blame along with lawyers and greedy parents. This is a litigation issue and should not be blamed on health and safety professionals who work tirelessly to prevent serious accidents through sensible risk management.   safetypractioner, London, UK     "
279,"Alex Salmond says broadcasters have 'a duty of fairness' The SNP and Plaid Cymru are refusing to rule out legal action over plans for three election debates between the main UK party leaders. The BBC and Sky have promised to hold separate debates between the parties in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the SNP and Plaid Cymru called their exclusion from the main UK-wide debates ""undemocratic"". The UK Independence Party want to be included in parts of the debates. The Greens also want to be included. SNP leader Alex Salmond says he will fight it in the courts if necessary. Plaid leader Ieuan Wyn Jones said his party was also taking legal advice, arguing that it deserved to be part of a UK-wide debate because there could be a hung Parliament in which the nationalist parties would have role in deciding the next government. He rejected the broadcasters' argument that the debate should be restricted to party leaders who could be the next prime minister. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I don't think anybody, including Nick Clegg, thinks that the Lib Dems are likely to form the next government."" The first of the 90 minute programmes, with Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Conservative leader David Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will be on ITV, the second on Sky and the third on the BBC. ITV's Alastair Stewart will host the first, Sky's Adam Boulton the second and the BBC's David Dimbleby will host the third debate. The format will be the same for each, although about half of each debate will be themed. There will be separate debates held in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland among all the main parties, which will be broadcast on BBC Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and across the UK on the BBC News Channel. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. It is understood Sky News will hold debates in Scotland and Wales. The SNP have pointed out that the courts prevented the BBC from broadcasting an interview with the then prime minister John Major during Scottish local elections in the 1990s, and Alex Salmond has made it clear that legal action could be on the cards again this time. Mr Salmond said he would be seeking ""guarantees of inclusion from the broadcasters, given their inescapable duty to ensure fairness and impartiality in election-related coverage in Scotland"". He added: ""It is entirely unacceptable to Scotland as well as to the SNP for the broadcasters to exclude the party that forms the government of Scotland - and indeed is now leading in Westminster election polls."" And Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Elfyn Llwyd said it was ""completely undemocratic"" as it would give the main parties an unfair advantage. He said he would complain to the Electoral Commission. ""Both Plaid Cymru and the SNP are in government in the respective devolved administrations and it is an insult that such important political voices are to be left out of such a historic event,"" he said. Parties hoping to gain their first seat at Westminster are also unhappy with the format of the debates. The UK Independence Party, which won more votes than Labour and the Lib Dems in the European elections, say they want to be included in segments of the debates covering the EU, direct democracy, immigration and the economy. Leader Lord Pearson said: ""Our position on all of those policies is very different from the three main parties and it would be very wrong for the British people not to be able to test us over our position in open debate ""Our presence would provide a real voice of opposition and make the debates far more entertaining."" A Green Party spokesman said: ""Why on earth shouldn't [Green Party leader] Caroline Lucas be part of it, when she has obviously got so much to say and when a significant portion of the electorate support what she has to say?"" He added: ""We are taking this as seriously as you might expect us to. ""We believe that with our proven track record of support and our distinctive agenda we should be part of any such debate."" The leaders of the three main parties at Westminster have each welcomed the chance to take part in what will be a first for a general election in Britain. Speaking at a public meeting, Conservative leader David Cameron said: ""I have always believed in live television debates. ""I think they can help enliven our democracy, I think they will help answer people's questions, I think they will crystallise the debate about the change this country needs."" Liberal Democrat leader Mr Clegg said he was ""delighted"". ""After a terrible year for politicians because of the expenses scandals, these debates will be an opportunity to start re-engaging people with politics... I hope an open, honest and vigorous debate will encourage more people to have their say at the ballot box."" The prime minister told the Daily Mirror: ""I relish the opportunity provided by these debates to discuss the big choices the country faces. ""Choices like whether we lock in the recovery or whether we choke it off; whether we protect the NHS, schools and police or whether we put them at risk to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy few."" The election is widely expected to be held on Thursday 6 May although there has been speculation that it could be called for 25 March instead.     "

City and Juve agreed a deal of £10m that could rise by £2m with add-ons.  27 September, 2011: City lose 2-0 to Bayern Munich with Tevez accused of refusing to warm up to go on as substitute 27 September: Roberto Mancini says Tevez is finished with Manchester City 28 October: Fined two weeks' wages for breach of contract related to Bayern game (£400,000) 7 November: Tevez flies to Argentina without the club's permission 22 December: City charge Tevez with gross misconduct for his actions since 7 November. (Six weeks' fine: £1.2m). Given until 7 January to appeal 21 March: Tevez returns for City as substitute in the 2-1 win against Chelsea  The Argentina international, 29, arrived in Italy on Wednesday for a medical and signed a three-year contract.  When the fee is combined with wages and bonuses due to Tevez in the final year of his contract, City could save about £27m.  The two clubs reached an agreement at a meeting in London on Tuesday.  Hundreds of Juventus fans turned up at Milan's Malpensa airport to welcome the player.  Juve announced his arrival with a picture of him alongside club president Andrea Agnelli holding up the number 10 jersey.  Tevez signed a five-year contract when he joined the Sky Blues in 2009 after previously playing for Manchester United.  City paid his advisors - who owned his contract - a reported £25.5m fee, although some have claimed the figure was £47m.  He has made 148 appearances for the club, scoring 74 goals, but the relationship with former manager Roberto Mancini soured in 2011 when he was fined and suspended following an incident in a Champions League match against Bayern Munich.  City must now search for a replacement but have said they will not pay the £53m asking price for Napoli forward Edinson Cavani."

283,"The note featuring Boulton and Watt will be introduced in 18 months    Two giants of the industrial age are to appear on a redesigned Bank of England £50 note. Scottish engineer James Watt and his business partner Matthew Boulton, from Birmingham, developed the steam engine. Bank of England governor Mervyn King said their 18th Century innovations were essential in driving Britain's Industrial Revolution. It is the first time two portraits have appeared together on the note. An image of the Queen appears on the other side. Inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt was born in Greenock in 1736 and carried out some of his first experiments with steam power in Glasgow. His partnership with Matthew Boulton, who owned the Soho Foundry in Birmingham, gave him access to the latest metal working techniques. Many of the advantages society now enjoys are due in large part to the vital role of engineering and the brilliance and foresight of people such as Boulton and Watt,    The resulting Boulton and Watt engine proved far more efficient than previous designs, and was soon being used in coal mines and cotton factories. The new banknote, to be launched in 18 months, includes an image of a steam engine and the Soho factory. Mervyn King said: ""So many of the advantages society now enjoys are due in large part to the vital role of engineering and the brilliance and foresight of people such as Boulton and Watt, whose development and refinement of steam engines gave an incredible boost to the efficiency of industry."" He added: ""The unique and rare opportunity that the bank has through its banknotes to acknowledge and promote awareness of our nation's heritage of artistic, social and scientific endeavour is an honour for us. ""The bank's choice of Boulton and Watt, a reminder of the invaluable contribution from engineering and the entrepreneurial spirit to the advancement of society, I think, well reflects this."" The new note will circulate initially in tandem with the existing £50 note featuring the first Bank of England governor Sir John Houblon, but the older note will gradually be withdrawn.     "
284,"Plastic bank notes are going into circulation in Britain for the first time.  The Clydesdale Bank will issue two million of the polymer £5 notes, which it says are more secure and durable than paper notes.  The bank is one of three in Scotland authorised to issue banknotes.  It is releasing the limited edition notes a year before the Bank of England puts plastic banknotes in general circulation.  The new Clydesdale plastic note features an image of the Forth Bridge and has been issued to commemorate the bridge's 125th anniversary.  The note also features a portrait of Sir William Arrol, whose company constructed the bridge among many other landmarks in Scotland.  It is smaller than the existing currency, which is made from cotton paper, but will still fit in cash machines, the bank has said.  Plastic banknotes are said to last 2.5 times longer than paper banknotes. They will survive a spin in a washing machine but will still melt under extreme heat such as an iron.  The note will also feature various new security features.  The limited edition notes will be available from branches of the Clydesdale.  So far, more than 20 countries around the world have adopted polymer notes.  The Bank of England will begin issuing them next year.  In 1999, Northern Bank of Northern Ireland issued a polymer £5 commemorative note celebrating the year 2000.  A plastic note was introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983 but was withdrawn in 1988 owing to problems with the ink.  Other adopters of the notes include Canada, whose last central bank governor - Mark Carney - is now the governor of the Bank of England.  Three banks in Scotland, including Clydesdale Bank, and four in Northern Ireland are authorised to issue banknotes."
285,"The International Cricket Council ended months of speculation by confirming the move in a press statement on Monday.  President Ehsan Mani said the ICC had been ""committed to unifying its administration for some time"".  The move follows an 11-1 vote in favour of the move earlier this year and will enable the ICC to benefit from tax breaks not available in Britain.  But UK Sport were quick to voice concern over the decision.  A spokesman told BBC Sport: ""We are obviously disappointed as cricket has a long history of being based in the UK.  ""We have been in discussions with the ICC over the last 12 months to try and persuade them to stay but it was not to be.  ""We put together an attractive package but in the end Dubai was able to offer a better deal, particularly with regards to greater tax concessions, that we were not able to match.""  In recent years Lord's has been the ICC's administrative headquarters and home to the game's Anti-Corruption Unit, headed by former Metropolitan Police commissioner, Lord Condon.  All financial and commercial activities, however, have been run from Monaco.  Mani said bringing both arms under one roof in Dubai was the ""best way forward for the international game"".  He continued: ""The package on offer to relocate the ICC to Dubai was very attractive and preparations are now in an advanced stage to move to the Emirate in August this year.""  The decision leads further credence to a belief that the game's power base has now moved to the east with Asian cricketing nations, primarily India, wielding significant financial muscle because of the game's dominant place in their sporting culture.  Mani said the ICC would, however, continue to work closely with the MCC, the owners of Lord's and guardians of the rules of the game.  ""Clearly, cricket's deep association with England and particularly Lord's as the historic home of the sport was a factor that weighed heavily in the Board's discussions on this matter.  ""Nevertheless, like many international governing bodies before us, it is clear that operating in the United Kingdom under the current system is not in the best interests of our members.""  UK Sports Minister Richard Caborn met Mani in January to lobby in favour of the ICC staying in London.  But Chancellor Gordon Brown had already made it clear tax concessions would not be available to sports bodies in his budget statement.  And by then it was too late after the vote by the ICC's Executive Board.  Even England and Wales Cricket Board chairman David Morgan backed the proposal, explaining his decision by saying: ""The Treasury's refusal meant I had to act in cricket's best interests.  ""We had to operate from one tax-efficient environment and Dubai was an opportunity we could not ignore.""  The ICC will be based in Dubai Media City for two years before moving into new purpose-built offices in Dubai Sports City.  ""To have one of the world's major sports choose Dubai for its new global headquarters is a significant compliment for the region,"" said Saeed Al Muntafiq, director general of the Dubai Development and Investment Authority.  ""It is evidence that leading sporting organisations recognise Dubai as an impressive and suitable location for maximising the impact of their sports.""  The ICC currently has 10 full member countries - the Test playing nations - plus 82 associate and affiliate members.  Last month, meanwhile, there were reports that the ECB was also considering a move away from Lord's to a site close to the National Academy at Loughborough University."
286,"Blair to get US Medal of Freedom  Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair will receive the highest civilian award in the US - the Presidential Medal of Freedom - next week. In his last week in office, President Bush will award the medal to Mr Blair, former Australian PM John Howard and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. All three leaders had been ""staunch allies"" of the US, particularly against terrorism, said the White House. The ceremony will take place at the White House on 13 January. Mr Blair, who stepped down as UK prime minister in 2007, is now Middle East peace envoy for the Quartet - Russia, the US, the EU and UN. He was one of President Bush's closest international allies, particularly after the September 11 2001 attacks on the US and the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr Howard was also a staunch ally and Australia was one of the first countries to commit troops to the war in Iraq. President Uribe is Washington's chief ally in Latin America and has been praised by President Bush for his support in the war against drugs. It is not surprising that this announcement has been left until after Tony Blair has left office and when George Bush is packing his bags    At a press briefing earlier White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said: ""The president is honouring these leaders for their work to improve the lives of their citizens and for their efforts to promote democracy, human rights and peace abroad. "" She added: ""Their efforts to bring hope and freedom to people around the globe have made their nations, America and the world community a safer and more secure world. "" But the Liberal Democrats, the UK's third largest party which opposed the Iraq war, criticised the award. Foreign affairs spokesman Edward Davey said: ""Tony Blair should be spending next week helping to fix the mess in Gaza, not receiving an award for the biggest foreign policy disaster in recent history and his silence over Guantanamo Bay."" ""It is not surprising that this announcement has been left until after Tony Blair has left office and when George Bush is packing his bags. It is simply too controversial to be sold to voters."" It will be one of Mr Bush's final acts as US president before he hands over to president elect Barack Obama on 20 January. The medal of freedom, awarded by the US President, is the highest civilian award in the US, alongside the congressional gold medal - awarded by Congress. Mr Blair was awarded the congressional gold medal in July 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, but he has yet to collect it. There was some speculation that unease over the Iraq war and Mr Blair's close friendship with Mr Bush made him reluctant to accept it while in office. But each medal is individually designed and minted and it was reported it was taking some time to decide on the words and images. The office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives told the Sunday Telegraph this week that Mr Blair was taking a keen interest in the medal's design, before it was specially made by the US Federal Mint."

""This is a major milestone and a huge step forward,"" said chairman Greg Dyke.  ""Our aim is to move into a new stadium in Lionel Road and to move there as a club free of debt.""  The land in question was identified by Brentford in 2002 as their preferred site for their new home.  Dyke added: ""We need a modern new stadium, to keep the club in Brentford, and we want a brighter financial future which will mean we can compete more effectively in the Football League. This deal will help us do all three.  ""There's still a lot of work to be done but today is a big day in the history of Brentford Football Club."""
288,"Sweden is the seventh country to allow gay marriage Sweden will allow gay couples to be legally married from next month. Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to recognise same-sex marriage, becoming the fifth country in Europe to do so. Sweden was one of the first countries to give gay couples legal ""partnership"" rights, in the mid-1990s, and allowed them to adopt children from 2002. The new law lets homosexuals wed in either a civil or religious ceremony, though individual churches can opt out. The law was passed by 226 votes to 22 and will come into force on 1 May. These are the years that legislation was passed by parliament ""The decision means that gender no longer has an impact on the ability to marry and that the law on registered partnership is repealed,"" the government said on its website. Six of the seven parties in parliament backed the bill, while the Christian Democrats, one of four parties in the governing coalition, refused. The Lutheran Church, the largest church in Sweden, has offered to bless gay partnerships since January 2007, but has still not given formal backing to the term ""marriage"", and will allow individual pastors to refuse to carry out gay weddings. Sweden has become the fifth European country, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Norway, to recognise same-sex marriage. Elsewhere, Canada and South Africa have also passed such legislation, as have some US states and local authorities in other countries.     "
289,"The Bank was forced to write to the government after the Consumer Prices Index rose to more than one percentage point above the government's target.  The increase is expected to trigger a further rise in UK interest rates.  Figures also showed that a wider inflation measure, RPI, rose to 4.8% in March, up from 4.6% the month before.  The pound soared on currency markets as a result, briefly passing through the $2 level.  Opposition parties seized on the news as a chance to attack Chancellor Gordon Brown on a day when he faces a no-confidence motion.  ""Gordon Brown's reputation for economic competence is unravelling before our eyes"", said Conservative shadow chancellor George Osborne.  Liberal Democrat economics spokesman Vince Cable said the news ""gives lie to the claim that the Government has permanently achieved a nirvana of steady growth without inflation"".  The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, was forced to write the letter of explanation to Chancellor Gordon Brown because the CPI measure was more than one percentage point above the government's 2% target.  It is the first such letter written by the Bank since the government handed it control of monetary policy in 1997.  In it, Mr King said that inflation had exceeded 3% in March because since February oil prices had risen by about 25%, reversing part of the fall in prices seen in the second half of last year. The oil price rise pushed up petrol prices.  In addition, some of the falls on food prices seen a year ago were not repeated in March this year, while retailers pushed up the prices of furniture and furnishings.  However, Mr King said that, ""at first sight"", the price data seemed unlikely to alter the outlook painted in the Bank's last quarterly inflation report.  And he said that the CPI measure was ""likely to fall back within a matter of months"" as big increases in household gas and electricity prices that occurred a year ago cease to have an impact on inflation.  In his reply to Mr King, the chancellor said he noted the reasons the Bank had given for the rise in inflation and welcomed the Bank's confirmation it would continue to set interest rates to meet the 2% inflation target in the medium term.  ""I agree that the Monetary Policy Committee's approach is appropriate to meet the government's monetary policy objectives - namely to maintain price stability,"" Mr Brown said.  The Bank of England has raised UK rates three times since August last year in an attempt to contain inflationary pressures.  At its last rate-setting meeting earlier this month it kept rates at 5.25%, but following the latest inflation figures analysts now expect the Bank to lift rates in May to 5.5%, and possibly beyond.  ""This is a thoroughly nasty set of data that essentially guarantees that the Bank of England will raise interest rates by a further 25 basis points to 5.5% in May,"" said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight.  ""Furthermore, there is a markedly increased possibility that interest rates will rise further still further out.  ""Worryingly core inflation climbed to 1.9% in March, while the rise in retail price inflation to a near 16-year high of 4.8% maintains the risk that wages could yet move higher.""  The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said CPI inflation jumped 0.5% in the month, a rise which lifted the annual rate to 3.1% - the highest since the series began in January 1997 - from February's rate of 2.8%.  ""There appears to be more inflation in the system which is demand led than what we had previously expected, allowing retailers and manufacturers to restore their margins,"" said Jonathan Said, senior economist at the CEBR.  ""However, the fact that the Bank of England kept rates on hold in April probably means that their medium term inflation expectation has remained unchanged - implying that the central forecast should remain one of rates peaking at 5.5% in May.  ""Nevertheless, increased upside inflation risks are emerging, so that there is a larger chance that inflation will struggle to get back to target as soon as we had expected."""
290,"Belfast Giants chief Albert Maasland insists that the refusal of Ice Hockey UK to affiliate the newly-formed Elite League will prevent it from starting in September.  The sport's governing body in Britain announced on Friday that it would not sanction the new league for which eight teams have already committed.  A statement from Ice Hockey UK said that the new league would ""not be in the best interests of the sport in Britain"".  Ice Hockey UK remains keen than the former Superleague clubs should merge with the second-tier Findus British National League to create a new league.  However, Giants managing director Maasland said that the development was not a ""major worry"".  ""There are many leagues around the world that are not affiliated with the International Ice Hockey Federation through their local country governing body,"" said Maasland.  ""These include the National Hockey League, the East Coast League, in fact most of the North American Leagues are not affiliated.  ""We will if it comes down to it operate the Elite League without the sanction although obviously we would like to be affiliated by the governing body"".  Maasland said he had been ""surprised"" by the Ice Hockey UK statement.  ""As far as we were concerned, we are still in discussions (with Ice Hockey UK) and we've not been officially told the grounds on why they've refused to affiliate us"".  The new format is intended to replace the Superleague which ran into financial trouble this season.  ""After careful consideration and much soul searching, the board of directors today decided not to affiliate the Elite League,"" said Friday's Ice Hockey UK statement.  ""The Ice Hockey UK board of directors are of the opinion that the only way forward for ice hockey is the ideal of one strong league.  ""Ice Hockey UK has brokered several meetings between the existing Findus British National League and, initially, the remaining teams in the Ice Hockey Superleague.  ""Ice Hockey UK was notified on the April 30, 2003 that the Ice Hockey Superleague had called in the liquidators and the league's substantial debt to Ice Hockey UK could not now be met.  ""Ice Hockey UK received the first official approach from the Elite League whilst in Croatia at the World Championships, although press releases had already been made by the Elite League stating they were up and running.  ""Ice Hockey UK called another meeting between the Findus British National League and the Elite League teams asking them to find a way for the two groups to amalgamate and go forward as one completely new league.  ""It was decided to try and come to agreement with the Elite League after another approach was made.  ""A deadline of May 30 was imposed. No agreement has been reached at this time. Ice Hockey UK, therefore, has not affiliated the Elite League."""
291,"It said mail had been collected from a sixth of its 118,000 post boxes and 50 business customers on Sundays.  Accounting for 1% of all mail posted, items collected on Sundays cost four times as much to process as those collected on other days, it said.  The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said the move would erode post services and cut staff's earning potential.  The move comes as thousands of postal workers are set to start voting on a new deal on pay and conditions after a series of strikes.  The firm says it is now operating in a competitive postal market and stopping the Sunday collection was a way of reducing costs ""with the minimum of disruption"".  ""Given the disproportionate cost of providing Sunday collections, and the low importance many consumers attach to such collections, ceasing this service makes commercial sense,"" it said.  The company has insisted it needs to modernise to survive as a business in the highly competitive mail industry.  But a CWU spokeman accused Royal Mail of ""another reduction in the public service, caused by the race to the bottom with competition and the pursuit of profit"".  ""The union again calls on the government to undertake an urgent review of the impact of competition on postal services."""
292,"Standards watchdog Sir Christopher Kelly has said MPs must stop employing relatives if people are to be persuaded that expenses have been ""cleaned up"". He told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was ""essential"" the system was free from any appearance of abuse. More than 200 MPs employ relatives but Sir Christopher's inquiry last year recommended the practice be phased out. Some spouses have said they may launch a legal challenge against any effort to ban them from working for MPs. Sir Christopher - whose committee on standards in public life carried out a seven-month inquiry into MPs' expenses last year - was appearing before Northern Ireland's standards and privileges committee. I think that it is absolutely essential now that in Westminster people should be able to demonstrate that the expenses system has been completely overhauled    He recommended in November that MPs be banned from employing relatives. But it is for another body, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, to decide which proposals to take forward. Its head, Sir Ian Kennedy, has said he believes using family as staff should be banned but has invited other views in consultation on Sir Christopher's proposals. Sir Christopher told the assembly on Wednesday that the practice should end - pointing out it was stopping in Scotland, at the US House of Representatives and the European Parliament. He said: ""Unless and until that happens I don't think that the Westminster Parliament will be able to feel, and to demonstrate, that the arrangements for supporting MPs are being completely cleaned up. ""And I think that it is absolutely essential now that in Westminster people should be able to demonstrate that the expenses system has been completely overhauled and is free not just from any abuse but from any appearance of abuse as well."" He said there had been claims the ruling fell foul of various forms of legislation but he had received legal advice that there would be a ""perfectly adequate defence"" to that. And, while he accepted that many spouses worked beyond what would be expected from other staff members, he said there was a widespread presumption that politicians ""can't be trusted"" and in no other profession - with the partial exception of GPs - was it considered appropriate to employ relatives at public expense. The Northern Ireland Assembly is looking at setting up its own standards commissioner. Sir Christopher recommended whoever it was be given powers to carry out investigations without a formal complaint being made. He made a similar recommendation for Westminster's standards commissioner, John Lyon. People did not always understand why, when there were allegations flying around in the newspapers, politicians were not being investigated, he said. Asked how a commissioner could determine whether to begin an investigation, Sir Christopher said that, in the case of media stories, he or she could contact the journalist in question and ask what evidence they had. Then they could decide whether there was a ""prima facie"" case or whether it was just ""malicious gossip"" - in which case he or she could make a public statement saying ""there was nothing of substance to support the allegation"". Sir Christopher said it was a ""great shame"" that blameless MPs had been tarnished by the expenses scandal, but there ""were many people who must have known that the expenses system was flawed"" and who stood aside and were therefore ""guilty of going along with a flawed system"".

293,"A Sudanese court has sentenced a woman to hang for apostasy - the abandonment of her religious faith - after she married a Christian man.  Amnesty International condemned the sentence, handed down by a judge in Khartoum, as ""appalling and abhorrent"".  Local media report the sentence on the woman, who is pregnant, would not be carried out for two years after she had given birth.  Sudan has a majority Muslim population, which is governed by Islamic law.  ""We gave you three days to recant but you insist on not returning to Islam. I sentence you to be hanged to death,"" the judge told the woman, AFP reports.  Western embassies and rights groups had urged Sudan to respect the right of the pregnant woman to choose her religion.  The judge also sentenced the woman to 100 lashes after convicting her of adultery - because her marriage to a Christian man was not valid under Islamic law.  This will reportedly be carried out when she has recovered from giving birth.  Earlier in the hearing, an Islamic cleric spoke with her in a caged dock for about 30 minutes, AFP reports.  Then she calmly told the judge: ""I am a Christian and I never committed apostasy.""  Amnesty International said the woman, Meriam Yehya Ibrahim Ishag, was raised as an Orthodox Christian, her mother's religion, because her father, a Muslim, was reportedly absent during her childhood.  In court, the judge addressed her by her Muslim name, Adraf Al-Hadi Mohammed Abdullah.  She was convicted of adultery on the grounds that her marriage to a Christian man from South Sudan was void under Sudan's version of Islamic law, which says Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslims.  The woman was originally sentenced to death on Sunday but given until Thursday to return to Islam.  There is a long-running debate in Islam over whether apostasy is a crime. Some liberal scholars hold the view that it is not - and back up their argument by citing the Koranic verse which states: ""There shall be no compulsion in religion."" Others say apostasy is tantamount to treason - and refer to what Prophet Muhammad said: ""It is not permissible to spill the blood of a Muslim except in three [instances]: A life for a life; a married person who commits adultery; and one who forsakes his religion and separates from the community."" The latter is the dominant view in conservative Muslim states such as Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and the cause of much religious tension.  There were small groups of protesters outside the court - both her supporters and those who back the punishment.  About 50 people chanting ""No to executing Meriam"" were confronted by a smaller group who supported the verdict, but there was no violence.  Amnesty's Sudan researcher Manar Idriss condemned the punishments, saying apostasy and adultery should not be considered crimes.  ""The fact that a woman has been sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion is appalling and abhorrent,"" she said.  The BBC's Osman Mohamed, in Khartoum, says death sentences are rarely carried out in Sudan.  Her lawyers plan an appeal to a higher court to get the sentence overturned.  On Tuesday, the embassies of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands issued a joint statement expressing ""deep concern"" about the case and urging Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion, AFP says.  The woman was arrested and charged with adultery in August 2013, and the court added the charge of apostasy in February 2014 when she said she was a Christian and not a Muslim, Amnesty said.  The group called for her immediate release.  She is said to be eight months' pregnant."

296,"Hundreds of people in western Bosnia-Hercegovina have held a mock funeral for their own town to protest at the state of the economy and unemployment.  The closure two months ago of the last major company in Drvar left 300 people jobless and sent its unemployment rate to 80% - double the national average.  On Monday, locals lit candles for the soul of the town and put up traditional obituary placards declaring its death.  They accused the authorities of not doing enough to revive Drvar's economy.  The town had 17,000 residents before the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, but it suffered extensive damage and the mainly Bosnian Serb population fled when it eventually fell to the Bosnian Croat army.  The 1995 Dayton peace accord set up two separate entities - a Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and the Bosnian Serb Republic, or Republika Srpska.  Drvar ended up in the former, which many residents - including the 5,000 Serbs who returned to their homes - blamed for its neglected status.  The carpet and paper factories which were damaged during the war were never rebuilt, while other companies were sold by regional authorities to Croatian firms, who laid off all the workers and sold off whatever remained, the residents said.  Local trade union official Mico Rakic said the recent collapse of the local wood mill meant another 300 people had lost their livelihoods. They were owed months of wages and were now relying on donations from their pensioner parents, he added.  ""Drvar's backbone has been broken. This symbolic funeral should serve as an eye-opener for the regional authorities,"" Mr Rakic told Associated Press. ""They must see that these people have nothing to eat.""  Drvar's mayor, Stevica Lukac, appeared at the mock funeral at the local Serbian Orthodox church but urged the crowd not to lose hope.  Bosnia's unemployment rate rose to more than 44% in February, and a recent UN survey found that 75% of young people in the country did not have a job and more than 50% would leave the country given the chance."
297,"Action has been taken against four websites who charged for European health insurance (EHIC) cards that are free from the NHS.  Typically the websites had charged £10 for processing applications that people could have made themselves.  While not an illegal practice, the sites were deemed to have misled customers into believing they were providing an official service.  The cards give UK holidaymakers free or cheap state health care in the EU.  Three of the websites have agreed to stop ""deceptive selling practices"" and two others have stopped trading.  'While it is not unlawful to charge money for a reviewing and forwarding service, traders must be clear about the product or service they are offering, and not trick consumers into parting with money for services they don't want,"" said Heather Clayton of the OFT.  ""People seeking to obtain government funded services such as an EHIC should check carefully that they are using an official government website.""  UK citizens are officially encouraged to get an EHIC card - formerly known as an E111 card - before going on holiday and they are free from the NHS's own website.  In June, the BBC's Money Box programme highlighted the issue of firms trading on the internet and charging for access to free government information or services.  Three websites have now signed an agreement not to mislead their customers about the heath cards.  They are www.ehic.org, www.thejwsgroup.com/ehicservice, and www.ehic.uk.com.  All three websites are currently unavailable.  Another, www.ehiconline.com, has been shut by its domain name registrar after the OFT complained, while the fifth, www.e111-online.com, has shut itself down.  The OFT said it started investigating the websites in March after complaints were made to the Department of Health and to Consumer Direct.  The OFT found that the sites were using a variety of tricks to fool customers into thinking they were paying for an EHIC card via an official website.  The sites, the OFT said, used the EHIC brand, used domain names that made them sound official, and they also failed to mention they were not, in fact, official providers of EHICs."
298,"By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse in France What could be the oldest lunar calendar ever created has been identified on the walls of the famous, prehistoric caves at Lascaux in France.    They were aware of all the rhythms of nature. Their survival depended on them    The interpretation that symbolic paintings, dating back 15,000 years, show the Moon going through its different phases comes from Dr Michael Rappenglueck, of the University of Munich. The German researcher has previously associated patterns left in the caves with familiar stars and constellations. He now says groups of dots and squares painted among representations of bulls, antelope and horses depict the 29-day cycle of the Earth's satellite. With special permission from French authorities, I went into the Lascaux caves with Dr Rappenglueck to inspect the paintings for myself. It was an opportunity most people would never get - to protect the historic site from unnecessary wear and tear, all visitors now tour a mock-up of the caves, the so-called Lascaux II. ""The secret of understanding these caves,"" Dr Rappenglueck told me as we descended into the dark, ""is to understand the people who painted these walls. ""They painted the sky, but not all of it. Just the parts that were specially important to them."" With eyes becoming adjusted to the half-light, I entered the Chamber of the Bulls and stood there in amazement. Anyone who has seen the paintings on the walls can be left in no doubt that they represent some of the greatest works of art every created. The animals were painted on to the walls of the chamber by Cro-magnon man, one of our close relations, 15,000 years ago. He thrived in a temperate valley in the Dordogne while the rest of Europe was held in the grip of an ice age. As I marvelled at the spectacle, Dr Rappenglueck moved ahead of me. ""Here it is,"" he said, as he headed down the passage. He was pointing to a line of dots painted half way up the wall. ""Count them. Count them."" Below a stunning painting of a deer was a row of 13 dots, ending in a square. ""Why 13?"" I asked. ""It's half of the Moon's monthly cycle,"" Dr Rappenglueck said. ""One dot for each day the Moon is in the sky. At the new Moon, when it vanishes from the sky, we see an empty square, perhaps symbolically representing the absent Moon. ""But there's more, further along."" The Munich researcher gestured to me to move along the passageway. Beneath a dappled, brown horse with a dark mane was another row of dots. This time there were more of them. ""There are 29 of them - one for each day of the Moon's 29-day cycle when it runs through its phases in the sky. It was a rhythm of nature that was important to these people."" Dr Rappenglueck looked around at the bulls, antelope and horses painted on the walls with such obvious admiration. ""They were aware of all the rhythms of nature. Their survival depended on them, they were a part of them."" But there is another puzzle. I pointed to the series of dots that curve away from the main row. ""Why do they do that?"" I enquired. ""I think that indicates the time of the new Moon, when it disappears from the sky for several days,"" said Dr Rappenglueck. There is definitely astronomy on the walls of Lascaux. Earlier this year, Dr Rappenglueck identified a series of constellations painted on the wall of a shaft off the main chamber at Lascaux. The tiny pattern of the Pleiades star cluster can also be seen hanging above the shoulder of a bull near the entrance to the main passageway. We will probably never understand completely what Cro-magnon man had in mind when he painted the Lascaux caves. The images of the animals seem obvious but what are we to make of the geometrical shapes and patterns scattered in between these creatures?"
299,"As the UK embarks on building what could be a new generation of nuclear power plants, work continues to decommission the first generation of nuclear power stations at sites including Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia which will take an estimated 90 years to complete.  Eryl Pritchard is at the controls of a robotic arm engaged in the painstaking process of retrieving radioactive resin from a dark, water-filled vault. ""It's not as simple as it looks,"" he says.  Nothing about it looks simple. Radioactivity inside the vault means everything has to be done remotely using tools mounted on the robotic arm.  A bank of monitors show the arm from various angles. A control panel shows a mind-boggling array of levers, switches and buttons.  ""Once you get your head around it, you soon figure out how it works.""  Eryl Pritchard is leader of the Rotary Deployment Arm (RDA) Test Team at Trawsfynydd. While he controls the RDA, a colleague is also watching the monitors to warn of potential hazards.  The umbilical wire connected to the RDA could get wrapped around its mast. There are dead zones in the tank from which the robot could only be recovered manually - a dangerous and time-consuming task.  ""When you're doing delicate operations at the base of a tank, trying to wash underneath, it might take you maybe ten minutes to move the arm all the way around to get the tool into the right orientation. It can get a bit frustrating and stressful, but it's manageable.""  The resin was used as a cleaning agent to remove radioactivity by ion exchange from water used at the site before it could be discharged. Trawsfynydd has more resin waste than other nuclear plants because there were tighter restrictions on any radioactive discharges into the adjacent lake. Britain's other nuclear power stations are on the coast, where tide and current can disperse any radioactivity.  The radioactive resin is classed as Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) and will be placed in a new storage building on site along with other similar waste, from parts of the plant which came into contact with the nuclear fuel.  When the plant was operating, no consideration was given as to how to eventually dismantle and decommission the station. So as a consequence, a lot of operational waste was put in the vaults and is now difficult and dangerous to get at, hence the need for robotic equipment.  Christopher Rogers, Senior Site Engineer is one of only a handful of staff to work at Trawsfynydd on the decommissioning and when it was generating power.  ""The concentration at the time was 'Let's get the megawatts out.' Nowadays we're looking at getting the place finally closed off.  ""The technical challenges are very different. When we were running, our deadlines were a lot, lot tighter - it could be the difference between a couple of hundred thousand pounds a day lost for the company if we didn't get back online again.  ""Now there isn't quite the immediate challenge, obviously we've still got to meet our deadlines, but I think there is a little less pressure than there was in those times. The regulations we have now are a lot tighter and stricter than when we were running"".  Some of the decommissioning work is considered too dangerous or uneconomic to carry out in the current phase of decommissioning.  The two steel pressure vessels which contained the nuclear reactors are staying in the reactor buildings until the radioactivity of the steel has decayed to a safer level.  The twin reactor buildings are having their height lowered to reduce the visual impact of the plant on the surrounding Snowdonia countryside.  From 2026 that is how the site will be left with the ILW still stored on site alongside the reactor buildings.  The final decommissioning at Trawsfynydd and elsewhere depends on finding a safe long term solution for where to deposit the ILW as well as the High Level Waste (HLW) currently stored at Sellafield. This includes the spent nuclear fuel which was removed when the plant closed.  The most likely solution is storage deep underground but a site has yet to be identified. It is hoped that will be established by the 2040s allowing the ILW at Trawsfynydd to be removed.  Final site clearance at Trawsfynydd is not projected to start until 2074 with the land returned to its original state by 2083. It is at that stage that the reactor buildings and the steel pressure vessels will be demolished.  ""The principle (radioactive) isotope is cobalt 60, with a half-life of 5.3 years, so if you leave it for 70 to 100 years, you've got about 0.001% radioactivity left. By capitalising on that radioactive decay, leaving it for that length of time, you can have operators use their hands to dismantle it"", explains Vic Belshaw, Programme Delivery Manager.  Another issue will be what to do with the graphite reactor cores which are still inside the steel pressure vessels at Trawsfynydd.  ""One of the problems the UK has with its commercial nuclear power reactors, with the exception of Sizewell B, is that they all have a large graphite core which is used as a moderator, that's inside the pressure vessel and that's used to slow the neutrons down.  ""There is no real disposal route for the graphite in the UK, the volumes are huge. If you look at the carbon, and the sulphur as well, certain isotopes, the half-lifes are hundreds of thousands of years,"" says Belshaw. While the radioactivity will be very persistent, the graphite is only classed as Low Level Waste (LLW), so will probably not be stored deep underground.  Twenty years after it closed, many hundreds more people are employed at Trawsfynydd than when it was generating power. And it will be many decades before the site can be fully restored.  Could it be done more quickly? Not economically says its owners, Magnox. Earlier decommissioning would involve more expensive remote operations and still carry the risk of exposing workers to radiation.  Others would rather see a quicker solution. ""In an ideal world, the Society would prefer the reactor building to be decommissioned, and the site returned to its original condition, as quickly as possible,"" says the Snowdonia Society, a local charity. ""Obviously the decommissioning needs to be done safely."""
300,"In his annual New Year's message to French ambassadors, Mr Chirac said France's opposition to the war was fully justified by the situation now.  He said the conflict set off upheavals that had yet to be fully played out.  The address is likely to be one of Mr Chirac's last foreign policy speeches before presidential elections in April.  It is thought highly unlikely he will stand for a third term as president.  The invasion had turned the Middle East into the epicentre of global tension at the gates of Europe, Mr Chirac added.  ""As France had foreseen and feared, the war in Iraq has sparked upheavals that have yet to show their full effects,"" he said.  ""This adventure exacerbated the divisions between communities and shook the very integrity of Iraq. It weakened the stability of the whole region where every country is now worried about its security.""  The international community had a duty to try to rebuild confidence in peace in the region, he said, adding that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was crystallising resentment.  Mr Chirac also called on Iran to halt its nuclear enrichment activities, saying this would help promote stability in the region."
301,"Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso said it was time for a ""post-industrial revolution"" which would see Europe slash greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020.  But political as well as environmental concerns should spur change, he noted.  EU vulnerability as an oil importer was thrown into sharp relief this week when Russia's row with Belarus hit supplies.  This is the first step towards a common energy policy, says the BBC's Europe editor Mark Mardell.  There are three central pillars to the proposed integrated EU energy policy.  In addition to the 20% of all EU energy that should come from renewable power by 2020, 10% of vehicle fuel should come from biofuels, said EU energy chief Andris Piebalgs.  The EU wants to make these targets to be binding for the first time, he said.  It also wants to make sure all new power stations are carbon neutral in 13 years - they should be built in such a way that carbon can be captured and buried - as well as ensuring there is a big increase in renewable power like wind and wave energy.  ""We need new policies to face a new reality - policies which maintain Europe's competitiveness, protect our environment and make our energy supplies more secure,"" said Mr Barroso.  ""Europe must lead the world into a new, or maybe one should say post-industrial revolution - the development of a low-carbon economy.""  Without such investment and energy efficiency measures, the EU report predicts that EU energy imports will rise from 50% of consumption to 65% by 2030, requiring increased reliance on potentially unpredictable sources.  Although energy has been a driving factor of the EU, which was born as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, policy has on the whole remained a national issue.  The EU wants to fully open up the existing energy market to enable half a billion citizens to get their electricity or gas from anywhere else in Europe.  Mr Barroso proposed stopping power generation and power supply being owned by the same company, which is very controversial in France and Germany.  ""We have two points of disagreement with the commission, which are the possible eventual abolition of controlled prices and the question of separating asset ownership by integrated operators,"" AFP cited an official source at the French industry ministry as saying.  Meanwhile the commission's proposal to reduce emissions was lambasted by one environmental pressure group.  ""If the EU is serious about tackling climate change it must make far greater cuts in its carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed 20% cut does not demonstrate any intention to stay below the two degree limit,"" Catherine Pearce, the group's international climate co-ordinator, said.  The package of measures will have to be approved by European governments before it can come into force.  EU leaders will debate the commission's proposals at a summit in March."
302,"The 35-year-old ex-England all-rounder was set to quit at the end of the season because of a knee problem but has decided to bow out now.  Irani, who has been plagued by knee problems in recent years, has not played since mid-May and needs surgery.  ""It's a bitter pill to swallow because I'd hoped to get used to the idea of retirement before it came,"" he said.  ""I had a nasty twist and fall against Leicestershire and the knee hasn't recovered since.  ""It's been a tough decision. I have been able to manage the pain in the last few seasons but this latest injury is more acute, it's really bad and I can't continue.  ""If I'd done it 10 years ago I'd have been out of the game sooner. I'm going for an operation in July and that's my lot I'm afraid.""  Essex offered Irani a new two-year contract earlier this year but he rejected it, saying: ""My right-knee condition is so acute that I would be kidding everyone if I accepted it.  ""I'm immensely disappointed but I've loved every minute of my time here.""  Irani, who was made Essex skipper in 2000, made 31 appearances for England's one-day side and played in the 2003 World Cup.  And, after leading the county to the 40-over league title for the last two seasons, he hopes supporters will look back on his time with Essex fondly.  ""I want to make sure that every one of the club's supporters will say that Ronnie Irani gave everything and that he never took a penny without performing,"" he said.  ""Since I gave up bowling in 2003, my batting has really come on but my deteriorating health means that there is no realistic chance of me playing a meaningful role in the 2008 or 2009 seasons."""
303,"Birmingham keeper Maik Taylor was only able to help the Welshman's free-kick over the line as United broke the deadlock in the third minute.  Giggs then latched onto a through ball from Wayne Rooney to tuck in a second after 15 minutes.  Rooney sealed the win, racing through to score with eight minutes left.  The game was watched by a Premiership record attendance of 69,070.  Less than a week after being hit for seven by Liverpool in the FA Cup, a trip to Old Trafford would have been an unappetising prospect for Steve Bruce's relegation-threatened Blues.  Their worst fears were realised inside three minutes when Martin Latka brought Cristiano Ronaldo down 25 yards out.  With Ronaldo and Rooney hovering over the ball, Giggs hit a precise shot that Taylor was only able to tip onto the inside of the post and into the net.  The Blues would have to be credited for the battling spirit they showed afterwards.  While capitulation at the end of their week from hell would have been understandable, they went in search of a way back into the game.  Edwin van der Sar had to react smartly to tip Emile Heskey's header wide and DJ Campbell also tested the United keeper.  But the abiding memory of the first half an hour will have been United's dynamic play with Rooney and Ronaldo in their element as they displayed some devastating footwork.  Rooney's passing and movement was exemplary and, after being fed by Giggs, he hit a perfectly weighted pass to the Welshman who did the simple bit and tucked home the second with 15 minutes on the clock.  Rooney should have got on the scoresheet himself but squandered two clear-cut chances after being put through by Ronaldo.  While never looking in danger of allowing a Birmingham comeback to spoil skipper Gary Neville's 500th appearance for the club, United did lack the zip after the break that had characterised their first-half efforts.  Birmingham enjoyed more possession but despite earning plenty of corners and applying some pressure, they could not find a way back into the game.  Stephen Clemence did fire narrowly wide but his effort, from long distance, was characteristic of the Blues' afternoon.  Then Rooney raced through and was not going to make a third mistake as he fired the ball past Taylor."
304,"A United Nations report accuses Eritrea of planning a car bomb attack at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.  The UN Monitoring Group report on Somalia and Eritrea says the aim was to disrupt the summit in Addis Ababa last January.  Ethiopia accused its neighbour of training rebels to carry out bombings on targets in the city, including an international hotel.  Eritrea has repeatedly denied any involvement in such a plot.  ""We say this is totally a fabrication and the report is absurd. We have never been involved in any acts of terrorism,"" said the Eritrean ambassador to the UN, Araya Desta, in a radio interview with the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.  The report states that Asmara's spies are active in Uganda, South Sudan, Kenya and Somalia, posing a threat to regional peace and security.  The UN interprets the plot as representing a shift in tactics by the Eritrean intelligence services.  ""Whereas Eritrean support to foreign armed opposition groups has in the past been limited to conventional military operations, the plot to disrupt the African Union summit in Addis Ababa in January 2011, which envisaged mass casualty attacks against civilian targets and the strategic use of explosives to create a climate of fear, represents a qualitative shift in Eritrean tactics,"" said the report.  It outlines the details of the plan: to attack the AU headquarters with a car bomb as African leaders took breaks, to blow up Africa's largest market to ""kill many people"", and attack the area between the prime minister's office and the Sheraton Hotel, where most heads of state stay during AU summits."
305,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. A huge fire has destroyed the historic Grand Pier at Weston-super-Mare. Dozens of firefighters fought to tackle the blaze which took hold of the partly wooden pier in the North Somerset seaside resort at about 0700 BST. No-one was injured in the fire, which firefighters said started in an area containing deep fat fryers. Black smoke was visible more than 10 miles away. The owners, who have recently bought and refurbished the pier, were said to be ""absolutely devastated"". The flames have obliterated the pier's many serving hatches, bars and games booths leaving its 100 employees facing an uncertain future. A statement is due to be made later by the pier's joint owner Kerry Michael regarding what will happen to their jobs. The fire broke out at the foot of the West Tower. Photo: Penny Broomhall    Dee Williams, deputy manager of the Grand Atlantic Hotel, which lies 200 yards from the pier, described the fire as ""an inferno"" and heard loud bangs which she believed to be fireworks left over from a recent display. ""It is part of our identity and would really affect trade if we were to lose it,"" she said. Jacquie Whelan, owner of Sunfold Hotel on Beach Road, said it was a ""horrendous"" sight, with massive red flames, hundreds of feet in the air, all over the pier. ""[It looked] like a huge bonfire,"" she said. Police have placed a cordon around the pier and beach and advised people to avoid the area. The quarter-of-a-mile-long pier, which attracts thousands of visitors a year, reopened in April after a massive revamp. It first opened in 1904 and was later bought by the Brenner family who sold it earlier this year in a multi-million pound deal to brother and sister Michelle and Kerry Michael. Mr Michael is said to be on his way home from holiday in Spain. The Grand Pier: Then and now    ""He had only just got there but has cut it short to come back,"" said his spokesman Nigel Heath. ""He is absolutely devastated. Mr Michael bought the pier in February and spent around £1m - he's installed a go-kart track, a climbing wall and fitted a bar for the first time. ""His whole plan was to turn it into a premier tourist attraction, in fact he already had. ""He had a huge personal involvement in the project and was totally committed to it."" Avon Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was well-developed by the time crews arrived and officers had to battle against ""intense radiated heat"". Chief fire officer Kevin Pearson said: ""Indications are that there were some deep fat fryers in the area where we believe the fire first started. ""We're fairly clear about where we think the fire first started and obviously our investigations will concentrate on that area."" The foundations of the structure, which is supported by iron girders, were said to be sound and not at risk of collapse. Rod Brenner, who owned the pier until six months ago when he sold it to the current owners, said: ""I think that what has happened is, fortunately it had a very thick hardwood floor, and I think that has held, from what I can see here. ""The entire pavilion has gone admittedly, and it'll be obviously a huge project to rebuild it, which will take a considerable amount of time. ""I mean, when it burnt down last time, in 1930, it took three years and they probably moved a bit quicker then than we do nowadays."" Christopher Donkin, manager of Seaquarium aquarium in Marine Parade, some 500 yards from the pier, was alerted to the fire by a colleague as he drove to work. He said: ""Fortunately, we're not in danger, no other properties are in any other danger. ""The fire brigade have put a wall of water along the walkway between the seafront and the end of the pier. ""When I first saw the fire, to be honest my first thoughts were for the livelihoods of people who work here. ""It's Weston's number one attraction. It's full of childhood memories. ""All those people's livelihoods and businesses - where will they go?"" Tory MP for Weston-super-Mare John Penrose said he was ""shocked and dismayed"" by the scenes at the Grand Pier. ""The Grand Pier is one of the icons of Weston's seafront,"" he said. ""Anybody who has ever visited the town or lives here permanently has probably strolled along the boardwalk, eating candyfloss, to play on the amusements at the far end. ""Kerry and Michelle Michael have been investing huge amounts of their own time and money into regenerating the pier. This is a tragedy for the town as a whole and for them in particular. ""The only piece of good news is that there are no reports of casualties. At least there is something to be thankful for."" Deputy leader of North Somerset Council Elfan Ap Rees said: ""The structure going out of the pavilion is intact, the main structure underneath looks reasonably intact. ""I am absolutely convinced that the owners of the pier, who are local Weston people born and bred, will make every effort to see the Grand Pier rise again and we will do what we can to support that."""
306,"Tameside Council has granted planning permission for the store, which is expected to open in Ashton-under-Lyne in October, creating about 500 jobs.  Councillor Kieran Quinn, from Tameside Council, said it was likely to attract other businesses to the area.  Ikea failed twice to get permission to build a store in Stockport.  The company had appealed to the high court after Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott twice blocked the development, but the appeal was rejected in February last year.  The Ashton-under-Lyne store is planned to be built on the corner of Wellington Road and Oldham Road.  Mr Quinn,Tameside Council's executive member for jobs and new investment, said: ""It's brilliant news for Greater Manchester.  ""Not only are we bringing an iconic company into the area, we are also bringing with it 500 new jobs.  ""People look to towns where Ikea is and we believe that other new businesses will now look to Tameside.""  Scott Cordrey, Ikea's UK property manager, said: ""We're happy to have obtained such a good site in Ashton and glad that the plans have been approved.  ""It's fantastic news for Ikea and all our customers in Greater Manchester."""
307,"The first regular passenger train service between the mainline and a Dorset seaside resort has been reconnected after four decades.  The original rail line from Swanage to Wareham was closed by British Rail and ripped up in seven weeks in 1972.  Volunteers rebuilt the 5.5-mile (8.8km) stretch from Swanage to Norden over 30 years and have been running it as a tourist attraction since the 1990s.  The first timetabled train ran along the full 10-mile (16km) route earlier.  Bob Richards, who signalled the last British Rail train from Swanage to Wareham 45 years ago, was one of dozens of people to wave off the maroon diesel train.  He said: ""To see it return after all these years is amazing - absolutely incredible.""  It marks the start of a two-year trial using upgraded 1960s diesel trains on the line, after work was completed on the section of the track from Norden to Wareham.  Swanage Railway will operate four trains a day in each direction between Wareham, Corfe Castle and Swanage, on 60 selected days throughout the summer.  The rail firm's chairman Trevor Parsons said several generations of volunteers had worked to see this ""historic"" day.  Founder volunteer Peter Frost, who rode on the last British Rail train between the two Purbeck towns, was 13 when the original line closed.  He was among invited guests who travelled on the first trial service which departed Swanage at 10:23 BST and described it as a ""poignant moment"".  ""It was very sad to watch the line being run down, closed and then quickly demolished because I grew up with the branch line during the 1960s, with its station staff and train crews being extended members of my family,"" he said.  After reaching Wareham, he added: ""It's difficult to put into words, it's one those amazing days in your life. We've lost a lot of friends over the past 45 years... but it's great we've made it.  ""[Now we want to] deliver an efficient and regular service and make this a success.""  Fellow passenger Billy Johnson, 29, who has lived in Swanage all of his life and works on the railway, said: ""Hopefully it will bring more people to the town, to the shops and railway itself, so it should be a good thing for us.""  Rosemarie Cobb added: ""I used to watch the trains go by from the back of my grandparents' garden and they used to take me and my sister down to Swanage from Poole.  ""I have very happy memories, today is very nostalgic for me. They've had to fight for this and worked so hard. It's a wonderful achievement.""  A new £500,000 level crossing was installed as part of the £5.5m investment by the railway's stakeholders - including Purbeck District Council, Dorset County Council and BP - and a £1.8m grant from the government's Coastal Communities Fund.  The work also included the replacement of 1,200 wooden sleepers with concrete ones.  Timetabled trials were originally expected to begin in 2015 but faced delays.  Issues including upgrade works on its diesel trains, ownership of the rail line and nearby hibernating animals."
308,"A Scottish marine services firm has secured a contract to operate one of the busiest ferries across the Thames.  Briggs Marine has won the right to take over the Woolwich Ferry from current operator Serco, starting next April.  Briggs, based at Burntisland in Fife, is expanding into public passenger services.  The contract is worth about £50m over seven years. It is let by Transport for London, with Briggs taking over running of the existing assets.  The Woolwich Ferry currently has three vessels, carrying about 20,000 vehicles and 50,000 passengers each week.  Briggs already employs 500 people with a recent annual turnover of about £40m, operating contract marine services, but this is the first long-term public ferry contract it has won, which is part of what the Fife firms says has been a long-term plan.  Collieson Briggs, managing director, said the contract was ""testament to the specialist skills and expertise that we possess and continue to develop"".  He added: ""We are looking forward to working closely with London River Services and the Woolwich Ferry's existing team both to deliver a seamless transition and also to continue to improve on the safety, reliability and efficiency of this vital transport link."""
309,"Michael Portillo is to chair a £55m scheme to help arts organisations develop long-term funding plans.  About 50 organisations are expected to benefit from the grants, which will start at £500,000.  Groups will be able to bid for grants of up to £5m, but will be expected to raise double that amount through the private sector.  The Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will fund the scheme.  The money will be available to arts organisations across the UK, and it is hoped applications can begin to be submitted in early September.  The £55 million is part of a £100 million pledge to support philanthropy.  The funds will be given as an endowment, with the interest used to pay the groups' running costs.  Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who announced the plans during a speech at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, said: ""World class cultural organisations should have world class financial resilience.  ""Michael Portillo is passionate about culture and will bring real wisdom to a process that will start a much-needed change in our approach to cultural fundraising.""  Alan Davey, Chief Executive of Arts Council England, said: ""Arts and heritage endowments will provide a range of opportunities for arts and cultural organisations to build their skills and capacity to fundraise, to match-fund using new ideas and to invest for their long-term health and creativity.""  In December 2010, Mr Hunt announced an £80 million fund to help increase philanthropy. This was made up of £50 million from Arts Council England and £30 million from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).  Mr Hunt announced on Monday that this would be boosted by an additional £20 million Heritage Lottery Fund contribution.  Shadow Culture Secretary Ivan Lewis, said: ""The test of its success will be whether public funding triggers new private giving, which would not otherwise have been raised, and supports arts organisations which currently receive little or no philanthropic support to develop this source of funding.  ""By Mr Hunt's own admission, this fund will do nothing to help organisations currently scaling down activities and struggling to survive as a result of the Conservative-led government's disproportionate cuts to the arts."""
310,"Customs officers have carried out spot checks at petrol stations, supermarkets and car parks to catch motorists using reduced-duty fuels.  In some areas one in five tanks in vehicles stopped were found to contain red diesel, an agricultural fuel only intended for off-road farming vehicles.  Red diesel only costs about 35p a litre - about 65p less than ordinary fuels.  So far this year, more than 1,700 private cars have been found running on the illegal fuel.  Red diesel works in the same way as normal diesel but, because it is taxed at a lower rate, it is only to be used in agricultural vehicles.  It is chemically marked with a red dye to make it more identifiable.  With normal diesel prices soaring, Revenue and Customs fear that drivers using the fuel illegally are costing UK taxpayers £350m each year.  A Revenue and Customs spokeswoman said: ""Using red diesel may seem an attractive option, but the price difference is there for a reason.  ""People who use the illegal fuel are abusing the tax system. They cheat the whole country out of vital funds for public services.""  The spokeswoman explained that a scale of penalty charges is in place to punish those who use illegal fuels.  For example, she said a person who used £27 of red diesel could be charged a £500 penalty."
311,"The fossilised contents of its lower intestine show the long-necked marine reptile had a fondness for clams and snails - food items from the sea floor.  Plesiosaurs existed in dinosaur times and were thought to be hunters of fish, squid and other free-swimming prey.  But a research team tells Science magazine that the discovery suggests plesiosaur diets were far more varied.  ""Traditionally, from the day these creatures were first found, it was quite reasonably assumed plesiosaurs were fish and squid eaters,"" said team member Dr Steve Wroe, from the University of Sydney, Australia.  The team actually examined the fossilised remains of two elasmosaurids, the most extreme form of plesiosaur that had necks longer than their bodies and tails combined.  They were both unearthed in Queensland, which 100-110 million years ago would have been covered by a sea.  When they were alive, the plesiosaurs would have been 5-6m in length and about a tonne in weight.  One of the specimens contained a bromalite, a fossilised mass of food waste.  ""The indigestible parts of the prey were compacted together, just prior to being expelled, and the result was a solid lump of digested food composed entirely of broken shells from bottom living animals,"" explained Colin McHenry, from the University of Newcastle.  The clue to answer, the team says, came in the form of large polished pebbles found within the stomach region. Both specimens had them.  Explained Dr Wroe: ""The role of these gastroliths, or stomach stones, has been an area of contention for many years.  ""In marine animals, there's certainly a theoretical advantage with respect to buoyancy control or ballast; but with these plesisaours, these stones would have been very useful for crushing up clam shells and snail shells."""
312,"Robert Ashman, 52, had denied trying to kill the Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham, Nigel Jones, on 28 January 2000.  Mr Jones's assistant, local councillor Andrew Pennington, died in the attack at the MP's weekly constituency surgery after being stabbed six times.  Ashman had previously admitted the manslaughter of Mr Pennington on the grounds of diminished responsibility.  On Thursday a jury of seven men and four women at Bristol Crown Court deliberated for less than six hours before finding Ashman guilty of the attempted murder of Mr Jones.  Mrs Justice Heather Hallett said: ""I am very conscious as to public safety.  ""I must be allowed to allow doctors at Broadmoor the chance to look at him again.  ""The protection of the public will be utmost in my mind. I still feel that my duty is first and foremost to the public when one sees what Robert Ashman did.""  Earlier in the four-day hearing they had been told how Ashman, a regular visitor to Mr Jones's surgeries, had taken his father's sword with him on the day of the attack.  After asking Mr Jones to look at a letter for him, he pulled out the three-foot long weapon and lunged at the MP with it.  Mr Jones suffered serious injuries to his hands as he tried to fend off the man.  When the MP escaped and tried to run for help, Ashman turned on 39-year-old Mr Pennington, killing him.  Mr Pennington was posthumously awarded the George Medal for bravery for saving Nigel Jones's life.  Speaking after the verdict was announced, Mr Jones said: ""It is so good to get closure on this thing and get back to normal.  ""It is good that after more than three years my side of the horrible events have been vindicated by a jury and I can try and forget the whole affair.  ""But of course the loss of my friend Andrew Pennington will be with me forever."""
313,"A Dr Martens shoe factory in Northamptonshire is to expand to meet increased demand for English-made boots.  The company in Wollaston relaunched its vintage-look boot seven years ago, which has become increasingly popular.  It is now taking on 12 new members of staff and four apprentices.  Factory manager Brian Clayton said: ""We are looking at relocating certain machinery to another location in the village of Wollaston.""  Most of the company's shoes are made in the Far East, but it has found a market for English-made shoes.  ""It is the concept of the traditional made in England tradesman behind the product,"" said Mr Clayton. ""The methods and the ideology behind that is strong.""  Dr Martens is looking for skilled employees and also wants nurture a new generation of shoe makers.  The company said it was finding it difficult to find skilled staff as the industry changes.  Mr Clayton said: ""We have to train youngsters for the next generation of shoemaking, which is vital to the success of this business."""
314,"The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport, Gillian Merron, will unveil a plaque at Eldon Square Bus Station, Newcastle, on Tuesday.  Newcastle City Council said the new station will offer passengers a modern, comfortable waiting area with automatic doors and air conditioning.  The new station is on Prudhoe Street and replaces the underground concourse off Percy Street.  As well as an extensive CCTV camera network and regular security patrols, the station also boasts artwork by glass artist Dan Savage.  He has produced 19 glass bay screens, screen-printed with enamels in blue, deep pink and black.  The designs are based on the hustle and bustle of a busy city.  Council leader John Shipley said: ""The new bus station will provide a first-class waiting area for passengers, greatly improving the comfort and convenience of travelling by bus."""
315,"Guinea have now been formally banned from all international football activities due to government interference in the sport.  World governing body Fifa acted after the West African country ignored several deadlines to reinstate the national football association executive committee fired in January.  Sports minister Abdelkader Sangare took the action after Guinea had been held at home by Togo and Malawi in qualifying matches for the 2002 African Nations Cup and World Cup competitions.  Guinea were due to play the Togolese again on Sunday in Lome but Confederation of African Football spokesman Viken Djizmedjian confirmed the fixture had been cancelled.  ""The matches Guinea played against Uganda, Senegal and Togo in Group 5 of the African Nations Cup have been declared null and void,"" the Cairo-based official said.  Similar action is likely in the World Cup where Guinea were lying second in Group E behind South Africa. It had been hoped Guinea could catch up after missing their game in South Africa last weekend in the fifth round of qualifying matches. Guinea beat Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso before the 1-1 draw with Malawi that triggered government intervention with Sangare saying ""Guinea was a sovereign state that would not be dictated to by Fifa"". Fifa's original suspension came on the eve of the Under-17 Cup of Nations final which Guinea had qualified for, but subsequently missed and therefore also lost out on a place at the Under-17 World Cup in Trinidad later this year. After sacking the executive, the minister ordered fresh government-backed elections that saw employers' federation boss Mamadou Sylla replace Salifou Camara as chairman. While officials from each region of Guinea voted, Fifa refused to accept the results because only the sacked executive had the authority to organise elections. It is not the first time Guinean politicians have entered the football arena - late president Sekou Toure jailed players from the Hafia club after they surrendered a three-goal lead in the 1976 African Champions Cup final."
316,"Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah was killed in a drive-by shooting in the southern Dora district of the capital, an interior ministry spokesman said.  The attack came as efforts began to register voters for January's polls.  Iraq's President Ghazi Yawer has meanwhile spoken out against plans for an imminent assault on the rebel stronghold of Falluja.  Mr Yawer told a Kuwaiti newspaper he completely disagreed ""with those who believe there is a need for a military solution"" in the city, which the US accuses of hosting foreign fighters loyal to alleged al-Qaeda militant, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.  Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi warned on Sunday that time was running out for negotiations to stave off a US assault on Falluja.  President Yawer, a Sunni with a largely symbolic role in government, also criticised neighbouring Iran for fomenting strife in southern Iraq.  The car carrying Baghdad's deputy governor was rammed by attackers as it went past a mosque, the BBC's Alastair Leithead reports.  The attack comes at the start of a six-week period during which Iraqis wanting to vote or run for election have to register in 550 centres across the country.  Our correspondent says the centres have been set up in places where Iraqis receive food rations in the hope that people will not feel threatened, and to reduce the risk of targeted attacks.  But militant groups have made threats against those working on the elections, he adds.  Fears of further violence have led to a boost in US troop levels.  The departure of certain units from the area has been delayed while a 3,700-strong National Guard unit has been stationed in the Iraqi capital.  The US now has around 142,000 troops in Iraq.  Fighting in Ramadi - like Falluja, a flashpoint dominated by Sunni insurgent groups - has claimed at least six lives, according to hospital officials quoted by Agence France Presse.  A freelance Iraqi cameraman, Dhia Najim, who worked for several Western news agencies, was killed while filming fighting between US troops and insurgents in the city.  At least seven Iraqis were killed in the city on Sunday, along with at least one US marine.  US troops around Ramadi are said to number around 2,000, doubling their earlier deployment.  Clashes have also continued in Falluja and Tikrit.  US troops have kept their bombardment of Falluja while a rocket attack on Sunday in Tikrit killed at least 15 civilians and wounded eight.  Reports suggest insurgents fired two rockets at an American base, but one missed and hit a hotel housing workers.  A British soldier has meanwhile been found dead at a military base in the southern city of Basra, but the death did not appear to be related to combat, the UK said on Sunday."
317,"The 41-year-old suspect, identified as Armin M, is alleged to have killed the 43-year-old victim in March 2001 in the town of Rotenburg in central Germany, after meeting him through the site.  He then carved up and froze portions of the man's flesh, later eating some of it, prosecutors allege.  The crime was apparently carried out with the victim's full consent, however state prosecutor Hans-Manfred Jung told French news agency AFP that the victim's supposed ""death wish"" did not change the fact that the killer had wanted to commit murder.  The suspect's arrest in December last year caused a sensation in Germany, as the country's tabloids competed to report the most grisly details of the case.  The suspect and victim met in early 2001, after Armin M is said to have posted a personal ad on several websites and in chatrooms asking for ""young, well-built men aged 18 to 30 to slaughter"", the German daily newspaper Bild reported at the time of his arrest.  The victim was a 43-year-old Berlin computer technician who had sold his car, written a will and taken the day off work to sort out what he called a ""personal"" matter.  He then went to Armin M's home, where the pair reportedly agreed to cut off his penis.  The victim was then allegedly stabbed to death - still apparently with his approval - and cut into pieces.  The whole incident was filmed on videotape, and prosecutors say that the whole crime was committed for the purpose of sexual enjoyment.  Authorities were tipped off by internet surfers who found the requests on various sites.  Mr Jung said there was no evidence that Armin M had been involved in further cases, however several people with whom he had been in contact on the internet are still under investigation.  A date for the trial has yet to be set."
318,"Former Labour MP David Chaytor has pleaded guilty to three charges relating to his expenses claims.  Chaytor, 61, the former MP for Bury North, was charged with false accounting totalling just over £20,000.  He claimed rent for his own flat in London and rent for a house in Bury, which was owned by his mother.  He would have been the first Parliamentarian to stand trial over his expenses but changed his plea before it was due to start on Monday.  Chaytor stood down as an MP at the general election - having been barred by Labour from standing for them again.  He was granted unconditional bail and will be sentenced on 7 January at Southwark Crown Court. He faces a maximum seven years in jail but is likely to receive a more lenient sentence because of his guilty plea.  Two other former MPs, one current MP and two members of the House of Lords are due to face separate trials over their expenses claims.  Chaytor had claimed £12,925 between 2005 and 2006 for renting a flat in Regency Street, near Westminster, which he owned - producing a fake tenancy agreement which said he was paying £1,175 a month rent.  He also falsely claimed £5,425 between 2007 and 2008 for renting a home in Castle Street, Bury, which was owned by his mother. He admitted he had not paid his mother, who had moved into a home because of illness. Under Commons rules he was not allowed to rent from a family member.  A third charge related to falsely charging £1,950 for IT support services in May 2006. The charge said that he supplied two invoices from a man named Paul France for his professional services ""when in fact the services had not been provided or charged for"". However in that case, Chaytor had not received the money claimed.  He had denied the charges but appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday to change his plea, having failed in a court bid to argue that expenses cases should be heard by Parliament, not the courts.  Chaytor's QC James Sturman told the judge, Mr Justice Saunders that £13,000 had already been repaid: ""There are many misconceptions about the case which we will wish to put right on January 7.  ""Obviously he accepts this is a serious matter. There is no loss to the public purse. Any sums claimed have been, or will be, repaid.""  He said there had so far been ""a total failure to reflect that his case reflects appropriate claims gone about in the wrong way"".  Asked for his reaction to the verdict, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ""We take seriously any breaches of rules on expenses. It's for the court to reach its judgement in that case.""  He added: ""It is very important that we do all we can, as we have done in Parliament, to clean up our expenses system.""  Chaytor was mobbed by photographers as he left the court with his legal team before getting into a taxi. He did not comment.  Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Simon Clements, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""David Chaytor has admitted his dishonesty and will now face the consequences of his actions.  ""No-one, no matter what their position, should be allowed to take money they are not entitled to.  ""By his actions David Chaytor has abused the trust placed in him by the public.  ""I would remind everyone that today is about David Chaytor alone.  ""Nothing that happened today should reflect on any defendant in any other case.""  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says that MPs hope Chaytor's conviction might allow public feeling on expenses finally to cool off.  Chaytor, who was elected during Labour's 1997 landslide victory, had spent his 13 years in the Commons on the back benches.  He was suspended by the Labour Party and barred from standing for them again after stories about his expenses claims emerged when the Daily Telegraph published hundreds of claims made by MPs over several years.  At the time he apologised for what he called accounting errors and referred himself to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner for investigation.  But after a lengthy police inquiry the Crown Prosecution Service announced in February he would face criminal charges."
319,"China is on course to overtake the US in scientific output possibly as soon as 2013 - far earlier than expected.  That is the conclusion of a major new study by the Royal Society, the UK's national science academy.  The country that invented the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing is set for a globally important comeback.  An analysis of published research - one of the key measures of scientific effort - reveals an ""especially striking"" rise by Chinese science.  The study, Knowledge, Networks and Nations, charts the challenge to the traditional dominance of the United States, Europe and Japan.  The figures are based on the papers published in recognised international journals listed by the Scopus service of the publishers Elsevier.  In 1996, the first year of the analysis, the US published 292,513 papers - more than 10 times China's 25,474.  By 2008, the US total had increased very slightly to 316,317 while China's had surged more than seven-fold to 184,080.  Previous estimates for the rate of expansion of Chinese science had suggested that China might overtake the US sometime after 2020.  But this study shows that China, after displacing the UK as the world's second leading producer of research, could go on to overtake America in as little as two years' time.  ""Projections vary, but a simple linear interpretation of Elsevier's publishing data suggests that this could take place as early as 2013,"" it says.  Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, chair of the report, said he was ""not surprised"" by this increase because of China's massive boost to investment in R&D.  Chinese spending has grown by 20% per year since 1999, now reaching over $100bn, and as many as 1.5 million science and engineering students graduated from Chinese universities in 2006.  ""I think this is positive, of great benefit, though some might see it as a threat and it does serve as a wake-up call for us not to become complacent.""  The report stresses that American research output will not decline in absolute terms and raises the possibility of countries like Japan and France rising to meet the Chinese challenge.  ""But the potential for China to match American output in terms of sheer numbers in the near to medium term is clear.""  The authors describe ""dramatic"" changes in the global scientific landscape and warn that this has implications for a nation's competitiveness.  According to the report, ""The scientific league tables are not just about prestige - they are a barometer of a country's ability to compete on the world stage"".  Along with the growth of the Chinese economy, this is yet another indicator of China's extraordinarily rapid rise as a global force.  However the report points out that a growing volume of research publications does not necessarily mean in increase in quality.  One key indicator of the value of any research is the number of times it is quoted by other scientists in their work.  Although China has risen in the ""citation"" rankings, its performance on this measure lags behind its investment and publication rate.  ""It will take some time for the absolute output of emerging nations to challenge the rate at which this research is referenced by the international scientific community.""  The UK's scientific papers are still the second most-cited in the world, after the US.  Dr Cong Cao, associate professor at Nottingham University's School of Contemporary Chinese Studies, agrees with the assessment that the quantity of China's science is yet not matched by its quality.  A sociologist originally from Shanghai, Dr Cao told the BBC: ""There are many millions of graduates but they are mandated to publish so the numbers are high.  ""It will take many years for some of the research to catch up to Western standards.""  As to China's motivation, Dr Cao believes that there is a determination not to be dependent on foreign know-how - and to reclaim the country's historic role as a global leader in technology."
320,"A plea for emergency cash to keep the National Football Museum open has been rejected by the government.  Preston's Labour MP Mark Hendrick made the appeal for a rescue package during a debate on the museum on Wednesday.  Tourism minister Kim Howells refused to include the ailing attraction - based in Preston - in a state-funded scheme for free entry to museums.  Mr Hendrick said it would be a ""slap in the face for Preston"" - recently awarded city status - if the museum had to move to survive.  He told the Westminster Hall debate the museum, which houses UK and world football memorabilia, is backed by top names like Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Alex Ferguson.  It is presently housed at Deepdale, home of Preston North End, who were first winners of the league and are still based at the UK's oldest ground.  Mr Howells said the Government was concerned to secure the future of the museum, which was paid for with a £9.5m lottery grant in 2001.  However, he said it had proved ""a great disappointment"" - attracting less than half its target of 80,000 visitors in the first year.  Although it holds the ""world's most important collection of football memorabilia"", the museum does not qualify for the museums budget, because he said free entry will not turn its fortunes around.  The Department of Culture Media and Sport has asked the Football Foundation to consider providing more help, Mr Howells said.  ""There was a good historical reason to locate it in Preston,"" said Mr Howells.  ""But we must recognise that location has played a part in the museum's financial difficulties.  ""The museum and those who seek to assist it must look imaginatively at alternative sources of funding."""
321,"Performances of music and singing and dance have been a feature of the iconic London site for many years.  Operatic star Lesley Garrett joined jugglers, singers, magicians and string quartets in a site protest on Thursday.  Market owners Capco say there are no plans to stop acts but there are issues over performances clashing and noise.  Evelyn Anderson, an opera singer and cellist, who represents the buskers, said Capco wants to cut 50% of their time slots, which would destroy the livelihoods of many entertainers.  She said she thought the hidden agenda was ultimately to do away with the buskers completely so the shopping sites could be offered to upmarket clients.  Capco said the decrease in performance slots related only to the north and south halls in the market building, which were just one part of street performance in the area.  ""The significant areas for complaint that are causing considerable disruption to the Covent Garden community include overlapping performances and repetitive use of material,"" Bev Churchil, Covent Garden's brand director, said.  ""We are proposing to reduce the amount of performance time so that performances do not overlap and create a 'sound clash'.  ""This will draw more people to the individual performances rather than dividing the audience between two simultaneous acts.  ""We are also introducing regular breaks so that there are parts of the day where the wider community can have a break from music.  ""We support street performance in the area and see it as a fundamental part of the history and the future of Covent Garden."""
322,"Wigan Athletic reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their 81-year history with a deserved victory over Championship side Millwall at Wembley in a match marred by serious crowd violence.  Shaun Maloney's first-half goal put Roberto Martinez's Premier League side on their way and Callum McManaman secured a meeting with Chelsea or Manchester City next month when he finished off a flowing move 12 minutes from time.  Sadly, however, the occasion was scarred in the closing stages as prolonged fighting broke out in several areas of Millwall's allocated end.  It was an unsavoury conclusion to a game in which the south London side battled gamely but could never match the class of Wigan, who ran out winners with something to spare.  Martinez can now focus his concentration on securing top-flight safety but this was a day of misery for Millwall on the pitch and a shameful one off it as an increasingly tense atmosphere built up throughout the second half before trouble flared.  Many Millwall fans were quick to condemn their own supporters but the fighting took some time to bring under control and is another blot on the club's reputation.  Police using batons moved in to try to stem the violence but some were forced to beat a retreat in clashes with supporters and it took some time to restore a measure of control.  Some fans sustained bloodied facial injuries and one young female supporter was captured on camera in tears as trouble raged around her.  Wigan's supporters, in contrast, were left to celebrate another landmark in the remarkable rise of a club that only joined the Football League in 1978.  This achievement, however, will be overshadowed by what was witnessed in the stands as Millwall's supporters turned on each other once their defeat became a certainty.  For McManaman, though, it was a far happier afternoon.  Less than a month ago he was vilified for his horror challenge on Newcastle United's Massadio Haidara, but against Millwall he caught the eye for all the right reasons.  As expected, given the status of the two clubs, there were vast swathes of empty spaces around Wembley in a crowd of 62,335. It was, however, still a lively atmosphere as the two teams came out.  There had been talk of Wigan chairman Dave Whelan leading the team out but as this was a semi-final and no formal request had been made to the FA, he took his place high in the Wembley stands.  Wigan demonstrated the greater quality in scrappy opening phases and it made the difference when they took the lead. Arouna Kone dropped deep to take the ball on his chest before avoiding the attentions of Millwall's defenders and delivering a perfect cross for Maloney to send a sliding, volleyed finish past David Forde.  The Millwall keeper had distinguished himself with an early save from McManaman and showed great athleticism to turn away an effort from Jordi Gomez following more good work by the dangerous Kone.  The skilful McManaman and Maloney had been posing problems for the Lions and so it proved again in the moments after the restart. McManaman slalomed his way in from the left flank, beating Millwall defenders, but his attempted finish from an acute angle was over-ambitious and flew off target.  Martinez made his first change on the hour as Jean Beausejour was replaced by James McArthur as Millwall finally started to make some headway via set pieces and the aerial power of captain Danny Shittu.  The shift in emphasis prompted Jackett to make a change of his own after 67 minutes, sending on experienced striker Rob Hulse for Jack Smith.  The Latics always held the upper hand and their return to Wembley was confirmed when Kone broke out of defence and Gomez played in McManaman, who rounded Forde to score.

323,"Average-priced homes in 548 out of 597 main UK postal towns were beyond the means of people on average salaries, according to the study.  The problem of affordability is most acute in the south of England, where house prices have outpaced earnings.  Toughest of all is Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire, where a home costs 18 times the average income.  At the other end of the scale, Lochgelly in Scotland is the most affordable town, with property costing just three times the average salary.  In England, Nelson in the North West is the most affordable location for first-time buyers, with property costing 3.24 times the average salary.  Halifax defined a town as unaffordable for first-time buyers if the average property price was more than 4.37 times the average salary.  Using this method, Halifax found that 95% of towns in the South East, East Anglia and the South West were unaffordable for first-time buyers.  But in Scotland and Northern Ireland, just 19% and 25% of towns respectively were deemed unaffordable.  Halifax chief economist Martin Ellis said that first-time buyer numbers are at their lowest level since 1981.  ""Affordability has become a serious issue, making it very difficult for those looking to get onto the housing ladder for the first time.""  However, Mr Ellis added that the slowdown in the housing market in recent months offered fresh hope to first-time buyers.  ""We expect the situation to improve somewhat as earnings growth outstrips house price growth over the next few years.""  ""This will make it easier for first-time buyers, thereby boosting the number from its current historically very low level.""  Gerrards Cross estate agent Michael Day, said: ""People want to move somewhere a little leafier, which have good schools and transport links.  Mr Day, the managing director of Integra Property Services, said: ""They say three factors sell a house: location, location, location. Gerrards Cross has all of them.""  But one Scottish mortgage consultant said he was ""mystified"" as to why Lochgelly was the cheapest town.  James Marman at Delmor Estate Agents, in nearby Cowdenbeath, said about 9,000 people lived in Lochgelly, with three primary schools, one secondary school, a loch and golf course.  He said: ""There is a real mixture of people - from first time buyers to people who have moved to the area to retire - and those who have lived there for their entire life.""  On average, a three-bedroom terraced house would cost around £75, 000 in Lochgelly, he said.  By contrast a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Gerrards Cross would cost about £470,000, according to Rightmove property website."
324,"The author shares the £10,000 prize money with translator Daniel Hahn.  The prize celebrates a novel that has been translated into English and published in the UK in past year.  Boyd Tonkin, judge and literary editor of The Independent, called it ""a delightful, moving and revealing novel about modern Africa"".  ""It is remarkable for its witty originality and profound humanity, and blessed by a captivating translation from the Portuguese by Daniel Hahn,"" said Mr Tonkin.  Agualusa and Hahn celebrated their success at a ceremony at London's National Portrait Gallery on Tuesday.

325,"Rotherham United manager Neil Warnock has left the club after securing their Championship status this season.  Warnock, 67, was appointed manager until the end of the season in February after Neil Redfearn was sacked.  The Millers were in the relegation zone when Warnock arrived but they finished in 21st place.  A club statement read: ""We would like to place on record our thanks to Neil and his support staff for the 16 games that they led the team for.""  Rotherham have held talks with Warnock over the past fortnight, but the former Sheffield United boss, along with assistant manager Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson have all departed.  The Millers won six and drew six of their 16 league games under Warnock - including an 11-game unbeaten run - which saw them finish nine points clear of the relegation zone.  The club have said they will appoint a new manager - their fourth in eight months - in due course."
326,"A bomb has exploded at a north London postal sorting office. It is the second such attack in three weeks and has been linked to the Real IRA. A bomb has exploded at a north London postal sorting office. It is the second such attack in three weeks and has been linked to the Real IRA. One passer-by - a man in his 20s - was slightly injured in the explosion in Hendon at 0153 BST. After the attack, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, told reporters dissident republicans from Northern Ireland may be planning a bombing campaign ahead of the general election. We will be doing everything possible to secure the safety of those taking part in the election and the general public   Mr Fry said police had contingency plans for dealing with the ""major challenge"" of a terror campaign ahead of the election, which is expected to be called within days. ""We have seen sustained activity in election campaigns both in '97 and '92,"" he said. ""We take note of that and we will be doing everything possible to secure the safety of those taking part in the election and the general public."" A spokesman for Scotland Yard said no warning was given ahead of the latest blast and no-one has admitted carrying out the attack. But Mr Fry said: ""The most likely dissident group to be responsible was the Real IRA in view of their on-going terror campaign in Northern Ireland and London."" Last month, a device exploded on the steps of the Hendon sorting office but no-one was hurt. In the past year the capital has been hit by several bombings blamed on the terrorist group. These include the bombing of BBC Television Centre, a rocket attack on MI6's headquarters and an explosion on Hammersmith Bridge.     Dissident republicans opposed to the IRA ceasefire known as the Real IRA had been carrying out attacks in Northern Ireland and England since 1998, starting with the Omagh bombing that killed 29 people in August of that year. On 4 March 2001 a massive bomb exploded outside BBC Television Centre in London. A month later Hendon post office was bombed. Three months after the second blast, there was another attack in London - this time in Ealing Broadway shopping centre injuring seven people. In November 2001 a bomb went off in Birmingham city centre but no-one was hurt. In April 2003, five men - Noel Maguire, Aiden Hulme, James McCormack, John Hannan and Robert Hulme - were jailed for between 16 and 22 years for carrying out the BBC, Ealing and Birmingham bombings.

330,"A ladybird which has already caused havoc to native insects in America has been spotted near a pub in Essex. Harmonia axyridis posed a ""deadly threat"" to butterflies, lacewings and ladybirds, Dr Michael Majerus of Cambridge University said. The ladybird is an Asian species which was introduced into North America 25 years ago to fight aphids. It has since spread to Europe and last month was discovered in the gardens of the White Lion pub in Sible Hedingham. It is critical to monitor this ladybird now, before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own British ladybirds    The ladybird, which is also known as harlequin or the multi-coloured ladybug, was seen at the pub on 19 September and identified by Dr Majerus at the university's genetics department. Dr Majerus said: ""This is without doubt the ladybird I have least wanted to see here. ""I knew it was on its way, but I hoped that it wouldn't be so soon. Now many of our ladybirds will be in direct competition with this aggressively invasive species, and some will simply not cope."" The adult H. axyridis is about 7mm long, slightly larger than the seven-spot ladybird native to the UK. It comes in a range of colours and patterns. The one found in Essex was black with two very bold red spots and two smaller red spots. But the bugs can also be orange in colour and checked in pattern. H. axyridis is still sold in North America as a pest control. ""It is now the commonest ladybird in North America,"" Dr Majerus told BBC News. ""It is outcompeting pretty much all of the aphid-feeding native American ladybirds which are going through anything from a slight to a very, very serious decline. ""And there are lacewing, hoverfly larvae and even butterflies that are suffering because this thing is eating all the food, and it is also eating as secondary food butterfly eggs, and other ladybirds and lacewing larvae."" Despite this unwelcome and well-publicised take-over, the harlequin ladybirds are also still being sold in continental Europe by biocontrol companies. The bug now roams across France, Belgium and Holland, with numbers soaring annually. Harlequins also feed on fruit juices as they fuel up for the winter and fruit-growers are finding that they blemish many soft fruits, reducing the value of the crop. Wineries report the bugs also taint the vintage because of their acrid defensive chemicals. Dr Majerus believes there is still time to save the UK from a full invasion. He urges anyone who finds the insect to send it to him with precise details on when and where the ladybird was found. ""It is critical to monitor this ladybird now, before it gets out of control and starts to annihilate our own British ladybirds,"" he said.

331,"A disused road tunnel in south London has been turned into a giant exhibition space by graffiti artist Banksy.  Murals in the Bristol artist's famous stencil style appear with work by 29 other artists in a half-mile stretch of the tunnel in Leake Street, Waterloo.  Images of Madonna kissing Britney Spears and a hoodie appear alongside installations of crashed cars.  People can add their own stencil work to the tunnel walls in a three-day exhibition, opening on Saturday.  Reclusive artist Banksy kept the tunnel's location secret until Friday morning.  He said the exhibition, known as the Cans Festival, aimed to ""transform a dark forgotten filth pit"" into ""an oasis of beautiful art"".  ""I've always felt anyone with a paint can should have as much say in how our cities look as architects and ad men,"" Banksy said.  The installations will be removed after the event but Banksy said he hoped the murals and graffiti would become permanent part of the tunnel.  They also include images of a girl holding flowers, London Bridge, the Queen and Boris Johnson.  An installation depicts a burnt-out car crashed into a tree while another stencil spells out: ""Hey Banksy - why don't you return my emails?""  In recent years his work has grown in popularity, with Brad Pitt and Christina Aguilera listed among celebrity collectors.  In January a piece of his graffiti in Portobello Road, west London - which shows a painter finishing off the word ""Banksy"" - attracted a bid of £208,100 in an online auction."
332,"World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko has called off the defence of his titles against Frenchman Jean-Marc Mormeck on Saturday.  Klitschko, who holds the IBF, IBO, WBO and WBA belts, was taken to hospital on Friday to have a kidney stone removed.  The 35-year-old initially hoped he would recover in time to face Mormeck in Dusseldorf on 10 December, however his management advised him to pull out.  Wladimir's manager Bernd Bonte said: ""He is sad but he feels extreme pain.""  Bonte added there were provisional plans to stage the fight on 3 March 2012, the nominal date for Klitschko to fight a mandatory challenger under IBF rules.  ""We hope to know in two or three days. Mormeck is also ready to accept it.""  After undergoing the operation on Saturday Klitschko spent the day in hospital with a high temperature and inflammation.  ""Wladimir shouldn't fight any time soon,"" German urologist Peter Albertz said during the press conference.  ""Anyone who sustains two surgeries in a span of less than 24 hours needs considerable time to rest.  ""He is very weak after two surgeries and it makes no sense to have a fight now.""  Klitschko defeated Britain's David Haye on points in July to win the WBA title.  Mormeck, 39, is a former WBC and WBA cruiserweight champion, who was defeated by Haye at that level in 2007.  However, he is undefeated since moving to heavyweight in 2009, winning three bouts against Vinny Maddalone, Fres Oquendo and Timur Ibragimov.  Wladimir's older brother Vitali holds the only other major heavyweight belt after defending his WBC title in September against Pole Tomasz Adamek."
333,"British academic Angus Deaton has been awarded the Nobel economics prize for 2015 for his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare.  The 69-year-old Princeton University professor said he was delighted to have won the prize.  Professor Deaton described himself as ""someone who's concerned with the poor of the world and how people behave, and what gives them a good life"".  His research focuses on health, wellbeing, and economic development.  Torsten Persson, secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences award committee, said that Professor Deaton's work has had ""enormous influence"", particularly in India where the government had reshaped its measurement of poverty.  It had also been very influential in the academic community by reshaping various branches of economics, he said.  While Professor Deaton expected extreme poverty to continue decreasing, he did not want to be ""blindly optimistic"" because ""tremendous health problems among adults and children in India"" still existed.  Professor Deaton said that half of Indian children were still malnourished: ""For many people in the world, things are very bad indeed.""  The academy said that individuals' consumption choices must be understood before economic policy aimed at reducing poverty could be formulated.  ""More than anyone else, Angus Deaton has enhanced this understanding. By linking detailed individual choices and aggregate outcomes, his research has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics.""  The work for which Professor Deaton has been honoured revolved around three questions:  ""His research has uncovered important pitfalls when comparing the extent of poverty across time and place,"" the committee said.  The Edinburgh-born academic, who had been in the running for the prize several times in past years, was previously at Cambridge and Bristol universities.  The economics award was not created by Alfred Nobel in 1895, but was added by Sweden's central bank in 1968 as a memorial to the Swedish industrialist.  The Nobel prizes will be given to winners on 10 December at ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo."
334,"Independent observers say just over 38% of the electorate voted, well short of the 50% needed to make the poll valid.  Unofficial results indicate nationalist Tomislav Nikolic leads the field, in a vote boycotted by the main opposition.  Government candidate Dragoljub Micunovic appears to have been pushed into second.  Correspondents say the outcome is a setback for the ruling pro-Western coalition as it seeks a mandate for reform at December's parliamentary elections.  Two main opposition parties are claiming the election is irrelevant, while many people have become disillusioned after a spate of well publicised scandals involving members of the government, our correspondent says.  To make it even harder to achieve the necessary turnout, it is believed half a million potential voters live abroad and could have only cast their ballots if they returned home.  With a general election having just been announced for 28 December, many people may be waiting until then before giving their verdict on the country's politicians.  If one of the candidates is elected he will be the first democratically elected president of Serbia since the fall of Slobodan Milosevic's regime in what was then Yugoslavia in October 2000.  The reformist government of Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic has been struggling since the assassination of former premier Zoran Djindjic by a sniper in Belgrade on 12 March."

336,"He also welcomed the decision to replace him with Air Force General Joseph Ralston.  It said Gen Clark had been criticised for being ""too political"" simply because he wanted to ""use his authority to actually accomplish something"".  The paper said that he had led the alliance to a victory in Kosovo that essentially saved its credibility and its future.  It said he managed to forge a successful strategy while taking orders from 19 separate allied governments, which did indeed require him to have political skills.  Gen Clark has repeatedly denied speculation that the decision for him to leave his post next April instead of next July was due to his handling of the alliance's 11-week air war against Yugoslavia.  However an editorial in The Los Angeles Times said that ""differences with the White House and the Pentagon clearly are factors in Clark's departure"".  Correspondents say he consistently urged more aggressive tactics, including the possibility of a ground invasion of Kosovo if the air strikes failed.  His request to use Apache attack helicopters in the air war was turned down by the Pentagon.  In an interview published in The New Yorker magazine, Gen Clark acknowledged his frustration with what he called ""the only air campaign in history in which lovers strolled down riverbanks in the gathering twilight ... to watch the fireworks"".  The US Defence Department said Gen Clark's early departure was not a result of dissatisfaction with his performance, but part of a general rotation of American senior ranks.  Nato Secretary-General Javier Solana paid a warm tribute to Gen Clark who, he said, ""has made and will continue to make a major contribution to peace in Europe and to the shaping of a new alliance ready for the 21st Century""."
337,"Andrew Bird is part of Edinburgh's Edge festival - a musical accompaniment to the Fringe    Andrew Bird is renowned for his jaw-dropping live shows. The Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist alternates between vocals, violin, guitar and glockenspiel - with whistling and live violin loops thrown into the musical mix. Close your eyes and you would think there were six musicians up on stage. Bird's blend of alt-rock and Americana soars into full flight when he is playing live. He plays in Edinburgh this week, as part of the Edge Festival - formerly known as T on the Fringe. On a recent visit to Scotland, Bird told me: ""Almost every show I change the arrangement of the songs and mix up the set as much as possible. ""I kind of mix performance with writing. I consider them almost the same thing sometimes."" The virtuoso musicianship is impressive, but Bird is most astonishing when he lives dangerously close to the edge. ""I might go as far to say I cultivate it,"" he said. ""It's that slight flush of embarrassment when things don't quite go well which makes that night special. ""If everything was perfectly comfortable and executed, I'm afraid I would lose some edge."" I got kind of excited, lifted the violin up and it snapped out of my hands and broke into two pieces in front of 3,500 people    An edge-of-the-precipice moment came in Chicago recently when the musical juggling act came crashing to the ground when Bird's violin dramatically slipped from his hands and smashed to the floor. He said: ""It's what could happen every night - and should happen more often. ""It was just kind of funny that it was a hometown show in Chicago and all my friends and family were there. It was pretty high pressure. The violin is connected to multiple wires and I stepped on a cable. ""I got kind of excited, lifted the violin up and it snapped out of my hands and broke into two pieces in front of 3,500 people. It looked pretty bad at the time because it was in two bits. ""But I get strangely calm and philosophical at those moments. ""The sound of the violin breaking got into one of the loops and kept cycling around, and part of me was like - that's really cool. ""I was trying to cue it up as I was finishing the show on guitar."" Bird likes nothing better than to smash barriers between musical styles. He is like a mad scientist, tinkering in his laboratory and performing implausible experiments to produce a chemical concoction of musical elements. Classically-trained, he started playing violin aged four using the Suzuki method. ""I learned completely by ear so I learned like a folk musician,"" he said. ""I was never a particularly good student. I wouldn't practice my scales. But I absorbed a lot."" So does he use his classical training in his songwriting? ""I guess I do in a way. I grew up listening to it but I have absolutely nothing to do with the classical mind-set and the culture around it,"" he said. After graduating from Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree in Violin Performance he experimented with everything from folk and jazz to swing and alt country. ""Somewhere around the age of 27 something happened where I let the music consume me completely,"" Bird said. ""Before that I was part music fan, part student, part songwriter. And at some point I just became what I do now and that's when my songs stopped sounding like any style in particular."" One of the songs from his new CD, Noble Beast - Effigy- has a distinctly Scottish sound. He said: ""When I was 20 I was deeply into Scottish and English folk music so it has been an influence. ""For this song I got the shape of a melody in my head and I had the words 'effigy' and 'affable' with a Scottish lilt to them. ""So I had to construct something around them and I thought I'd play a really simple country style - and a fiddle solo - with a Scottish feel to it."" Bird's songs are full of eccentric words that sound like they've tumbled out of a Scrabble box - radiolarians, dermestids and plecostomus. ""I guess I'm trying to get outside of the everyday vernacular and get interesting words,"" he said. ""Sometimes I'm drawn in by how the vowels and syllables come together and then struggle to have it all make sense. ""I'm fascinated by that time when things were still being discovered and named. Sometimes I'll take a name no-one knows and reintroduce it. I'll often take an old word that's beautiful like 'sovay' or 'souverian'. ""When I was into old British folk music I'd be fascinated by the words and the archaic expressions. ""I also read a lot of Saul Bellow writing about Chicago in the 1930s and 40s with its street language and colourful expressions."" It is hard to predict where Bird's music will take him and his fans next. But he provides a few clues. ""I'd like to try to go back to recording with just one microphone - the band gathering around - a really simple live thing,"" he said. ""I really like to listen to really simple music that's uncorrupted and inherently musical. On the other hand I thought about a wall of sound collage."" Whatever this eccentric musical genius turns his hand to next, it's guaranteed that it won't sound like anybody or anything else.     "
338,"Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis said his position had become untenable Latvian Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis and his centre-right government have resigned, amid turmoil triggered by economic crisis in the Baltic state. President Valdis Zatlers has accepted the resignations and is beginning talks to try to form a new administration. The country's economy is in recession and is set to contract by up to 12% in 2009, with unemployment rising by 50%. Latvia's is the second European government, after Iceland, to fall as a direct result of global economic woes. Earlier, the two largest parties in Latvia's ruling coalition, the People's Party and the Union of Greens and Farmers, both demanded Mr Godmanis's resignation. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. People's Party Chairman Mareks Seglins said it was the only way to help boost public trust in the unpopular government. A protest over economic policy in the capital, Riga, on 13 January ended in more than 100 arrests. More than 40 people were injured. Mr Godmanis, a member of the small Latvia's First/Latvia's Way party, then survived a parliamentary confidence vote on 3 February. But on Friday Mr Zatlers announced that the prime minister had submitted his resignation and that it had been accepted. Mr Godmanis said his position had become untenable after his two main coalition partners had failed to back him earlier in the day. Latvia has experienced years of boom, but is now in recession ""I told them this is the moment of truth,"" he said. The president said he would hold talks on Monday on a new coalition with leaders from all of the country's political parties. Correspondents say the new administration will have a difficult task reviving the economy of the country of 2.4 million people. Latvia's economy has shrunk at its fastest rate since the early 1990s, after it split from the Soviet Union and regained its independence. Latvia's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 10.5% in the last quarter of 2008, compared with the same period a year earlier. Economists believe GDP could fall as much as 10% this year. The country had enjoyed several boom years - in 2006 the economy was still growing by 12% a year - but the global credit crunch has hit Latvia hard. Correspondents say a major reason for the decline was that locally-owned banks, which make up 40% of the Latvian financial system, were taking deposits from abroad and investing them in the booming property market. When the property market begin to decline and foreign credit dried up, confidence in Latvian banks evaporated. The second largest bank, Parex, collapsed after depositors panicked and has been largely nationalised. In December 2008 the Latvian government was forced to seek 7.5bn euros (£6.6bn; $9.5bn) from the IMF, World Bank and EU to bail itself out. As part of the deal it has had to cut public spending and increase taxes - both unpopular policies.     "
339,"The USSR won the inaugural finals in 1960, with the competition then known as the Uefa European Nations Cup.  The championship has grown in stature and importance since then and produced many memorable moments.  Here we look at six of the best.  The 1988 finals were the first the Republic of Ireland had reached and the draw for the tournament handed them an opening game fixture against England.  The press gave the Republic, managed by Jack Charlton, no chance against a highly fancied England team that included John Barnes and Gary Lineker.  England never recovered, losing their other two group games.  Ireland drew with Russia but lost to Holland in their crucial third match and just missed out on the semi-finals.  Czechoslovakia won the tournament in 1976, and if one moment crystallizes their victory it was Antonin Panenka's penalty in the final.  The unfancied Czechs defeated the mighty Soviet Union and Holland on their way to the final where they came up against a West German team boasting Uli Hoeness, Berti Vogts and Franz Beckenbauer.  And following 30 minutes extra-time, the match went to penalties.  After Hoeness missed the target, Panenka stepped up knowing that if he struck the ball past Sepp Maier the cup was Czechoslovakia's.  Panenka strolled up and chipped the ball down the middle of the net with barely enough force to carry it across the line.  Maier had dived to his left and could only watch in horror as the ball, almost carried by the wind, drifted over the line.  The 1984 European Championship had been a feast of football, with France delighting the home crowds with some breathtaking football.  The home nation had progressed well through the group stages. Midfield maestro Michael Platini was in his pomp and the entire nation was crying out for their team to go the whole way.  But Portugal stood between them and a place in the final.  The home team led for most of the match but Rui Jordao first equalised and then put Portugal ahead, 2-1, in extra-time.  France, who had missed numerous chances, restored parity with Jean-Francois Domergue's second goal of the match before skipper/hero/genius Michel Platini fired in a winner, with penalties just a minute away.  The two nations met again in another classic Euro semi-final in 2000.  Again France won in dramatic fashion, with Zinedine Zidane scoring a Golden Goal penalty.  Most of the Denmark squad were on holiday when Yugoslavia's late withdrawal handed them a second chance.  And so began one of the most remarkable stories in football history as Richard Moller Nielsen's team went all the way to win their first major tournament.  Next came holders Holland and a thrilling contest that went all the way to penalties, with Peter Schmeichel making a dramatic save from Marco van Basten to take his team through to the final.  By this stage it almost seemed Denmark's destiny to win and so it proved as Nielsen's team beat Germany 2-0.  The Germans might have walked off with the main prize but it will be remembered as the tournament that brought England together.  It turned out to be Gazza's swansong at international level but what a way to sign off, turning Colin Hendry inside out and celebrating by replicating the infamous pre-tournament dentist's chair incident.  Terry Venables' team also thrashed the talented Dutch with the best display by an England team in decades.  Throw in the penalty shoot-out win against Spain and David Seaman's spot-kick save against Scotland and the tournament was a rollercoaster of emotions that put the pride back in English football.  Of course, it all ended in predictable fashion for England when they lost to Germany on penalties in the semi-final.  The volley Holland striker Marco van Basten scored against the Soviet Union in the 1988 final is arguably the best goal in European Championship history.  Van Basten was in electrifying form throughout the tournament and had already left England's hopes in tatters with a brilliant hat-trick.  But he saved his best for the final.  It did not seem possible to score from where Van Basten was positioned when Arnold Muhren's cross reached him.  But standing virtually on the bye-line at the edge of the penalty area, the Dutch hitman unleashed a thunderous right-foot volley that nestled in the top corner of the opposition net.  ""I thought Van Basten was going to control the ball,"" said Muhren. ""I don't think many players would have even thought to shoot from that angle. There was great disbelief."""
340,"Sean Quinn has been listed as one of Ireland's richest businessmen. Sean Quinn has said the appointment of administrators to his insurance company threatens thousands of jobs. On Wednesday, the High Court in Dublin ruled that the move was necessary because the company's liabilities significantly outweighed its assets. Mr Quinn told RTE the decision was ""one of the biggest errors ever in the history of corporate Ireland"". Northern Ireland politicians will meet Quinn Group management at the company headquarters in Fermanagh on Friday. Those attending include Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew, enterprise minister and MLA for the area Arlene Foster as well as local MLAs Tom Elliott and Tommy Gallagher. Quinn Insurance has confirmed that it will not be taking on new business in Northern Ireland and will not be renewing existing car policies when they run out. The company has organised protest marches in Cavan and Dublin next Tuesday at noon. Mr Quinn said on Thursday that his family, one of the richest in Ireland, had lost 3bn euros (£2.66bn) in share deals in the last three years. The financial regulator, Matthew Elderfield, has said his office applied to appoint provisional administrators because the he believed Quinn Insurance's assets had been overstated by about 450 million euros. They have taken the carpet from under me    He said this meant a potential shortfall in the company's ability to meet claims against it. But Mr Quinn has said that he had no problem paying backs his debts because his group was making profits of between 400 and 500m euros a year. He accused the regulator of destroying his reputation and that of his family. He told RTE: ""It is the most extraordinary decision I have ever come across. They have taken the carpet from under me. They have taken my model, taken my business. ""It is going to be a huge job to regain that confidence."" Quinn Group chief executive Liam McCaffrey told the Irish Times on Friday that the family's ability to pay back the money it owes Anglo-Irish was dependent on a ""very robust"" Quinn Insurance group, either through ""cash-flow or disposal"". Mr McCaffrey said that concerns about the Quinn Group's 1.2bn euros (£1.06bn) debts, separate to the family's borrowings, were unfounded because there was no prospect of the loans being called in by the lenders. The newspaper reported that the provisional administrators have received about 20 inquiries from groups interested in buying all or part of the insurance business. But the administrators, Grant Thornton, said it was ""premature"" to consider a sale at this point. As well as the insurance section, Quinn Group includes companies selling other products including cement and health cover. It employs about 5,500 people across Ireland. It is one of the biggest employers in Fermanagh, where Mr Quinn grew up and neighbouring Cavan, where he now lives.     "
341,"There are ""no circumstances"" in which Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe could be released from prison, Justice Secretary Jack Straw has said. He was answering a question in the Commons from Tory MP Julie Kirkbride on behalf of one of her constituents, a relative of one of Sutcliffe's victims. Sutcliffe, 63, who murdered 13 women across northern England, has begun a legal bid to limit his time in jail. He was given 20 life terms in 1981 for the murders and seven other attacks. Ms Kirkbride, who represents Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, said her constituent wanted a reassurance that Sutcliffe ""will never be let out of prison for his heinous crimes"". Mr Straw answered: ""I would like to provide that reassurance... ultimately that decision would be a matter for the parole board and the courts and maybe for mental health tribunals. ""But I say to you, and through you to your constituent, that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released."" Sutcliffe, who is now known as Peter Coonan, is being held in Broadmoor top security psychiatric hospital. All the evidence...suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released    He was transferred there from prison in 1984 after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. When he was sentenced at the Old Bailey in 1981 the trial judge, Mr Justice Boreham, recommended that he serve a minimum of 30 years behind bars. However no formal tariff was given. It was revealed earlier this month that Sutcliffe was seeking a High Court ruling on how much longer he must spend in jail. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said they do not comment on individual cases, and that the decision for setting a minimum tariff was a matter for the High Court. He added: ""Ministers now have no involvement in setting tariffs and it would not be appropriate to enter into speculation as to the result. ""The setting of a tariff has no bearing on whether or not an individual is released from a secure hospital and into the prison system; discharge from hospital is a matter for doctors and for the independent mental health review tribunal. ""The tariff expiry point is not a date of release. It is the first point at which a prisoner can ask a parole board to consider their suitability for release.""     "
342,"New era for policing and justice in Northern Ireland  David Ford is leader of the cross-community Alliance Party Northern Ireland's new justice minister David Ford will have a special place in Stormont history, in more ways than one. His office is situated in Castle Buildings where the Good Friday Agreement - the so-called peace deal - was signed in April 1998. When he sits down down at his new desk, he will become the first Northern Ireland politician to hold security powers since 1972. That was the worst year of the Troubles - 479 people were killed. Northern Ireland was in turmoil, and local politicians were not trusted by the then Prime Minister Edward Heath to be in charge of justice and policing. It is a measure of how much has changed in recent years that those powers are now being handed back. However, such powers are still so sensitive that the two largest parties, the DUP and Sinn Fein, could not agree on a unionist or a nationalist candidate. David Ford is the leader of the cross-community Alliance Party. It's a bit like the stabilisers coming off the bicycle. We're being given the chance to prove ourselves and demonstrate that we're grown up enough to go forward without any help    The 59-year-old former social worker studied economics at university and now looks like being faced with the biggest numbers of his career - a department with 4,491 employees, and a £1.4bn budget. Two-thirds of the money is taken up with policing. The job description can be boiled down to three words - keeping people safe. It is easier said than done, particularly given the threat posed by dissident republicans opposed to the peace process. Also, the marching season will soon begin in Northern Ireland. There will be no time for a relaxed, settling-in period. The minister will not be able to interfere with the day-to-day running of the police or courts, but will decide on overall policy and could reshape parts of the system. If the new minister wants to make a mark before the next Assembly Election in May next year, there will not be much time to do it. Stand by for a high-action few months. Clues to what David Ford may try to do can be found on the Alliance Party website. It talks about the need for a long list of measures including: * more visible policing on the streets; * reform of and within the Northern Ireland Prison Service. All of the above will take time. It is unlikely that a week after the devolution of policing powers that anything much in Northern Ireland will seem to have changed. However, the level of accountability will rise significantly. Policing and justice matters will be scrutinised like never before, and if you have a bone to pick with the minister in charge, you no longer need to wait in the arrivals lounge of Belfast International Airport for him or her to arrive on a plane from London. The new minister faces a huge challenge, and so does the entire power-sharing executive, as they exercise the new functions handed over from London. However, some see it as an opportunity rather than a challenge. One Stormont insider put it like this: ""It's a bit like the stabilisers coming off the bicycle. We're being given the chance to prove ourselves. And demonstrate that we're grown up enough to go forward without any help."" Don't be surprised if there are a few wobbles along the way.     "

344,"The British government accepts that colonial forces in Kenya tortured and abused detainees during the Mau Mau rebellion, the High Court has heard.  Three elderly Kenyans who are suing the government for damages were told it did not dispute that ""terrible things"" had happened to them.  Their lawyers say it is the first ever official acknowledgement by the UK.  The revolt against British rule in Kenya in the 1950s and 1960s was marked by atrocities, with thousands killed.  The British government argues that too much time has passed for a fair hearing to be conducted.  Before starting cross-examination of witnesses, the QC for the British government, Guy Mansfield, said he did not want to dispute that civilians had suffered ""torture and ill-treatment at the hands of the colonial administration"".  He spoke directly to each of the witnesses, saying he did ""not want to dispute the fact that terrible things happened to you"".  Papers in the test case were first served on the UK in 2009.  In 2011, a High Court judge ruled the claimants - Paulo Muoka Nzili, Wambuga Wa Nyingi and Jane Muthoni Mara - did have an arguable case.  The claimants' lawyers allege that Mr Nzili was castrated, Mr Nyingi was severely beaten and Mrs Mara was subjected to appalling sexual abuse in detention camps during the rebellion.  A fourth claimant, Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua, has died since the High Court ruling that the test case could go ahead.  With the help of interpreters at the High Court, the three - now in their 70s and 80s - were briefly questioned about written evidence they had provided.  In a 20-page statement, Mr Nzili, 85, gave details of being stripped, chained and castrated, with large pliers normally used on cows, at Embakasi detention camp, near Nairobi.  He said: ""I felt completely destroyed and without hope. I have never had children of my own and never will have. I am unable to have sexual relations with my wife.""  Mrs Mara, 73, submitted evidence describing how, at the age of 15, she was taken to Gatithi detention camp, where she was beaten by the British and subjected to sexual abuse with a glass bottle containing very hot water.  She said she had felt ""completely and utterly violated"", adding that the pain ""has been bad ever since the beatings and has worsened as I have aged"".  ""I do not understand why I was treated with such brutality for simply having provided food to the Mau Mau.  ""I want the British citizens of today to know what their forefathers did to me and to so many others. These crimes cannot go unpunished and forgotten.""  In his statement, Mr Nyingi, 84 - a father of 16 who still works as a casual labourer - described being arrested on Christmas Eve 1952 and held for nine years.  During his detention, in 1959, he said he was beaten unconscious during an incident at Hola camp in which 11 other prisoners were clubbed to death.  ""If I could speak to the Queen I would say that Britain did many good things in Kenya, but that they also did many bad things,"" he said.  ""In the years before independence, people were beaten, their land was stolen, women were raped, men were castrated and their children were killed.  ""I would like the wrongs which were done to me and other Kenyans to be recognised by the British government so that I can die in peace.""  The three Kenyans want an official apology and damages to set up a Mau Mau welfare fund for the hundreds of Kenyans their lawyers say also suffered.  In his ruling in 2011, Mr Justice McCombe emphasised he had not found there was systematic torture in the Kenyan camps nor that, if there was, the British government was liable for what had passed.  It will now be decided whether a fair hearing is still possible.  The hearing will have access to an archive of 8,000 secret files that were sent back to Britain after Kenya gained its independence in 1963."

The 31-year-old was a free agent after being released by Charlton at the end of his second spell at The Valley at the end of last season.  He made 123 appearances in the Premier League for the Addicks between 2001-05.  The Grecians need defensive cover as Richard Duffy is out for a month after a groin operation and Billy Jones has a thigh problem.  Fortune, who has had trials at Leyton Orient and Gillingham recently, goes straight into the Exeter squad for the trip to MK Dons on Saturday."

Residents were told to keep doors and windows closed as much as possible to protect them from the smoke."
347,"        ...Continued Tim, this is how Humph describes you. See if you agree with what he says: ""Prone to argue with the chairman, slightly vulnerable, perspires a lot, a favourite with the crowd - people hiss when I'm cruel to him,"" said Humph.    Tim: Yes, I think none of that's true except the bit about my perspiring a lot. I do do that, I have to say. Yes, I'll accept that. I'm very pleased with that. Move on..    Barry, Humph describes you thus: ""The gag man. There are no embarrassing silences thanks to you...    Barry: Embarrassing noises but not silences.  Inteviewer: ...bottomless pit of one-liners, able to come up with gags at a second's notice, provides the bricks and mortar.""  Barry: And they let me appear in it sometimes as well. I bring my wheelbarrow. It's very gracious of him though, particularly about my quick wit.  Tim: Anyway, what would he know?    Graeme, you're described thus: ""Bides his time, picks his moment, a punchline man supreme, very dry, often has the perfect punchline which helps me (Humph) end the show on a high note.    Tim: Very dry as opposed to the very sweaty me, is that what he's saying?   Barry: Was that Humph who said that?  Interviewer: Yes.  Barry: I detect a very Graeme style in that.  Graeme: I put a stop to the fun basically is what he's saying.  Tim: Yes, but you bide your time about it.    Humph's very modest about his own comic abilities. What do you think his particular gifts are?    Barry: He's very arrogant, overbearing and quite ruthless.  Tim: I've been a fan of his since I was a teenager. I used to go listen to his band which still plays magnificently today. And I still get a thrill out of working with Humph. It's extraordinary, after all these years. He's such an incredibly nice and bright man and he is modest, but he shouldn't be. I think he's quite fantastic.  Barry: I still think 'It's him, it's him!'.    How much of his stuff is written and how much is ad-libbed?    Tim: Well, he is capable of writing everything but Iain Pattinson actually writes his script now. I think Iain would say that the great thing is you're writing for a great man. There's nothing worse for a writer than to write something that is delivered badly. Iain writes some good stuff and Humph makes it even better which is perfect for a writer.  Graeme: And, obviously, the nature of the show is not all scripted. Humph reads his links then we play the games and Humph says injections of his own and very often they're show-stoppers as well. He's an extremely funny man. I don't think he knows how funny he is or how he is funny which is probably a good thing - he just does it.  Barry: He's in a great tradition like Kenneth Horne was in Round the Horne - the obeying man in the middle with all the idiots milling about and he's never quite sure what's going on but he just wants to get it over.  Tim: And the seeming innocence allows him to be absolutely filthy. ""Humph can't have said that, can he?"" And, of course, everything he says is double entendre anyway and he looks really, genuinely surprised if the audience laughs. As Graeme says, he can ad-lib as well. I remember something he said during our recording on Sunday. He said something like ""Your hand writing is so bad, I have to pin it up and run past it to read it."" I don't quite know what it means but it made me laugh enormously.         Back to Interviews...     "
348,"The army corporal from south Dublin wasn't thought to have much of a chance against world champion Juan Hernandez Sierra of Cuba.  But, after the bout was tied 8-8 after the second round, Carruth won the third 5-2 and with it the title.  Wayne McCullough could have been the Irish hero but he had failed to win the bantamweight final earlier that day.  McCullough was considered to have had the best chance of becoming Ireland's first Olympic champion since Ron Delany won the 1500m in 1956.  But he had started slowly against another Cuban, Joel Casamayor Johnson, trailed 10-2 going into the third round and, despite a vigorous late onslaught, lost 14-8.  Carruth, whose father Austin was his trainer, recalled that he had then said in his dressing room: ""Dad, I'm going to win this fight.  ""I'm going to bring the gold medal back with me to Dublin. Ronnie Delany¿s time is up.""  Indeed his victory in the Joventut Pavilion saw him instantly promoted to sergeant back at home.  And, on the day of his return to Ireland, local pubs dropped the price of beer to that of 1956.  Thanks to Michael Carruth a pint of Guinness could be bought for four pence on that day in 1992!"
349,"The UAE base will host up to 500 French troops    President Nicolas Sarkozy has formally opened a French military base in the United Arab Emirates, France's first permanent base in the Gulf. The flags of France and the UAE were raised at a ceremony at the so-called ""Peace Camp"" in the Abu Dhabi emirate. France is a leading military supplier to the Gulf state, and signed a nuclear co-operation agreement last year. Its new base will host up to 500 French troops and include a navy base, air base, and training camp. The BBC's Stephanie Hancock in Abu Dhabi says the new military base, France's first outside its own territory for many years, comes on the back of strengthening diplomatic and military ties between France and the United Arab Emirates. The 500 troops will be there on a support and training capacity, rather than taking part in actual military operations. Through this base - the first in the Middle East - France is ready to shoulder its responsibilities to ensure stability in this strategic region    But our correspondent says the base will provide all-important reassurance to the Emirates, which, along with many of its Arab neighbours, is concerned about the nuclear threat posed by Iran. ""Be assured that France is on your side in the event your security is at risk,"" Mr Sarkozy said in an interview with the UAE's official news agency. ""Through this base - the first in the Middle East - France is ready to shoulder its responsibilities to ensure stability in this strategic region."" An aide to Mr Sarkozy is quoted by AFP news agency linking the base to an alleged Iranian threat: ""We are deliberately taking a deterrent stance. If Iran were to attack, we would effectively be attacked also."" Correspondents say the base has drawn some criticism in French political circles for just that reason, with centrist politician Francois Bayrou warning that France risked being dragged into a regional war. Mr Sarkozy flew to Abu Dhabi on Monday with four ministers and a delegation of senior businesspeople. He opened the visit by dining with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Officials said talks are continuing over the possible sale of 60 new Rafale jets to the UAE in a deal worth up to eight billion euros ($11bn). The multi-role Rafale - which has yet to find a foreign buyer - could replace the Emirates' fleet of French Mirage 2000 combat planes. In addition to the inauguration of Peace Camp, Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the site of a Louvre Museum branch which France is opening in the United Arab Emirates. The US maintains the predominant foreign military presence in the Gulf, with key air bases and logistics operations, and its Fifth Fleet housed in Bahrain. However, Peace Camp gives France a strategic position on the vital Gulf shipping corridor, which carries about 40% of the world's petroleum supplies.     "
350,"A motorcyclist caught speeding at 137mph has been banned in the week Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson encouraged motorists to have fun on Welsh roads.  Ross Curwell was banned by Flintshire magistrates from driving for a year after admitting dangerous driving on a road at Treuddyn between Mold and Corwen, in north Wales.  The 38-year-old hairdresser was caught during North Wales Police's Arrive Alive campaign last July.  North Wales Police have denied that since Clarkson's gaffe on the programme - heard by millions of viewers - there has been a clampdown on motorists.  The BBC Two presenter prompted a backlash when he said Wales was best to test drive cars because ""no-one wants to live there"".  On another occasion, Clarkson snipped Wales off a map and stuffed it in a microwave.  Clwyd West AM Alun Pugh has written to BBC director general Greg Dyke to complain about the presenter's comments.  A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were ""nonsense"".  His latest comments follow a rap on the knuckles four years ago for ""bigotted and racist"" remarks at the Birmingham Motor Show, in which he said Korean staff from Hyundai UK had eaten dogs.  Last year, the BBC received complaints from politicians over comments by Weakest Link presenter Anne Robinson, in which she said the Welsh were ""irritating"".  North Wales Police sent officers to interview Mr Dyke about the incident after a separate complaint about alleged racism by Ms Robinson was made.  In relation to its anti-speeding campaign, the force said it intended to make roads in the region safer, but the force has denied carrying out a purge on motorists.  Curwell admitted the record speeding incident on the A5104 was a ""moment of madness"" on his part.  The defendant's Kawasaki 1200cc bike had been fitted with a speed limiter, restricting it to 178mph, the court was told.  In addition to his ban, Curwell, of Edward Street, Cheshire, was ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work under a community punishment order, supervised by the probation service.  Prosecutor Huw Evans said he was concerned Mr Evans was caught speeding at a crossroads after overtaking two other motorcyclists.  He will also have to take an extended driving test before being allowed to drive again.  ""I made a mistake and now I have to do the hours,"" said Mr Curwell.  Chris Johnson, defending, said his client admitted his actions were not those of a competent motorist.  ""This was a moment of madness.  ""With hindsight he realises that it was silly to allow himself to get carried away like that,"" Mr Johnson explained.  Following the case, Chief Superintendent Gwynn Vaughan Jones, head of North Wales Police's operation support division, which includes road policing, said he welcomed the court's decision.  ""The court's decision clearly shows that people who are prepared to take such risks will be penalised, not only by fines but by other sanctions as well,"" he said."

Hopefully if we do reconvene at some point in the future we'll be refreshed and have so many ideas to bring to what it is we do."" His comments come after frontman Kele Okereke recently confirmed that the band will take a lengthy break after their current tour.  ""I definitely don't think this will be the last you'll hear of the people who make up Bloc Party,"" Tong admitted.     ""Kele is an insatiable workaholic and creating is something he is so connected to so you'll definitely hear from him again along with Russell (Lissack) and Gordon (Moakes) also.      ""As for me I don't know, I wouldn't mind trying something else for a while.""      The band, who are in the middle of mammoth UK tour, were due to perform at Newport Centre tonight (16 October) but have pulled the show after Lissack had to undergo a ""medical procedure"".     A statement on the band's website added: ""Bloc Party have unfortunately been forced to cancel this Friday's Newport show as guitarist Russell Lissack has to undergo a medical procedure which, whilst not being serious, cannot be delayed until the end of the tour."""
352,"He was the British extreme right's most feared streetfighter. But almost right up to his death 20 years ago, Nicky Crane led a precarious dual existence - until it fell dramatically apart.  The skinhead gang marched in military formation down the High Street clutching iron bars, knives, staves, pickaxe handles and clubs.  There were at least 100 of them. They had spent two days planning their attack. The date was 28 March 1980.  Soon they reached their target - a queue of mostly black filmgoers outside the Odeon cinema in Woolwich, south-east London.  Most of them belonged to an extreme far-right group called the British Movement (BM).  This particular ""unit"" had already acquired a reputation for brutal racist violence thanks to its charismatic young local organiser. Many victims had learned to fear the sight of his 6ft 2in frame, which was adorned with Nazi tattoos. His name was Nicky Crane.  But as he led the ambush, Crane was concealing a secret from his enemies and his fascist comrades alike. Crane knew he was gay, but hadn't acted on it. Not yet.  Twelve years later, the same Nicky Crane sat in his Soho bedsit. His room looked out across London's gay village - the bars and nightclubs where he worked as a doorman, where he drank and danced.  Crane flicked through a scrapbook filled with photos and news clippings from his far-right past.  For years he had managed to keep the two worlds entirely separate. But now he wasn't going to pretend any more.  Nicola Vincenzo Crane was born on 21 May 1958 in a semi-detached house on a leafy street in Bexley, south-east London. One of 10 siblings, he grew up in nearby Crayford, Kent.  As his name suggests, he had an unlikely background for a British nationalist and Aryan warrior. He was of Italian heritage through his mother Dorothy, whose maiden name was D'Ambrosio. His father worked as a structural draughtsman.  But from an early age Crane found a surrogate family in the south-east London skinhead scene.  Its members had developed a reputation for violence, starting fights and disrupting gigs by bands such as Sham 69 and Bad Manners. In the late 1970s, gangs like Crane's were widely feared.  ""When you've come from a tough background, when you get that identity, it's a powerful thing to have,"" says Gavin Watson, a former skinhead who later got to know Crane.  The south-east London skins also had close connections to the far right. Whereas the original skinheads in the late 1960s had borrowed the fashion of Caribbean immigrants and shared their love of ska and reggae music, a highly visible minority of skins during the movement's revival in the late 1970s were attaching themselves to groups like the resurgent National Front (NF).  In particular the openly neo-Nazi BM, under the leadership of Michael McLaughlin, was actively targeting young, disaffected working-class men from football terraces as well as the punk and skinhead scenes for recruitment.  Crane was an enthusiastic convert to the ideology of National Socialism.  ""Adolf Hitler was my God,"" he said in a 1992 television interview. ""He was sort of like my Fuhrer, my leader. And everything I done was, like, for Adolf Hitler.""  Within six months of joining the BM, Crane had been made the Kent organiser, responsible for signing up new members and organising attacks on political opponents and minority groups.  He was also inducted into the Leader Guard, which served both as McLaughlin's personal corps of bodyguards and as the party's top fighters. Members wore black uniforms adorned with neo-Nazi symbols and were drilled at paramilitary-style armed training weekends in the countryside.  They were also required to have a Leader Guard tattoo. Each featured the letters L and G on either side of a Celtic cross, the British Movement's answer to the swastika. Crane dutifully had his inked on to his flesh alongside various racist slogans.  By now working as a binman and living in Plumstead, Crane quickly acquired a reputation, even among the ranks of the far right, for exceptionally brutal violence.  In May 1978, following a BM meeting, he took part in an assault on a black family at a bus stop in Bishopsgate, east London, using broken bottles and shouting racist slogans. An Old Bailey judge described Crane as ""worse than an animal"".  The following year he led a mob of 200 skinheads in an attack on Asians in nearby Brick Lane. Crane later told a newspaper how ""we rampaged down the Lane turning over stalls, kicking and punching Pakistanis"".  The Woolwich Odeon attack of 1980 was described by a prosecutor at the Old Bailey as a ""serious, organised and premeditated riot"". After their intended victims fled inside, the skinheads drilled by Crane began smashing the cinema's doors and windows, the court was told. A Pakistani man was knocked unconscious in the melee and the windows of a nearby pub were shattered with a pickaxe handle.  In 1981 Crane was jailed for his part in an ambush on black youths at Woolwich Arsenal station. As the judge handed down a four-year sentence, an acolyte standing alongside Crane stiffened his arm into a Nazi salute and shouted ""sieg heil"" from the dock.  Crane's three jail terms failed to temper his violence. During one stretch, he launched an attack on several prison officers with a metal tray. A six-month sentence following a fracas on a London Tube train was served entirely at the top-security Isle of Wight prison - a sign of just how dangerous he was regarded by the authorities.  All this may have horrified most people, but it made Crane a hugely respected and admired figure across the far right.  He was neither an orator nor a conversationalist. His vocabulary was sparse at best. But he managed to exude a powerful charisma.  ""I knew him, I liked him. He was friendly,"" says Joseph Pearce, who was leader of the Young National Front during the early 1980s before turning his back on extremist politics.  ""He was not the most articulate of people. It would be yes or no. It was difficult to have anything but the most superficial conversation with him.""  In the aftermath of a violent march through racially mixed Lewisham in 1977, much of the UK's extreme right had concluded the path to power lay in controlling the streets and destabilising the multicultural society rather than through the ballot box.  At the same time, groups like the Anti-Nazi League (ANL) and, later, Anti-Fascist Action (AFA) were becoming more and more confrontational.  ""The opposition were very, very combative,"" Pearce says. ""Their strategy was to smash the nationalist movement. It was a necessity to have a street presence that had muscle. Someone like Nicky Crane was a powerful physical but also symbolic presence.""  This was a description with which even Crane's enemies concurred.  ""By appearance and reputation he was the epitome of right-wing idealism - fascist icon and poster boy,"" writes Sean Birchall in his book Beating The Fascists, a history of AFA.  Unbeknown to his comrades, however, a very different side to Nicky Crane was emerging.  It was a Thursday night at Heaven, a gay nightclub below London's Charing Cross station. Underneath the venue's arched roof stood a young man, up from Brighton for the evening. A garrulous character, he was universally known by his full title of John G Byrne.  Since 1969, when he discovered reggae music as a 13-year-old, Byrne had been a skinhead. As he looked across the dancefloor, he caught sight of a man he'd never seen before.  The stranger was tall, shaven-headed and tattooed. Byrne introduced himself.  It was Nicky Crane, fresh out of prison.  ""He stood out quite a lot,"" says Byrne. ""A lot of people used to be quite keen on him because he was a very butch-looking geezer.""  Years later, Crane said he hadn't had sex with a man until after he turned 26 in 1984. But now he was becoming a regular at places like Heaven.  ""I just used to chat to him,"" Byrne adds. ""Nicky was quite a friendly person. He was quite quiet, really. He was the opposite of what he looked like.""  He appears to have thrown himself enthusiastically into the gay scene around this time. His imposing frame meant he easily found work as a doorman at gay venues through a security firm.  But if the neo-Nazi world would have abhorred his sexuality, the vast majority of London's gay scene would have been equally horrified to learn that he was a neo-Nazi.  Among the leadership of the largely liberal-left gay rights movement that was growing in London during the 1980s, fascist symbolism was an obvious and outrageous taboo - a reminder of the persecution that lesbians and gay men had suffered.  According to feminist scholar Sheila Jeffreys' book The Lesbian Heresy, a commotion unfolded in 1984 when a group of gay skinheads turned up at a gay bar in London's King's Cross and began sieg heiling. She also records that a well-known far-right youth organiser was thrown out of the same pub after taking off his jacket to reveal swastika tattoos.  A huge row erupted the following year at the London Lesbian and Gay Centre in King's Cross when a gay skinhead night was held at the venue.  It's not clear whether Crane was present at any of these incidents. But it appears that, at least initially, he was able to deflect questions about his politics by presenting himself on the gay scene as a skinhead first and foremost.  His friend Byrne, who describes himself as ""sort of more a Labour person"", had no time for the far-right element that had infiltrated the skinhead movement.  But Byrne was convinced at the time that Crane ""wasn't really a Nazi. It was all show"". The softly spoken Nicky he knew was too nice to be an extremist, Byrne believed.  This wasn't as fanciful as it might sound.  By the mid-1980s, a gay skinhead scene was beginning to flourish in London, says Murray Healy, author of Gay Skins: Class, Masculinity and Queer Appropriation.  Gay men had many different reasons for adopting the look, he says. Some had been skinheads before they came out. Others found that, in an era when all gay men were widely assumed to be camp and effeminate, ""you were less likely to get picked on if you looked like a queer-basher"". There were also ""fetish skins"", attracted to the ""hyper-masculinity"" of the subculture.  Against this backdrop, even the swastikas and racist slogans inked on Crane's body could be explained away, at least initially. During the 1980s, says Healy, ""gay Nazis were assumed to be left-wing even if they had Nazi tattoos"".  ""People refused to read these tattoos politically. People thought it was part of the authenticity ritual. People thought he was just playing a part.""  And indeed it wasn't just gay skins who flirted with the iconography of fascism. While ""redskins"" and ""Sharps"" - an acronym for Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice - confronted those with links to the far right, many heterosexual skinheads who were apolitical also adopted fascist garb, says Byrne.  ""A lot of skinheads that weren't right-wing used to wear Skrewdriver T-shirts,"" Byrne adds. ""It was about the fashion of being a skinhead.""  But Crane wasn't just playing with the imagery of Nazism. He was living it. His decision to start frequenting venues such as Heaven wasn't the only thing that had changed since before his sentence.  During the years 1981 to 1984, which he mostly spent incarcerated, his fame had grown far beyond the narrow confines of the far right.  In 1981, the journalist Garry Bushell helped put together a compilation album of tracks by bands from the burgeoning Oi! scene.  Oi!, a cheerfully crude sub-genre of punk, was popular with skinheads. Its politics were fairly broad - while there were right-wingers within its ranks, some of its most prominent acts, including the Angelic Upstarts, were avowed socialists. Others, such as the 4-Skins, condemned political extremism of all kinds.  That was to count for little after Bushell, desperate for a cover image after a photoshoot fell through, seized on a Christmas card which he says he believed showed a scene from the film The Wanderers. In fact, it was a picture of Crane.  It was only when the image was blown up to 12in cover size, Bushell says, that he noticed Crane's Nazi tattoos. Faced with the choice of airbrushing out his markings or pulling the release, the writer chose the former option.  ""It was a monumentally, cataclysmically stupid decision,"" he says. The title of the compilation was Strength Thru Oi! - which Bushell says was intended as a pun on Strength Through Joy, the title of a recent EP by punk act The Skids, but which in turn was borrowed from a Nazi slogan.  The Daily Mail seized upon the title and the connection with Crane, condemning the ""highly controversial"" record as ""evil"".  According to Bushell, who had only recently left the Socialist Workers Party and still regarded himself at the time as a left-winger, the story was a ""tissue of lies"". But as a result of the coverage, the hitherto obscure Oi! scene became associated by many with the far right - to the chagrin of acts featured on the album, such as the socialist poet Gary Johnson.  Crane's musical background had hitherto extended to starting fights at ska and punk gigs, plus a short-lived stint singing in a punk band called The Afflicted.  The notoriety, however, transformed him into a skinhead icon. The Strength Thru Oi! cover image - featuring a topless, muscle-bound Crane snarling and raising his boot - was widely reproduced in the wake of the row.  T-shirts featuring the image were sold at The Last Resort, a clothes shop favoured by skinheads in London's Whitechapel. They were a huge hit. Although the album was withdrawn from sale, reproductions of its cover adorned thousands of bedroom walls.  ""He was literally a poster boy,"" says Watson, who at the time was a teenage skin in Buckinghamshire. ""Even a 15-year-old was like, 'That's what a skinhead should look like.'  ""He just fell into our living rooms. These little kids in High Wycombe - we didn't know anything about the Nazi stuff.""  On the surface, the idea of a gay man embracing neo-Nazism might appear baffling and self-defeating. Just as Adolf Hitler's regime had thrown gays and lesbians into death camps, the neo-Nazi movement remained staunchly homophobic.  Crane was becoming all too aware of the contradiction of being a gay neo-Nazi. ""A lot of people that I did used to hang around with, they did sort of like hate us,"" he said in 1992 - ""us"" meaning gay men.  ""They'd go out queer-bashing. It's something I never did myself. And I'd never let it happen in front of me, either.""  He had, however, chosen fascism long before he had embraced his sexuality, and much of his social life and prestige was bound up with his status as a prominent neo-Nazi activist.  To maintain his cover, Crane would often appear in public with a skinhead girl on his arm. ""He often had a so-called girlfriend but they were never around for long,"" says Pearce. ""Nicky had no chemistry with girls.""  Certainly, after coming out, Crane always described himself as gay rather than bisexual.  Nonetheless, his relationships with women, coupled with rumours that he had fathered a son, allayed any initial suspicions his comrades might have had. So too did his propensity for racist violence.  On Sunday 10 June 1984, Greater London Council leader Ken Livingstone held a free open-air concert to protest against unemployment and government spending cuts.  Thousands of Londoners turned out to watch acts like The Smiths and Billy Bragg. Most would have been attracted principally by the music and the summer weather.  To Nicky Crane, however, anyone attending a left-wing-hosted event like this was a legitimate target.  As The Redskins, a socialist skinhead band, played, Crane led an attack on the crowd. Around 100 fascists began setting about the audience closest to the main stage.  ""They were organised, they were used to violence, the audience wasn't,"" says Gary, an anti-fascist activist who was present that day and asked to be identified only by his first name.  The neo-Nazis were beaten back by a group of striking Yorkshire miners, invited to steward the event by Livingstone as a solidarity gesture, and members of the militant far-left group Red Action.  Crane was not cowed, however, and after regrouping his forces, he charged a second stage at the other end of the park where the Hank Wangford Band were playing.  This time, however, the anti-fascists were better prepared. Militants grabbed empty cider bottles to use as improvised weapons.  As the anti-fascists fought back, Crane broke away from the main battle. ""He was busy attacking the rest of the crowd, on his own, stripped to the waist,"" says Gary.  As Crane tried to make it over a barrier on to the stage, he was knocked over by a Red Action member. He escaped the furious crowd by using a female left-wing activist as a human shield, according to witnesses.  As the violence subsided, anti-fascists confronted another skinhead in the crowd. His Harrington jacket was unzipped to reveal a slogan on his T-shirt. It read ""Nicky Crane"", in tribute to the young man's hero.  Given the carnage Crane had just instigated, the left-wingers had little sympathy for his admirer. The skinhead was set upon and beaten.  Crane was never prosecuted for his part in the riot.  In the febrile atmosphere of the mid-1980s, however, violence was everywhere.  As clashes between police and striking miners becoming increasingly bitter, football hooligans across the country were fighting it out with unprecedented ferocity. The formation of AFA in 1985 resulted in increasingly bloody stand-offs between anti-fascists and the far right.  Several years later, Crane told the Sun newspaper about an attack on a Jewish Remembrance Day ceremony for which he also appears to have escaped arrest.  ""We hurled insults at them and started punching and kicking as they went by,"" he admitted to the paper in 1992.  On another occasion, Crane and his gang spotted a left-wing activist on a Tube train. ""Me and a few mates beat him really badly,"" he said. ""Even though he wasn't moving we all kept jumping on his head.  ""I think he survived. It must have been a miracle.""  After the BM collapsed in 1983, Crane had become something of a free agent. He was a visible presence on demonstrations held by other far-right groups. These included the NF - now split into two warring factions - and the British National Party, formed in 1982 by John Tyndall, which had begun to attract a significant football hooligan following.  Among the rank and file of each group, Crane remained a hero.  ""You could very easily drop him into the Weimar Republic in 1923 and, some language difficulties apart, he'd fit right in,"" says Gary.  His closest affiliation, however, was with the neo-Nazi rock band Skrewdriver. Originally the group had been apolitical. In 1982, however, singer Ian Stuart Donaldson came out as a supporter of the National Front.  With song titles like Europe Awake and Flying the Flag, the group gained a huge following among far-right skinheads.  Opposition from anti-fascists meant gigs had to be forcefully stewarded. Donaldson appointed Crane as Skrewdriver's head of security, and he became a trusted lieutenant.  Reportedly, Crane wrote the lyrics for a Skrewdriver track called Justice and provided the cover art for the albums Hail The New Dawn and After The Fire.  Archive footage of their concerts shows Donaldson barking neo-Nazi lyrics as he loomed above Crane who stood, arms folded, at the front of the stage. The T-shirt on his chest said ""Skrewdriver security"" in Gothic script.  Crane wasn't playing an instrument, but it was as though he was part of the performance.  His status as a neo-Nazi icon had never been more secure. But for the first time, the twin strands of his double life were about to intersect.  The anti-fascist magazine Searchlight was, despite its political leanings, required reading for activists on the extreme right. Each month the publication would run gossip about the neo-Nazi scene, and fascists would furtively buy it to see whether they had earned a mention.  In April 1985 it ran a feature on Crane. It mentioned the GLC concert, the south London attacks and the jail sentences he had served. The magazine revealed it had received a Christmas card from him during his time on the Isle of Wight in which he proclaimed his continued allegiance to ""the British Movement tradition"" - that is, violence.  The Searchlight report ended its description of Crane with the line: ""On Thursday nights he can be found at the Heaven disco in Charing Cross.""  Even a neo-Nazi audience might have been aware that Heaven was at this point London's premier gay club. Nicky Crane had been outed. And homosexuality was anathema to neo-Nazis.  But the response of Crane's comrades to the revelation was to ignore it.  A number of factors allowed Crane to brush off the report, Pearce says. Firstly, homosexuality was indelibly associated with effeminacy by the far right, and Crane was the very opposite of effeminate.  Secondly, no-one wanted to be seen to believe Searchlight above the word of a committed soldier for the Aryan cause.  Thirdly, on the most basic level, everyone was afraid of being beaten up by Crane if they challenged him.  ""I remember it was just sort of furtive whispering,"" adds Pearce. ""I'm not aware that anyone confronted Nicky. People were happy for things to remain under the carpet.""  Sightings at gay clubs were dismissed by Crane.  Donaldson claimed Crane told him that he was obliged to take jobs at places like Heaven because the security firm he was employed by sent him there.  ""I accepted him at face value, as he was a nationalist,"" Donaldson told a fanzine years later.  For his part, Heaven's then-owner, Jeremy Norman, says he does not recall Crane working on the door: ""I would imagine that the door staff would have been supplied by a security contractor and that he would have been their employee but it is all a long time ago.""  Rumours circulated that a prominent football hooligan and far-right activist had hurled a homophobic slur at Crane, who in response had inflicted a severe beating which the victim was lucky to survive.  Word of this spread among the skinhead fraternity, too.  ""My mate had a shop in Soho,"" recalls Watson. ""People would come in to say, 'Have you heard Nicky's gay?' He would say, he works around the corner, why don't you go and ask him? Of course they never did.""  Just as some in the gay community refused to believe that a gay man could be a neo-Nazi, others on the extreme right were unable to acknowledge that a neo-Nazi could be a gay man.  In 1987 Crane and Donaldson set up a group called Blood & Honour. It was a cross between a White Power music club and a political party.  It staged concerts for Skrewdriver and other neo-Nazi bands with names like No Remorse and Brutal Attack. T-shirts, flags and records were sold by mail order through its magazine. The operation had an annual turnover of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Donaldson was its head, Crane his right-hand man and head of security.  Around the same time, the latter's organisational skills were being put to use elsewhere.  Searchlight reported in October 1987 that ""Crane, the right's finest example of a clinical psychopath, is also engaged in building a 'gay skins' movement, which meets on Friday nights"" at a pub in east London.  Crane's sexuality might by now have been obvious to any interested onlooker, but the neo-Nazi scene remained in denial.  While his right-wing colleagues studiously ignored the report, AFA took an interest. Its activists put the pub under surveillance.  The anti-fascists didn't care about Crane's sexuality, but were concerned that the gatherings might have a political objective. ""Here were gay skinheads wearing Nazi regalia,"" says Gary. ""We could never get to the bottom of it - whether it was purely a sexual fetish.""  The gay community had, by this stage, begun to take notice of Crane, too. He was confronted by anti-fascists attending a Pride rally in Kennington, south London, in 1986.  The campaigner Peter Tatchell recalls a row erupting after it emerged Crane had been allowed to steward a gay rights march. The organisers had not been aware who Crane was or what his political affiliations were.  But now they were, and Crane must have realised he would no longer be welcome in much of gay London. The gay skinhead night may simply have been an attempt to carve out a space for himself where he would not be challenged either for his sexuality or his politics.  While his status in the far right was secure, he was being pushed to the fringes of the gay community. The double life he had been maintaining was beginning to erode.  The Bloody Sunday commemoration rally was held every January to mark the deaths of 14 unarmed protesters at the hands of the Parachute Regiment in Derry in 1972.  For years the rally had been a target for the far right, whose sympathies in the Northern Ireland conflict mostly lay with the loyalists. So when Nicky Crane was spotted within the vicinity of the march in Kilburn, a traditionally Irish enclave of north-west London, in January 1990, it was assumed he had trouble in mind.  Crane was confronted by anti-fascist activists who were stewarding the event and, after a brief exchange of blows, he managed to get away.  But when he was spotted in a black cab heading back into the area, marchers took it as read that he was about to spearhead an ambush on the march.  After the taxi became stuck in traffic at the top of Kilburn High Road it was quickly surrounded.  Crane was pulled from the vehicle and found himself on the receiving end of the kind of violence he had long inflicted on others. After putting up fierce resistance, he was beaten unconscious.  Three anti-fascists were jailed for a total of 11 years for their part in the incident. Unusually for a political street fighter who deplored the system, Crane testified at their trial.  It was a hint that Crane was preparing to cut his ties with the extreme right.  ""I don't think he'd have done it in his fascist days, put it that way,"" says Gary. ""You didn't go to the police. Hard men don't do that, they sort it out among themselves.""  It was not the first indication that Crane was losing his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. In May 1989 he had fled when anti-fascists turned up to a meeting point in London's Hyde Park for a Blood & Honour gig.  After the Bloody Sunday march, there is no record of Crane taking part in any further political activity. He had begun drifting away from the extreme right.  Friends say he had begun spending an increasing amount of time in Thailand, where his past was not known and he could, for the first time since Strength Thru Oi! was released, be anonymous.  Back in London, he appeared in a series of skinhead-themed amateur gay porn videos. The films did not achieve wide circulation but, to star in them in the first place, he must have been indifferent to whether or not he was exposed.  Eventually he made a decision. It was time to end the double life once and for all.  The Channel 4 programme was called Out. It featured a series of documentaries about lesbian and gay life in the UK. The episode broadcast on 27 July 1992 was about the gay skinhead subculture. Its star attraction was Nicky Crane.  First the programme showed recorded interviews with an unwitting Donaldson, who sounded baffled that such a thing as gay skinheads existed, and NF leader Patrick Harrington.  And then the camera cut to Crane, in camouflage gear and Dr Martens boots, in his Soho bedsit.  He told the interviewer how he'd known he was gay back in his early BM days. He described how his worship of Hitler had given way to unease about the far right's homophobia.  He had started to feel like a hypocrite because the Nazi movement was so anti-gay, he said. ""So I just, like, couldn't stay in it."" Crane said he was ""ashamed"" of his political past and insisted he had changed.  ""The views I've got now is, I believe in individualism and I don't care if anyone's black, Jewish or anything,"" he added. ""I either like or dislike a person as an individual, not what their colour is or anything.""  The revelation attracted considerable press attention. The Sun ran a story with the headline ""NAZI NICK IS A PANZI"". Below it described the ""Weird secret he kept from gay-bashers"".  Crane reiterated that he had abandoned Nazi ideology. ""It is all in the past,"" he told the paper. ""I've made a dramatic change in my life.""  The reaction from his erstwhile comrades was one of horror and fury. Donaldson issued a blood-curdling death threat on stage at a Skrewdriver gig.  ""He's dug his own grave as far as I'm concerned,"" Donaldson told the Last Chance fanzine. ""I was fooled the same as everybody else. Perhaps more than everybody else. I felt I was betrayed by him and I want nothing to do with him whatsoever.""  But according to Pearce - who by this stage had made his own break with the NF - it was Crane's disavowal of National Socialism, rather than the admission of his sexuality, that proved particularly painful for Donaldson.  ""I think that Ian would have been very shocked,"" says Pearce. ""He was deeply hurt. But it had more to do with the fact that he switched sides politically.  ""Nicky didn't just come out as a homosexual, he became militantly opposed to what he previously believed in.""  British Nazism had lost its street-fighting poster boy. For the first time in his adult life, however, Crane was able to be himself.  Watson recalls catching a glimpse of Crane - by then working as a bicycle courier - shortly after he came out. ""I saw him riding around Soho in Day-Glo Lycra shorts,"" remembers Watson. ""I thought, good for you.""  On 8 December 1993, Byrne took the train to London. He had arranged to meet his friend Nicky Crane at Berwick Street market, just a few yards from his Rupert Street bedsit.  Byrne was looking forward to having ""a good old chat"" about skinheads they both knew. But Crane didn't turn up.  When Byrne got home, he found out why. Crane had died the day before. He was 35. The cause of death was given on his death certificate as bronchopneumonia, a fatal inflammation of the air passages to the lungs.  He was a victim of the disease that had killed so many other young gay men of his generation.  ""He didn't tell me about his problems with Aids,"" says Byrne. ""He didn't talk much about it really. I thought it was a shame.""  Word had got around that Crane was ill, however. Gary recalls his shock at seeing his one-time foe looking deeply emaciated, waiting on a platform at Baker Street Tube station. Crane's stature was such, however, that even at this point fellow passengers were careful to keep their distance.  Those who suffered as a result of his rampages may have breathed a sigh of relief that he was no longer able to terrorise them.  But his death marked more than just the end of Nicky Crane.  It also coincided with the passing of an era in which the extreme right hoped to win power by controlling the street with boots and fists.  In 1993, Crane was dead, Donaldson died in a car crash and the British National Party (BNP) won its first council seat in Millwall, east London. The various factions of the NF had by now all but withered.  The following year, BNP strategist Tony Lecomber announced there would be ""no more meetings, marches, punch-ups"" - instead, the intention now was to win seats in town halls. The party would try to rebrand itself as respectable and peaceful - a strategy continued, with varying success, under the leadership of Nick Griffin. Streetfighters like Nicky Crane were supposedly consigned to the past.  The broader skinhead movement was changing, too.  Watson, like many other former skins, had by the time of Crane's death, abandoned boots and braces for the rave scene. His skinhead days already felt like a different age.  ""The skinhead stuff was washed away by rave and it's, 'Oh yes, Nicky's out of the closet,'"" Watson says. ""It's the story of that side of skinheads, isn't it?""  By contrast, the presence of skinheads in gay clubs and bars was no longer controversial. Shorn of its political associations, the look was by now, if anything, more popular in London's Old Compton Street or Manchester's Canal Street than on football terraces or far-right rallies.  Two decades after Crane's death, says Healy, the skinhead is ""recognised as a gay man unambiguously in London and Manchester"". He adds: ""If the Village People reformed today there would be a skinhead in the group.""  He may be an extreme case, but Crane reflects an era in which people's expectations of what a gay man looked and behaved like began to shift.  ""Everybody always knew gay people, but they just didn't know it,"" says Max Schaefer, whose 2010 novel Children of the Sun features a character fascinated by Crane. ""The neo-Nazis were no different from everyone else.""  It's unlikely Crane reflected on his place at this intersection between all these late 20th Century subcultures. He was a man of action, not ideology - a doer who left the thinking to others, and this may be what led a confused, angry young man to fascism in the first place.  As he lingered in St Mary's hospital in Paddington, west London, waiting to die, a young man named Craig was at his side. Craig was ""one of Nicky's boyfriends"", says Byrne.  According to Crane's death certificate, Craig was with him at the end.  Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook"
353,"Ministers have agreed that public buildings should fly Scotland's Saltire flag on St Andrew's Day.  The Scottish Executive announced a review of an order which called for the Union Flag to be flown in preference to the country's national flag.  Scottish National Party MSP Mike Russell welcomed what he described as ""a rapid climbdown"".  But said the situation should never have arisen in the first place.  The row broke out after it emerged that Historic Scotland, which cares for 330 castles and historic properties, could not fly the Saltire on ""special"" days because of rules giving priority to the Union Flag.  Historic Scotland would normally fly its own flag - with the Saltire being preferred if there were two poles available.  However on days earmarked by the government, the Union Flag must be flown - effectively meaning that the Saltire could be displayed.  These dates include St Andrew's Day - 30 November - the Queen's birthday and her official birthday, Commonwealth Day and even the Queen's wedding anniversary.  Mr Russell said it was ""bizarre"" that the Saltire could not be flown on Scotland's national day.  He tabled parliamentary questions about the matter, saying that he hoped ""this forelock tugging madness"" would be quickly overturned.  He warned: ""If not Scotland will become the laughing stock of the world - the only nation in which our government is too ashamed of its own country to allow its own flag to fly.""  But the executive insisted that the ""guidance"" was being changed as part of a review that was already taking place even before Monday's disclosure.  A spokesman said: ""The first minister and deputy first minister believe that public buildings should fly the Saltire on St Andrew's Day, and they will make it clear in the review.""  ""The executive will also actively encourage the flying of the Saltire on public buildings on St Andrew's Day.""  The ban arose from guidance issued by the government's Department of Culture, Media and Sport.  Historic Scotland said: ""We are required, in common with all other government buildings in Scotland, and in line with Scottish ministers' policy, to fly the Union flag on 'special' days.  ""Where there is one flagpole, the union flag is flown.  ""Where there are two flagpoles, the Union Flag and the house flag are flown."""
354,"Belfast City Council says environmental health officers have visited a Belfast city centre café to ensure it was closed and to offer advice after a video was taken of rats on the counter.  It shows the rodents inside a branch of Caffè Nero in Donegall Square West, beside Belfast City Hall.  A Caffè Nero spokeswoman said the firm had begun an ""urgent investigation"".  The council said its officers also examined drains in the area on Wednesday morning.  The footage of the rats was obtained by the Belfast Telegraph.  It was filmed by a couple who spotted the rats as they passed the shop at about 01:30 BST on Tuesday, 7 July.  The couple, who did not want to be named, said they were on their way home from a night out in the city centre and were ""shocked"" by the sight of rats inside the shop.  One of the pair, a 24-year-old man from Belfast, told the newspaper: ""We couldn't get a taxi so we decided to walk through town to get to a taxi depot.  ""It was out of the corner of my eye I noticed one rat on the floor and then eventually another one, and I watched them climb up the counter top and in behind the coffee machine. Then I started recording it.  ""I couldn't believe it in such a well-known brand. I was quite shocked and stunned. That's why I started recording it, because I didn't think anyone would believe it,"" the man added.  The coffee shop was closed on Wednesday morning, and a sign said the closure was due to ""essential maintenance"".  In a statement to the BBC, Caffè Nero's spokeswoman said: ""Following this isolated incident, and in line with our industry leading practices, we have closed the affected store and launched a full and urgent investigation.  ""We are working closely with Belfast City Council and relevant contractors to eradicate the source of the problem, which we believe to be a disused building adjacent to our store.""  Belfast City Council said as well as visiting the premises, its officers also investigated ""the integrity of the external drainage infrastructure in the area and were liaising with the management of the Scottish Provident Building who carried out immediate maintenance to the drainage"".  It added: ""There were no reports of any rodent activity in any of the food businesses.  ""We understand that the video highlighted by the media was taken some weeks ago; instances of this nature are best reported to the council immediately in order for us take action in a timely manner.""  Food hygiene inspections are the responsibility of local authorities in Northern Ireland, and the latest available inspection report for the Donegall Square West branch was carried out on 22 January this year.  The inspectors from Belfast City Council had awarded the coffee shop a food hygiene rating of four out of a maximum of five, meaning they considered the business to have a ""good"" rate of hygiene.  The Caffè Nero brand was founded in London in 1997 and specialises in Italian coffee.  The company now has a total of more than 600 stores in the UK, Turkey, Poland and Cyprus and the Middle East.  It operates from five locations in Belfast city centre."
355,"Hawks are being used to scare seagulls and pigeons away from Brighton & Hove Albion's new £93m ground.  The club said the birds of prey would deter pigeons from nesting and help keep the Amex stadium clean.  Operations manager Richard Hebberd said the birds would be brought in at regular intervals.  He said: ""They just scare everything in their territory so after a while the pigeons and the seagulls learn to not go to a particular location.""  Since they left the Goldstone Ground in 1997, the club have been without a permanent home.  But after sharing with Gillingham and then using the Withdean athletics stadium, they kicked-off the season in the Championship at the Amex stadium on Saturday."
356,"Italy completed a superb fightback to knock Japan out of the Confederations Cup and book their place in the semi-finals in a hugely entertaining game.  Japan went 2-0 up via Keisuke's Honda's penalty and Shinji Kagawa's strike.  But Italy responded in some style when Daniele De Rossi headed in before Atsuto Uchida's own goal and Mario Balotelli's penalty made it 3-2.  Japan equalised through Shinji Okazaki and also hit the woodwork, before Sebastian Giovinco sealed it for Italy.  Alberto Zaccheroni's Japan side could be justified in feeling the result in Recife was harsh on them.  Having surrendered a two-goal lead, then recovered from going behind to bring the scores level again after 69 minutes, they saw Okazaki and Kagawa hit post and bar respectively with eight minutes left.  ""Japan were truly terrific and deserved to win but fair play to Italy for showing resilience to come back and win the game. ""Keisuke Honda is on a free transfer, wow, there will be a number of clubs after him. What a competition and what a game - the match of the tournament so far.""  So when Giovinco - a first-half substitute for Alberto Aquilani in an opening period dominated by Asia's champions - popped up to tuck in Claudio Marchisio's cross four minutes from time it was a crushing blow for the team that had showed the greater enterprise over 90 minutes.  The result ends Japan's involvement here but the Brazilian crowd lapped up their quick passing and movement and will welcome them back to next year's World Cup, for which they have already qualified.  Ultimately Cesare Prandelli's earned the win through a ruthlessness Japan could not match, and they join Brazil in the last four as qualifiers from Group A. But they struggled to begin with as Manchester United's Kagawa - a potential star of next year's global showpiece - created countless problems for the normally resolute Italian backline.  Japan looked a completely different side to the one that lost to Brazil in their opening match, their passing fluid and their tempo higher than the Italians.  The breakthrough was a gift, however, as Mattia De Sciglio left his backpass short and Gianluigi Buffon was adjudged, perhaps harshly, to have brought down Okazaki. The keeper was shown a yellow card and Honda scored the spot-kick.  With Italy being outplayed, Giovinco's early introduction was an attempt to give more balance to Prandelli's side. But Kagawa gave Japan the more emphatic lead they deserved when he fired in a shot after the Italian defence failed to deal with Yasuyuki Konno's looping ball into the box.  De Rossi was then booked - he will miss the final group game against Brazil - as the Italians looked in danger of falling apart. But out of nowhere, the Roma midfielder led a surprising Italian turnaround before the break.  First, he headed in Andrea Pirlo's corner after 41 minutes, before Emanuele Giaccherini hit the post in first-half stoppage time. And five minutes after the interval Italy got the equaliser they sought when Uchida knocked the ball into his own net after Giaccherini's persistence.  The Azzurri's revival continued when Argentine referee Diego Abal awarded a second contentious spot-kick, penalising Japan captain Makoto Hasebe for a handball despite the ball bouncing off the floor to hit him from Giaccherini's shot.  Balotelli produced his customary stuttering run-up then stroked Italy into a scarcely credible lead.  But in sweltering conditions, the Italians seemed to fade again and paid the price when Okazaki nodded home Yasuhito Endo's free-kick as the game swung once more.  Japan were inches away from winning it as Buffon's goal led a charmed life, but Giovinco added the final twist as Italy rejoiced.  Even then Japan almost equalised again but Maya Yoshida's effort was ruled out for offside after Okazaki's shot had come back off the bar.  Italy coach Cesare Prandelli: ""Tonight we really, really struggled. We need to deal with the climate, it's really difficult. But I liked the way we suffered. We could have felt satisfied with ourselves but instead we wanted the win.""

357,"About 14,000 people have fled Ivory Coast to neighbouring Liberia following last month's disputed Ivorian presidential election, the UN says.  It says it is prepared for a total of 30,000 refugees in the region.  Most of those fleeing are supporters of Alassane Ouattara, who is recognised internationally as the new president.  Three West African presidents will go to Ivory Coast on Tuesday to personally urge incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo to quit, Benin's foreign minister says.  Mr Gbagbo has rejected widespread calls to step down, citing vote rigging in northern areas.  The spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), Fatoumata Lejeune-Kaba, told the BBC that most of those who had left Ivory Coast since the 28 November election had come from villages in the west of the country.  She said they had been walking for days to escape tensions they feared could explode into violence, and the flow was continuing.  A UNHCR statement added: ""With their numbers growing, the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them.""  Benin's Foreign Minister Jean Marie Ehouzou has said the presidents of Benin, Sierra Leone and Cape Verde will visit Ivory Coast to tell Mr Gbagbo on behalf of regional bloc Ecowas ""that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force"".  He was echoing a warning on Friday from West African leaders of possible military action.  Mr Gbagbo's government said the threat was unjust. It also condemned a decision by the West African central bank to give control of Ivory Coast's account to Mr Ouattara.  Earlier Mr Ouattara urged the armed forces to protect civilians against attack from ""the militias and foreign mercenaries that are spilling Ivorian blood"".  He said perpetrators of recent violence would be prosecuted and invited investigators from the International Criminal Court to the country.  Mr Ouattara and his cabinet are based at a hotel in the main city, Abidjan, under the protection of UN troops.  Mr Gbagbo has demanded that UN and French troops leave the country. A close ally even warned that they could be treated as rebels if they did not obey the instruction.  The UN, which has 10,000 peacekeepers in the country, rejected the call.  UN officials say at least 170 people have been killed in recent attacks linked to the Ivorian armed forces, who remain publicly loyal to Mr Gbagbo.  There have been suggestions that member nations send in troops to strengthen the presence of the UN peacekeeping force.  The election was meant to unite the country after a civil war in 2002 split the world's largest cocoa producer in two, with the predominantly Muslim North supporting Mr Ouattara and the mainly Christian south backing Mr Gbagbo."
358,"Animal rights activists are urging a boycott of the Grand National after five horses died on the famous Aintree racecourse this week. The RSPCA insist the course was in top condition and officials described the deaths as ""freak occurrences"" and a ""statistical blip"". But animal rights campaigners will be picketing betting shops to highlight what they see as an event that promotes ""suffering and death"". Will you be placing a bet on this Saturday's race? Do you think accidents like this are an accepted consequence of the sport, or do you think it's unnecessary to subject the horses to what some consider to be a dangerous course? No, I will never bet on a horse-race or any event where animals are being put at risk for the pure ""pleasure of sport"" of some group of people who think it is a ""noble"" sport. Not to mention the course itself; injury, even death, cannot be prevented and therefore this ""sport"" is no less barbaric then fox-hunting...another sport of this great species we call ""Homo sapiens"" or ""wise man"". Not really...    Wouter Verheul, Netherlands    I think it is unfair to suggest that people who are committed to animal rights do not care about human beings who are suffering.    Firstly, I think it is unfair to suggest that people who are committed to animal rights do not care about human beings who are suffering. Most people have room in their heads to feel compassion for more than one species. Personally, I believe that these events should be modified to minimise the risk to horses, rather than banned. Secondly, I believe that those who condemn ALL jockeys and suggest that they do not care for their horses are also being grossly unfair. I once taught I.T. skills to jockeys, who were nearing the end of their careers and, believe me, they were very committed to the safety and well being of the horses in their care.    Bella, UK Everyone should look at ""Grif-Canada"" comments as most people seem to be miss informed. The Grand National claimed no horse fatalities this year. Furthermore a certain horse which unseated it's rider at the fourteenth fence (before the stable entrance) decided to finish the race itself - riderless and jumped every fence thereafter. This to me doesn't seem like an animal that is not enjoying himself. A horse does not do what it is told and if it doesn't want to jump a fence it will not do so. Perhaps people should become more informed on this subject before commenting about it.    Dick Casey, Hong Kong What if five jockeys had died? What of all the calls to ban boxing? At least the boxers can make their own choice. It is time such primitive barbaric behaviour was outlawed. This is the 21st. Century after all. I am perturbed that the British RSPCA makes excuses for these alleged human beings. Penalties for all forms of animal cruelty are far too lenient and must be increased.    D.A.Mbange, Australia    When a parent takes a child for a ride in the car, that child's life is at risk. Are we to believe that the parent holds no love for the child?    I strongly disagree with those who say that jockeys wouldn't risk the lives of the horses if they loved them. When a parent takes a child for a ride in the car, that child's life is at risk. Are we to believe that the parent holds no love for the child? I am personally not interested in horse racing, yet I am appalled by the number comments posted here that are based on little more than vague emotion with no bearing on the event, people who obviously know even less than I do! I bet they shrug off news that 350 people died in an earthquake but are horrified when a dog has been killed in a road accident.    Daniel, England Where were all the protesters before the Aintree meetings? As always it is clueless people latching onto whatever is shown to them on the news. Do any of these people ever have their own opinions before being spoon fed by the media?    Steven, UK Are we all going soft - its all pathetic, we will soon be stopped from walking because it causes unnecessary harm to insects.    Dawson, UK Let's take a look at Boxing; A few individuals lose their lives or are seriously injured over the course of many decades and there's so much uproar that the rules are changed to the point where we now rarely see an actual 'Knock-down' as the fight is usually stopped in the name of 'Safety' before it reaches that point. Hundreds of horses have died for other peoples entertainment over the past few decades and to this day continue to do so... They haven't yet lowered the fences one-inch. The poor things don't even have the choice of whether or not they want to compete.    Wayne Brannan, UK I feel that the Steeplechase should definitely be banned. What gives human beings the right to gamble with horses knowing that it endangers their lives? It is incredibly cruel to still have the Steeplechase even after so many horses have died as a result of human entertainment. No one should play with life- even if it is that of an animal.    Deborah Robert, South Africa    Steeplechasing is not cruel, its glorious.    Steeplechasing is not cruel, its glorious. Nobody (bar some dimwit owners) goes into racing with the sole intent of making money, without regard for the horse. Its the poor activists who cannot see that the thrilling uncertainty of the chase is wonderful thing. And don't tell me nobody asked the horse - have you every tried to move a couple of hundred pounds of recalcitrant flesh that wasn't having it?    Craig Harry, England I can't believe the ignorance in this column. People can choose whether to box, play rugby etc. The horses do not have a choice. Why is it assumed that we have the right to force other creatures to entertain us when this often results in needless suffering for these other creatures. Do people have automatic rights over animals simply because we are more intelligent? Extending this argument should intelligent people automatically have rights over less intelligent people? The whole distinction between people and ""dumb"" animals is ridiculous.    Sean Taylor, US (Brit ex-pat) In response to Steve Porter of Northern Ireland. Animal activists are not in the business of making martyrs or heroes from dead horses, their aim is to keep them alive and happy hence the objection to the Grand National!!!    Yasmin, England What would have happened if it had been 5 Jockeys that had died?    Sarah, England    You can't tell a half ton of horse to rest whilst it's broken leg mends and trying to treat any serious injury can in itself lead to death through inactivity.    I am a qualified vet with additional interests and training in animal psychology. What these anthropomorphic's seem to forget is that there are far more cruel things you can do to any animal than put it to sleep. You can't tell a half ton of horse to rest whilst it's broken leg mends and trying to treat any serious injury can in itself lead to death through inactivity - horses' digestive and respiratory systems were not designed to cope with slings or forced 'bed rest'. Thousands of animals are put to sleep each year because it is the best thing for them, to 'put them out of their misery'. Horses break legs through accidents - it's no one's intention that they do so and, having served on racecourses, I can tell you that it is an incredibly sad thing for everyone except the horse.    Tessa Jones, England I have worked with horses for many years in many different aspects but NOT racing! I personally believe that it is a cruel sport - some argue that the horses are bred for it but surely not for the size of the Aintree fences? The world of racing, flat or jumping, is a hard one for the horse - they are no longer an animal but a commodity that can be abused and when necessary replaced with a hefty insurance payout. They are involved in the changing hands of vast sums of money for gambling, breeding and plain prestige this obviously leads to cruelty due to the high stakes and this most magnificent of animals becomes just a lump of MEAT. Please, if nothing else, ban The 'Grand' National    Hilary, UK Has anyone asked the horses! Seriously, steeple chasing is dangerous and should be banned or at least the jumps reduced to save horses' lives. Would we ask humans to give their lives jumping over fences?    Nick Bishop, England The use of animals in such a manner is barbaric and blatantly inhumane.    Scott Campbell, USA Banning steeplechases is all very well, but what do you think would happen to all the horses suddenly left without anything to do? Do you think the owners would keep them on through the goodness of their hearts? Do you think the trainers (now suddenly out of work) could afford to? Hardly. What you would end up with would be one of the largest gluts of horsemeat that the meat market has ever known. I'm not convinced that this is an improvement on one or two horses dying in a year.    Sarah Blake, UK    It is a barbaric sport, ""enjoyed"" by people who are only in it for their own financial gain.    It should definitely be banned. It is a barbaric sport, ""enjoyed"" by people who are only in it for their own financial gain. Most racehorses (if they survive the racing) end up as dog food, only a small percentage enjoy a relaxing retirement. It is just another typical example of people's greed, another ""Good old British tradition"", simply disgusting!    Mariska van Geelen, UK (Dutch) Before all, it isn't just sport, but unique social event and business. Behind this business are powerful persons with their passion for entertainment and money...    Peter Kaukov, Canada 5 horses died before the Grand National this week. That is disgusting. Any 'sport' which results in animals dying for human pleasure should be banned. This includes hunting AND the steeplechase.    Benj'min Mossop, Britain All animal races are not sports, they should not be glorified with the term sport.    Leigh, England    Horses enjoy running and physical exercise, but steeplechasing is an unnatural activity.    Do horses enjoy racing much? I'm not convinced that they all do as much as claimed. Where is the evidence? It won't do to say ""if you have worked with horses, it's obvious"". I HAVE worked with horses and studied their behaviour closely over many years - I don't think it is so obvious. It seems to me they are doing what they are bred and trained to do. Given the choice, I think they would prefer to spend their time munching grass with other horses. They do enjoy running and physical exercise, but steeplechasing is a rather unnatural activity, don't you think?  Francis Burton, Scotland Horses die from accident and injury in any equestrian sport. Flat racers have had a heart attack and some have broken legs stumbling. The national is a hard race and accidents will happen. They are always sad but that is no reason to ban it.  Kelv, England Outrageous that 5 horses have to die in the name of steeplechasing. Out of 40 horses that started yesterday, only 17 made it to the finish line. It seems that Britain is like Rome in the old days, the more casualties, the more exiting it is. What would have happened if 5 jockeys had died?  Susan van Lennep, USA One more time, human beings have proven ourselves to be heartless and outrageously selfish. It is unconscionable that this race continues and should be banned immediately along with regular horse racing!    Enid Breakstone, US How many activists can remember the horses who died in the race? I, like most fans of the National remember all their names. They are heroes in my eyes. Horses like Alverton, Eudipe, Dark Ivy & Beau Bob. To activists they are merely dumb animals. The race fan who remembers those who have been lost or the activist who is simply looking for another way to rebel against authority?  Steve Porter, Northern Ireland Britain has so many great sports that do not involve animals eg football, athletics, etc. Horse racing is purely for gambling purposes and is not even a real sport. Let's make the 21st century the age of compassion.  Richard Rosson, UK It's hard when you care about animals, to see them injured or killed, and I do think the National could be modified to make the jumps less hazardous while still maintaining its status as the world's premier steeplechase. Why shouldn't people care equally for humans and animals?  Susie, Scotland Some of the arguments on this site are so misguided, that they are worthless. Four horses lost their lives on Thursday, one in a race that uses one circuit of the 'National' fences, one over normal Steeplechase fences, one over hurdles (small fences) and one of a heart attack after completing the race and walking back to unsaddle. On Friday there was another fatality, by coincidence, also the first fence in a race using one circuit of the 'National' fences. This fence is actually one of the smallest, but as it is the first, they probably approach it a little to quickly. As far as I know, there were no fatalities in the Grand National today.  Griff., Canada Make the jumps lower. It's the obvious answer.  Andrew Daniels, England Motor vehicles kill and maim untold numbers of animals and people. Why not ban them all? In my experience, if a horse does not enjoy jumping, you might make a jumper out of him, but you won't go far. Certainly not to the level of a Grand National mount.  V. Wiseman, USA/UK It's sad five horses have died in two days at Aintree. Would someone tell me how many people died over the same period in car crashes or of smoking related illness. Then let's focus this outpouring of indignation on reducing this senseless waste of human life before we ban horse racing et al. What a difference we could make if we cared as much about PEOPLE as we appear to care about animals.  Richard P, England I like to strap these so-called jockeys onto motorcross bikes with the throttle wide open and but them on a track with unexpected sheer drops and water pits. See if they enjoy it, and you can bet it will happen if you can bet on it. Freedom for horses, in the new millennium horses should not be ridden at all.  Fat Bob, Northampton, UK The Grand National has high fences because the organisers know that only the best horses will manage to get over them, even then though they can't say an accident will not happen. I look at it this way. Horses are dying because of a human pastime. Not for food or clothing, but like bull fighting, for enjoyment. That can't be right. Yes keep the flat racing, but don't let the animals die because you like a flutter.    Tony Martin, UK I think this is similar to the case of speeding drivers occasionally killing people by selfishly driving too fast... It seems the love of money and selfish entertainment are considered more important the horses own suffering and lives. This is just yet another example of our so-called 'Caring' Society!    Adrian Paul Miles, Birmingham, England, UK I don't think horse racing of any form should be banned but surely the courses could be safer for the animals involved?    Richard Phillips, UK If the media would ignore such extremism, there would be nothing to get all upset about. I guess they have never seen a jockey fly over the horse because THE HORSE decided not to jump.    Ron K, USA    I wonder how, we can justify such racing, which has the potential of life threatening injuries for both jockeys and horses.    Yes, steeple chasing should be banned. When I was growing up in West Derby, Liverpool, my parents took me to the Grand National. I can still vividly recall the sight of a horse stumbling and falling at a nearby jump. Race officials subsequently came and shot the horse. The incident happened close to where we were seated. I remember crying and burying my face in my father's chest. Both then and now, I wonder how, we can justify such racing, which has the potential of life threatening injuries for both jockeys and horses.    Pat van der Veer, Canada John from England is talking rubbish. The whole point of protecting 'dumb' animals is to demonstrate that we have evolved enough not to cause pain to others, including animals. The horses do not have the choice.    Andrew, England    I am not in favour of banning racing completely, but it should be made much safer.    I don't believe that trainers, jockeys or even owners really love their horses, no more than they would love a car. I watch the jockeys riding in races and it is apparent to me, that the determination to be first past the post, overrules the feelings and consideration for the 'live animal' they are riding. The Grand National has always been a cruel race, but I feel that now with the fences becoming bigger, the horses and jockeys who are entered are not experienced enough for this race. I am an animal lover and in particular a horse lover, having owned one in the past. I am not in favour of banning racing completely, but it should be made much safer.    Irene Walsh, England Why? If steeplechases were banned then there would be a lot less horses in this country - fact. If animals are of no use to mankind they rapidly go extinct - fact (though unpleasant). Horses enjoy racing - fact. Animal rights activists need to think what will happen as a result of their demands - Fat chance of that though.    Richard Mottershead, UK Yesterday's deaths, dismissed as 'unfortunate accidents' by those horse-racing fanatics who care not one iota for horses but for the money involved, were sickening. What is worse is that they reveal the depth to which the British are utter hypocrites when it comes to animal 'rights'. We deplore other countries' obvious abuses of animals for public entertainment, yet we continue to subject our horses, that most elegant of creatures, to a merciless frenzy which results in them breaking their backs, necks and legs. The whole thing is grotesque.    Steven Eke, England    Where will this banning things stop?    The horses, which race at this level, are loved and looked after like few other animals we keep. They love the racing as much as the jockeys and spectators - you know that if you've ridden in a race - and those that do not love racing don't get to a top. Where will this banning things stop?    Peter, UK The self-righteous zealots of the Western world have found a new refuge in animal rights and similar ""causes"". It makes them feel important. Eat some steak, have a bet, and ignore them.    S. Thomas, Australia If you are going to ban fox hunting, you have to ban all sports that involve animals. The animals do not know it's a sport, they are following an instinct to chase or to flee. You have to look at where we want to go with banning animal sports as a country and as the globe in general. I noticed in the news that the Tiger is close to being wiped out again. How many species do WE have to destroy to learn!    Steven Robinson, England To ban the steeple chase would be as stupid as banning boxing, but I do feel that if what I heard about the national (that ditches have been deepened and fences raised) is true, I think that this too is idiocy. The idea should be to have as little risk to the horses as possible. Doing this only endangers the horses even further.    Trevor Blayney, N. Ireland If steeplechases are banned in horse racing what implications will this have for the human version of the sport. Should the Olympic Steeplechase event be stopped also?    Darryl Barber, UK What is most horrifying, regardless of the alleged safety of steeplechases, is the despicable way in which the lives of horses are terminated and discarded in the most off-hand manner when the animal is unfortunate enough to have an accident. As has been said on this forum: ""one favourite for the National was put down following a training accident last week"". Perhaps if I were to break my wrist and be unable to sit at this computer and do my job, I too should be terminated without delay, as though the further maintenance of my life were a burden that no longer deserved to be met?    Michael Kilpatrick, UK Whilst the death of the horses during the recent races is a tragedy, it has always happened, and will happen again. Complete banning of the sport just isn't a viable idea. What is viable however, is the introduction of much more 'horse friendly' jumps. This would help to ensure less fatalities whilst not detracting an enormous amount from the quality of the overall racing spectacle.    Jon Evans, England    It sickens me that the weirdoes in the animal rights lobby grab the headlines because four dumb animals have died.    In a week when two human beings have been murdered in Turkey it sickens me that the weirdoes in the animal rights lobby grab the headlines because four dumb animals have died. It's time they realised that rights are counter balanced by responsibilities. As animals cannot accept responsibility for they have no rights.    John, England I think the Grand National should be changed. If you look at how many horses actually complete the race each year, it's about 30%. (Usually 40 or so runners, of which 10 - 15 complete it). It would be better to lower the height of some of the really tough jumps so that more horses complete the race. More importantly, there'd be less casualties, too. The sheer distance is a good enough challenge.    Mark, UK. The key to all this is in the word Race horse. Horses like this were bred, raised and trained to race. Without racing there would be no racehorse, which I am sure the animal rights lobby would find equally disagreeable.   Every person on the race track or in any way interested in racing would have been upset yesterday will have been upset by the four deaths. However while every precaution and safety measure was in place to minimise the risks, there will always be an element of danger.   Sports such as Rugby, boxing, skiing, motor sports are surely a more fitting target to ban on safety grounds.    Sean, UK The real dangers lie in Steeplechases - hurdling and flat racing are relatively safe for horse and rider. The National is yet another Festival of Greed - which the UK is becoming very good at. Sport it is not!    Alasdair C, Scotland Jockeys have a choice. Horses don't. End of argument.    TJ, Ye Old Merry England Watch the race on Saturday and see how many riderless horses continue to run and jump even without a jockey. Then tell me, with a straight face, that the Grand National is cruel and unnatural for horses.    Richard P, England    The death of one horse at such a public event is bad enough, but to lose four is appalling.    I was extremely upset to hear of yesterday's deaths. I appreciate that the Grand National is an extremely well loved event and that many people who have no real interest in horse racing enjoying watching the National. However, the death of one horse at such a public event is bad enough, but to lose four is appalling.   I like many others do not want to see the race banned but do feel strongly that the course should be altered, either by redesigning the jumps and shortening the length of the course.    Claire, UK There is nothing ""grand"" about a race that each year claims innocent equine lives. The whole racing industry is based on money and not the love of horses.    Vikki Martin, Essex, England    Horses do not run or jump if they do not want to - it's a simple as that.    Having worked with horses for several years and seen several occasions where they have suffered fatal injuries simply galloping around their own exercise paddock, I am frequently irritated by the obsessive ramblings of a group of people (animal rights activists) who insist on interfering with issues about which they know absolutely nothing. Horses do not run or jump if they do not want to - it's a simple as that.   We get to this situation every year during Grand National week, purely because it is one of the most famous and publicised races in the world - I would prefer to see these animal rights activists spending more time lobbying for stiffer penalties for those people who abuse, neglect and appallingly mistreat animals rather than pointing their fingers at those who love and respect the noble qualities of the Thoroughbred.    Heather Nash, UK It is now an unfortunate occurrence in today's society that we value life bellow that of sport. With the tragic deaths in mid-week of the two Leeds supporters and now the Grand National claims another four horses.    David Ashcroft, UK    I don't believe animals should be made to suffer and die for our entertainment.    Far too many horses are killed in horse racing, especially in steeplechasing. Sadly it is not just those that are killed dramatically on the course that die. Many more suffer less obvious injuries which result in them being destroyed later as they are not fit to race anymore.   I would never bet on any race as I don't believe animals should be made to suffer and die for our entertainment.    Lynne Mitchell, Scotland I go to Goodwood once a year - as often as I get to hear about a fatality in the world of horse racing. Surely four horses being killed on one day IS exceptional, not the norm and shouldn't be blown up out of proportion. It is a tough course, but should we really be making such a fuss.   If large numbers of horses and/or jockeys were being injured every week then maybe a rethink of the course design would be necessary. Oh and yes I do have a bet on for the race tomorrow - a sweepstake at work - the name of the horse is unpronounceable so I won't be doing much ""come on...""    Nicola Jardes, UK Every year it's the same...4...5...6...7...8 horses seem to die during Aintree week. It would be daft to ban steeplechasing though because the horses seem to enjoy it (they wouldn't run if they didn't), but maybe we'll have to think about decreasing the jumps or the size of the field.   I can think of nothing more upsetting to a family day out at the races than children having to witness the bodies of dead horses.    Jill Baird, Scotland    It is just a sport and entertainment that is healthy for the horses and is good fun and enjoyment for the jockeys.    I think steeplechase should not be banned because it is just a sport and entertainment that is healthy for the horses and is good fun and enjoyment for the jockeys the accidents that happen are just unfortunate and like many sports it is not always safe to take part.But I still don't think it should be banned because it could ruin the history of horse racing.    Emily McCarthy, England I was stationed in the UK in the early fifties when Princess Margaret had an entry, considered by many to be a favourite in the Grand National, a mare named Monoveen, as I remember. She went down in the race and had to be put down.   I have long criticised this race. Racing fans have told me of at least one race in which they all went down and the race was won by a remounted jockey. This is cruelty to an animal species which has aided mankind's development immeasurably before the era of motorization. They should not be mistreated nor eaten.    Steve Block, USA It took some time, but F1 drivers fought, and as a result, the tracks are much safer and it is now rare to hear that a driver has died in a crash. Unfortunately, horses can't tell us how they feel about the courses. Although I suspect that the prospect of running some of theses courses does not thrill them. All things evolve and maybe its time to examine theses courses and change some aspects so that they are humane to all participants. All things in moderation.    V. Cancara, Canada I am not a great follower of horse racing, but I do like to watch the really big events. I rate the grand national as an awesome spectacle and find that it would be a shame to lose so much tradition over freak accidents. I would appreciate it if the protesters would rather find something else to do with their time, maybe work would be good idea!!    Tomas Bezuidenhout, South Africa    It would be a shame to lose so much tradition over freak accidents.    You may not have noticed that one of the horses who died yesterday fell in a hurdle race, not a steeplechase. Hurdling is faster, the jumping flatter and more damage can be done to horse and rider in a fall. The most dangerous fall is one on the flat because of the relative speed. One of the favourites for the National was put down following a training accident last week. If you want to ban steeplechases, you would have to look at banning all horse racing and rid the country of one of its most popular, famous and prestigious sports. Two football fans were stabbed to death - does anyone talk of banning football?    Jenni, UK Most of the people involved in the industry are devoted to the welfare of the horses. I grew up in an area famous for training National winners. The feelings of compassion for the injured horses are felt strongest by those who care for the horses day-in, day-out.    Jim, UK Like most debates about the country, the negative voices will be the loudest, and one can bet that they will be shouted from the rooftops of the city. Horse racing has always had tragic losses, and the loss of a couple of great old campaigners yesterday in Lake Kariba and Strong Promise is particularly sad. However the National Hunt is continually looking for ways to make the sport safer for the horses and jockeys alike, and Aintree is a much safer course today than it has ever been. However, there are bound to be those in this Talking Point that rely on sentiment and limited understanding of the facts proclaiming the viciousness of this sport and the terrible cruelty.    Anon, UK    Two football fans were stabbed to death - does anyone talk of banning football?    I really have to disagree with animal rights activists on this point. First of all I don't want people to dismiss this argument as old school rhetoric, I'm all for the banning of foxhunting and rabbit coursing but horse racing and steeplechases are not cruel or unusual punishment but generally a form of safe and healthy exercise that benefits both horse and owner. Horses are treated with the care and respect they deserve and held in great affection by their owners.    Michael Carey, N.Ireland Jockeys, trainers and the owners all claim they have a love for the horses. Would one really risk the lives of the ones they love? I suggest the love lies in money rather than the horses.    Steve Park, England I think that races such as the Grand National are abhorrent and should be banned. Anyone who thinks this is entertainment and enjoyable need to take a long hard look at the risks these horses take in pursuit of your ""entertainment"". Personally, rather than run the Grand National, why don't they just walk down the start line with a loaded gun and have a game of Russian Roulette?    mel, UK    Rather than run the Grand National, why don't the jockeys just walk down the start line with a loaded gun and have a game of Russian Roulette?    I have felt for many years that steeplechases should be banned - it is obscene that animals should die for the sake of our so called 'entertainment'. We banned bear baiting and other forms of cruelty to animals for 'entertainment' many years ago - why has this been allowed to go on? Because there is so much money tied up in it would be my answer, and as we all know 'Money talks' unfortunately.    .Jean McCarthy, England Can you imagine the inquiry that would result if four athletes in an Olympic event, died in the race? Would that be accepted as a ""statistical blip""? I suspect if it were four jockeys who had died, the course officials would be a little less complacent in their explanation. Whoever called this a statistical blip, clearly doesn't understand statistics.    Nige, UK"
359,"At least 11 people were killed and more than 70 injured when an earthquake shook parts of northern Afghanistan, officials say  The Samangan province deputy governor said the quake hit just before midnight local time on Sunday.  Samangan is 190km (120 miles) north-west of the capital Kabul and the same distance from Mazar-e-Sharif city.  The 5.7 magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km, the US Geological Survey reported.  It was felt in Kabul and the neighbouring countries of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the Associated Press news agency reported.  Deputy governor Ghulam Sakhi Baghlani told the BBC that the casualties were in the Dara-e-Suf district of Samangan and that the toll could rise.  He added that 300 houses were damaged and hundreds of cattle killed.  Landslides sparked by the quake had blocked roads, making even more arduous what was already an eight-hour drive along winding mountain trails from the provincial capital of Aybak, the Associated Press said.  Three civil defence units had been sent to check on the damage and casualties.  Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan and particularly in the Hindu Kush region.  In 2002, a 5.3 quake in Baghlan province, which is next to Samangan, killed about 1,000 people.  And in 1998, two earthquakes measuring 5.9 and 6.6. killed more than 6,000 people along the border with Tajikistan."
360,"Ecologist Will Miles said initial research of great skua preying on Leach's petrel on St Kilda found the behaviour was unlikely to be common.  The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) has been recording ""alarming"" falls in the smaller petrels on the islands.  Mr Miles and fellow researchers used night vision gear to observe the skua.  NTS said the Leach's petrel colony on St Kilda, which it owns, is the largest in Europe and numbers about 40,000 pairs.  Researchers from Glasgow University have been investigating suggestions that great skua, or bonxie, may be eating up to 14,000 petrels every year.  The research on Hirta, St Kilda, will run until 2009.  Results of this year's work are still being analysed, however, Mr Miles revealed some intriguing insights into the bonxies' behaviour.  He said: ""The skuas are highly active on the petrel colonies at night and catch petrels in a variety of ways - both on the ground and in the air.  ""Nocturnal foraging by great skuas is thought to be quite a rare situation.  ""At least, it has not been widely reported from the most intensively studied skua colonies on Shetland or from elsewhere across the species' breeding range.  ""The situation on Kilda seems rather unique in this respect.""  Why the bonxie prey on petrels may be down to a combination of factors.  They include limited other food sources, competition between the skuas and when the birds nest close to petrel colonies.  Mr Miles said: ""Skuas are highly opportunistic predators and some individuals seem to develop a taste for certain prey types.  ""One possibility may be that on Kilda the petrels are a relatively abundant prey type, a few individual skuas have exploited this situation opportunistically and their behaviour has been copied by others looking for an easy meal.""  After assessing the safety of vantage points, the researchers spent nights close to high cliffs, steep slopes and scree boulder fields.  Mr Miles said: ""Once on-site, we then stayed put in one watching position for the hours of darkness and just observed the bird activity.""  The vigils were often to the backdrop of the sound of puffins, manx shearwaters and European storm petrels.  Mr Miles said: ""The call of the shearwaters is particularly evocative and bizarre - sometimes likened to a chicken with asthma. It is rather a wheezy, wailing sort of call.""  Mr Miles admitted it could be hard to be an impartial observer.  He said: ""Yes, Leach's petrels seem tiny and elegant seabirds when compared with bonxies, so of course it can be difficult to watch a petrel get eaten without feeling some kind of regret.  ""Predation is a normal occurrence in nature though, even if rarely observed.""  Data gathered by researchers will be used to help guide conservation efforts for both species."
361,"The Springboks have conceded numerous penalties and suffered two sin-binnings in the Tests against Wales and Ireland.  ""Sometimes I feel we're paying for the sins of our past,"" said White.  ""We're not going to make a complaint. If you make too much fuss, you don't end up with much credibility - especially if you've lost the match.""  Tri-Nations champions South Africa arrived in the British Isles harbouring hopes of becoming the first side since 1984 to achieve the Grand Slam by beating all four home nations.  But a narrow 38-36 win over Wales was followed by a 17-12 defeat against Ireland on Saturday, and White believes the Springboks have been harshly treated by the referees.  ""Against Ireland, we camped on their tryline for five minutes and they slowed ball down and stood offside,"" said White.  White also says flanker Schalk Burger - sin-binned in both of South Africa's matches - is being singled out unfairly by referees.  ""I have had time to look at the Schalk yellow card (against Ireland) and I'm starting to think that someone is putting the nail into him,"" said White.  ""He's not allowed to do things that other players are getting away with because someone has said he has a huge impact on the game.  ""His work-rate is so high that he's getting seen more often.  ""The guy is a little bit confused because when you show him the video footage and he asks what is he doing wrong, I don't know what to tell him because he's not actually doing anything wrong.""  South Africa were saddled with a reputation for over-the-top thuggery after their 53-3 defeat against England in 2002, a game marred by Jannes Labuschagne's sending-off and a succession of off-the-ball incidents.  But White says the Springboks have cleaned up their act since the World Cup."
362,"Described by nurses as ""having sex in a similar way as swinging"", the term ""daisy-chain"" comes from the gay community, says Dr Gary Wood, of the University of Birmingham.  He said it was hard to gauge how common the act was among young people as there were no statistics.  ""Sometimes these stories get pushed out of all proportion,"" he cautioned.  However, he said the prospect of engaging in something deemed unsuitable could be tempting for young people.  ""People tend to explore sex. There are lots of images in the media and in advertising about sex, but it's still repressed, it's still forbidden.  ""As something that is seen to be in need of regulation, it is seen as more dangerous to young people.""  At the Royal College of Nursing conference in London this week, Judy McRae, a sexual health nurse in London, said: ""Colleagues are coming across reports of groups of young people having sex in large groups.  ""It is known as daisy-chaining and is obviously very worrying as far as sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy is concerned.  ""As we understand it, it involves groups of older teenagers going round to each other's homes and having sex in a similar way as swinging.  ""It is very new and is only just starting to be talked about.""  Dr Wood recently took part in sexual health workshops in Birmingham with about 500 young people aged 14 to 16 - and the concept of ""daisy-chaining"" did not arise.  ""But the questions they asked left nothing to the imagination,"" he said, adding that ""nothing surprises"" him about sex.  ""For most teenagers, the first they would know of 'daisy-chaining' would be when they read it in the papers.""  The group sex nature of the activity would raise questions of sexuality for males, Dr Wood said.  ""Young men are frightened of being labelled gay. One of the strongest elements of peer pressure for boys is not being labelled as gay,"" Dr Wood said.  However, the issue of sex among teenagers did highlight the need for nurses to be trained in giving sexual health advice.  Jan Barlow, the chief executive for young persons sexual health charity Brook, said: ""It's also essential that every young person has comprehensive sex and relationships education in schools, which not only teaches them how to protect themselves but also gives them opportunities to discuss issues such as how to resist peer pressure to take part in unwanted sexual activity.""  Spokeswoman Catherine Evans said that, while she was not aware how common ""daisy-chaining"" was, young people often felt that ""everyone else"" was having sex.  ""This is usually not the case - we know that the majority of young people don't become active until late in their teens.""  She added that there was a ""tendency among young people to talk about sex more than they are actually doing it""."
363,"Historical background   Since the war started, a German battleship, the Graf Spee, had been roaming the South Atlantic sinking unarmed British merchant ships. She was being hunted by several British hunting groups, and was found by the three British cruisers, Exeter, Ajax, and Achilles on 13th December 1939, and then began the Battle of the River Plate. The main armament of the Exeter was six 8inch guns, and that of the Ajax and Achilles was eight 6inch guns. The Graf Spee had six 11inch guns and eight 6inch guns.  Personal story   On the morning of 13 Dec 1939 I was keeping the morning watch in the after control position. My particular job was to keep the lookouts awake and doing their job. It is all too easy to go to sleep sitting on a comfortable seat and leaning against a bracket holding a powerful set of Admiralty binoculars. I was a junior lieutenant in the Royal Marines and was second in command of the Royal Marine Detachment. Humphrey Woods was the Captain of Marines and at action stations he was in charge of B turret manned by the R.M. Detachment. Most cruisers had four turrets A,B,X and Y and the Marines manned X turret. However as Exeter only had three turrets A,B and Y, The Marines manned B turret. I had tried to get charge of the turret myself a few weeks earlier as it would be more interesting than chasing lookouts. But Captain Woods was not having any of it and I had to remain with my lookouts.  At about 0600 the Graf Spee was sighted well down on the horizon and the bugler sounded Action Stations over the tannoy. I well remember my heart went well down into my boots as everyone was hurrying to his position. Very soon two great clouds of fire and smoke burst from the enemy as he fired his first broadside and about a minute later a line of shells landed in the sea about 300 yards short. Our course was set to get within range of the enemy and return fire. The next enemy broadside was correct for range but fell about 300 yards astern. Thereafter we were receiving our punishment but managed to get within gun range of the Graf Spee and scored several hits.    B turret was hit by an 11 inch shell between the guns after firing about 5 broadsides and everyone in front of the breeches were killed including Capt Woods. Splinters from this shell killed several people on the bridge and cut all communications so Captain Bell (The ship's Captain) came aft to fight the ship from the after control Position. Very soon both A and Y turrets were put out of action because their electrical supplies were cut off, so Captain Bell said within my hearing "" I'm going to ram the --------. It will be the end of us but it will sink him too"". So off we set.     Fortunately the electricians managed to get Y turret working again so we turned away and carried on firing with Y turret. Normal steering of the ship was not possible due to damage so we organised a chain of seamen to pass steering orders down to the after steering position. Lookouts were no longer required so I went to look at B turret. There was some burning debris on top of one gun loading tray and immediately under it a naked charge ready for loading into the gun. Looked a nasty situation so I removed the charge by chucking it overboard and put out the fire.  I remember Marine Russel with his forearm shot away. He was walking around rallying some leaderless seamen and putting them to useful work. When we got back to Stanley in the Falkland Islands Mne Russel was taken into the hospital and appeared to be making a good recovery. However he needed a minor operation to improve his forearm stump and he died under the anaesthetic. He was buried with full military honours in Stanley on the very day the ship left for UK.     While we were getting our punishment Commodore Harwood in the Ajax and the Achilles were scoring hits on the Graf Spee from the disengaged side. It was clear that the Graf Spee was trying to get into Montevideo so Commodore Harwood signalled us to report the state of the ship and then ordered us to go back to Stanley in the Falkland Islands. Ajax and Achilles followed the Graf Spee until she was interned in Montevideo and waited outside for reinforcements in case she tried to get away. That evening we buried about 50 of the ships company at sea. On 17th December, the Graf Spee sailed out of Montevideo and scuttled herself, thus saving many lives.  I well remember our reception in Stanley. Nothing was too much for people to do for us. It took about six weeks to get the ship seaworthy. We had a lot of steel plating sent up from the whaling station in South Georgia. I had a very happy time there as I made the acquaintance of a young girl called Cora Newing. Whenever I could get ashore I would seek her out and she would provide a horse and we would go out to the lighthouse or some other beauty spot. She followed me to UK in 1943 arriving the day I was off to the Mediterranean. She joined the Marens (The Royal Marines branch of the Wrens) and had an interesting time.  My ship now was the Abercrombie a monitor with one 15 inch gun turret. I was now the Captain of Marines and manning this turret was our job. We took part in the invasions of Sicily and Italy. One day I fired off about 100 15 inch shells. Each shell weighed a ton. We would do a quick return to Malta to re ammunition between the air raids and then back to the invasion beeches. At Salerno we got mined and returned to Malta for repairs and then leaving Malta we got mined again. When the gun goes off there is a gentle but powerful ""whoosh"" in the turret. No Bang is heard. The gun recoils and then the breech worker opens the breech to load the next shell and charge. Immediately on opening the breech there is a loud roar of the air blast blowing straight up the barrel of the gun. This clears away all the smoke and gases and leaves the atmosphere good in the turret. If for any reason the air blast does not work the turret very quickly becomes uninhabitable. Inside the turret is a very comfortable place to be. The behaviour of people in the turret was just as though they were working machinery in a factory ashore. Each man just calmly doing his job, but each with his private thoughts.  After that I was transferred to the cruiser Aurora for a few months and then sent home in time for Christmas 1944. So I met Cora for the first time after a 5 year break and was married by my father one week later after getting home. My father was a priest and was Rector of Ashill near Swaffham in Norfolk. We got a special licence and he pulled a string or two so we were married a week after I met up with Cora. Cora's Commanding Officer Major Beasley Royal Marines was also very helpful to us.  In March 1945 I was with 27 Bn Royal Marines in Holland and we chased the Germans all the way up to Williamshaven.  We celebrated our diamond wedding on 30 Dec 2004.

364,"A leading exam board has said all boards raised their grade boundaries for GCSE English this summer amid claims pupils have been marked too harshly.  AQA, the board with the highest market share for English, insists this year's grades were comparable to any other.  Many teachers say pupils were marked too harshly, with many unexpectedly failing to get a benchmark C.  The Association of School and College Leaders called for an investigation.  Some head teachers have said some pupils have been awarded a whole grade lower than they were predicted.  In GCSE English, 63.9% of entries got at least a grade C, compared to 65.4% last summer. Some 15% were awarded an A or A*, down from 16.8% in 2011.  In English literature, 76.3% of exams were awarded A*-C, compared to 78.4% last year, and 23.2% got at least an A, against 25% in 2011.  In a statement, the AQA said: ""This summer, all the exam boards raised their grade boundaries for GCSE English in order to maintain standards. In AQA's case, this was by between 0 and 3 marks.""  A paper on the Ofqual website says there can be as little as 8 marks between grades at the lower end.  The AQA statement said pupils often took units for a qualification in different exam series.  ""We take account of how students have performed in each exam series when we set grade boundaries, in order to ensure that standards are maintained.  ""While grade boundaries can therefore vary between exam series, students can be confident that the grade they get for an overall qualification one year would be the same the next.""  Brian Lightman, general secretary of ASCL, has called for an investigation into English results.  He said: ""The big issue, schools are telling us, is at the C/D borderline in English.  ""What appears to have happened is that, halfway through the year, it was decided that too many students were going to get a C grade in English and the grade boundaries of the exam were pushed up very substantially.  ""Students who were working at a C level throughout the year, who were told on their assessments that they were in line for a C, have found out today that this is worth a D. This means they may not get their places at college and sixth form.  ""It is morally wrong to manipulate exam grades in this way - you are playing with young people's futures.""  And concerns over English grades have prompted particular concern in conversations on social networking sites.  Dozens of teachers have expressed their anger on the Times Educational Supplement's website.  One said: ""Have seen a very significant drop in results after 10 years of bringing in between 70 and 80%.  ""Bitterly disappointing for all concerned, but particularly for the pupils who will receive results tomorrow.""  Another wrote: ""Our results have been decimated. We're 10% lower than last year.  ""It does seem that our expected Cs became Ds and, because we're a school where most of our students are clustered around that C/D borderline, we've been hit hard.""  But Mark Dawe, chief executive of the OCR exam board, said the standard of its English qualification had been maintained.  ""Boundaries do move, unit to unit, they do move, session to session, but the overall judgment of the examiners and the quality of the students' work is key here, and those boundaries sometimes have to move to ensure that's delivered.""  Mr Dawe said examiners were ""very comfortable with the overall grades they've been awarding to those students"".  NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: ""Shifting the goal posts for grades in particular the C/D boundary has had a huge impact on individual students and the future of schools.  ""It is not only very unsettling but also extremely irresponsible. These are arbitrary changes which in no way reflect the work of students and teachers and are clearly unfair.""  The concern over English results is pertinent because this year, schools in England have to ensure that 40% of their pupils reach the government benchmark of five A*-C GCSEs, including maths and English.  This is a tougher than last year's requirement, where school were expected to ensure 35% of pupils made this grade - in total 107 schools failed.  This is one of the measures used to decide whether schools should be taken out of local authority control and pushed into academy status. The other two measures relate to pupils' progress."
365,"The Oscar nominee said he ""had an immediate emotional response"" to the project, saying it would be ""a reminder and promise"" of American democracy.  The monument has remained closed since the 11 September attacks, and needs funding for added security measures.  Scorsese's documentary will be screened in the US on 15 January.  Charlie's Angels and Mission: Impossible writer James D Buchanan will be honoured by the Writers Guild of America West.  He will receive the Morgan Cox award for his service to the guild at a Beverly Hills ceremony on 3 December.  His other TV series credits include Hawaii Five-O and Homicide.  The guild's Victoria Riskin said Mr Buchanan ""has consistently committed himself to improving the lives of writers everywhere"".  Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson has announced that he is to insure parts of his body for a total of £1m.  The Ready Steady Cook regular has valued his tongue at £500,000 and his fingers at the same price.  ""I can hobble around on wooden legs but I can't do very much in my job without my fingers,"" he said.  Worral Thompson, the new presenter of Saturday Kitchen, added that any damage to his tongue would ""destroy"" his career as both chef and TV presenter.  Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst had to have seven stitches in his face after being struck while playing a concert in New York on Friday, reports say.  The singer was performing the song Eat You Alive when he was hit on the head, MTV news said.  He managed to finish the other two songs in the band's set before being taken to hospital to be treated.  Limp Bizkit are currently on a double-headline trawl through the US with metal band Korn, called the Back to Basics tour.  Rock band Motley Crue is planning a 2004 tour with all four original members, including drummer Tommy Lee.  It will be the first time the US band has reformed since 1999, bassist Nikki Six said on the band's website.  But he added that guitarist Vince Neil ""has some resentments that need to be ironed out"" before any reunion.  Motley Crue had six UK Top 40 hits including Girls Girls Girls and Without You. Tommy Lee achieved fame as the ex-husband of actress Pamela Anderson.  Some 64 never-before-heard songs by late country singing legend Johnny Cash have been released in a box set.  The five-disc Unearthed set features songs recorded during the last decade, during Cash's partnership with rock and rap producer Rick Rubin.  The set includes a duet with the late Joe Strummer on a Bob Marley cover as well as covers of two Neil Young songs.  Cash, who died in September, also sings songs by Chuck Berry, Dolly Parton, Glen Campbell and Willie Nelson.  Sharon Osbourne is ""the most amazing woman of 2003"", according to a poll published by a website for women.  The wife and manager of rocker Ozzy Osbourne - and star of hit TV show The Osbournes - took almost a third of the votes cast in the poll by Handbag.com.  Osbourne, who was treated for cancer earlier this year, beat the likes of runner Paula Radcliffe and singer Dido in the poll.  More than 7,000 votes were cast in a range of categories."
366,"BBC Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo has carried out thousands of interviews in a broadcasting career which has also taken in Radio 1 and BBC Radio 5 live.  But the 56-year-old, who has also released a series of children's books, was on the receiving end for once when he visited Sibford School in Oxfordshire, with School Reporters Nat and Fergus asking the questions.  Q: Have you always wanted to be in radio?  A: Yes is the answer to that. I always thought I wanted to work in radio, but maybe as a studio manager - to be in charge of the sound balance and so on but I failed the hearing test, so I had to re-think the whole thing. I went into local radio and then started presenting and realised that that's what I wanted to do.  Q: What's the most difficult challenges you are presented with when doing live radio?  A: The most difficult time is probably when you are interviewing someone who doesn't want to be interviewed. Actors sign on and they have to do promotion, but a lot of them don't want to do promotion, so they come over very badly and I want to throttle them!  Q: You have a confessions feature, which is very popular. Do you have any confessions to share?  A: This is a mild confession really: on my birthday my producer had arranged for the supermodel Naomi Campbell to come in with a birthday cake.  When she came in I wasn't sure who she was. I was live on the radio and my producer (the idiot), never said 'it's Naomi Campbell' until about five minutes later. That was sort of embarrassing, and I had to apologise to her afterwards. I don't think that would get on air on the show!  Q: Have you been surprised by the success of your books?  A: I set out to write it for my son, and it was only because he liked it that I thought maybe other people would like it. If you told me there was going to be three books, I would have been very surprised.  Q: When you were writing the books, did you ever struggle with writer's block?  A: Not writer's block as much as it is conventionally understood which is people saying 'I can't write anything'. There are many days were two paragraphs is all you're going to get. So it wasn't writer's block in that I couldn't think of anything to write, but sometimes it is a lot slower then what it should be.  Q: Do you have a favourite time to write?  A: Because my radio show is in the afternoon, I always try to do writing in the morning. I used to try to work in the morning and write a thousand words a day but that doesn't really work anymore. So now, I write any time, all the time, wherever I can find a space.  Q: Now you have become a successful author, what advice would you give to people aspiring to be authors?  A: The conventional advice is probably the best advice. That is to read as much as you possibly can. Read stuff you know you like, you think you might like and just expand the sort of stuff you are reading.  I think of it as input and output; the more stuff that comes in, the more you have got going around in your head and the more creative your story will become.  Q: The music industry has changed a lot in the last 10 years, with music streaming. Is it a good thing for the music industry and musicians?  A: It doesn't really matter if it is a good thing, it is a thing and it is happening and the whole of music and the whole of radio has to adapt and move on and change. I think radio almost has to become like a live streaming service anyway.  Whether it is good or bad, some people will benefit and some people won't, but it is the future so they have to adapt really or get left behind."
367,"The artwork has now been removed by Tube advertising bosses A Banksy poster that was censored for use on the Tube has been restored by an unidentified graffiti artist. Transport for London (TfL) banned the halo dripping with paint on Banksy's artwork promoting his film Exit Through The Gift Shop. The poster was reworked and displayed without the offending drips. But within days of it going up at London Bridge Tube on 11 March, the golden circle over the kneeling boy's head was repainted. The artwork has now been removed by Tube advertising bosses who said it was ""defaced"". Benjamin Moore from Art Below, the team behind the poster, part of a programme of art on the Underground, said he did not know who had amended the work but there was a chance it was the artist himself. ""It is either Banksy or one of his people. Or it could be a massive fan who wants the artwork to remain how it originally was,"" he said. ""In the past he wrote to us and told us there are too many rules and regulations on the Tube."" The work was originally designed as a free poster to go with a promotional pack of flyers produced for students regularly by organisation Don't Panic. The poster was free but, now many people are selling it on eBay,"" said Mr Moore. Mr Moore said that when the group first started working with artists around five years ago they had approached Banksy but he had turned them down. A Transport for London spokesperson said: ""The artwork in question was accepted for display on one site on the Tube network by CBS Outdoor, our advertising contractor, and was without the halo. ""However the artwork has been removed because it was subsequently defaced.""     "
368,"In politics, it has often been noted, there is a marked aversion to the words ""yes"" and ""no"".  Politicians didn't get where they are today by blurting out answers to questions that later cause them to be backed rat-like into a corner.  But they often have the need for strategic reasons to make it seem like they are not going to do something, or that a particular allegation is untrue, without actually going as far as saying so.  Here they often make use of a technique that allows them to rubbish something while using a form of words that, on closer examination, is sufficiently ambiguous to support a number of interpretations.  David Miliband told the BBC ""I'm not wavering... I am not a candidate.""  But what he did not say was: ""I point blank will not be standing for the Labour leadership, whatever the circumstances.""  Instead he used what, in the US, is called a non-denial denial - a term commonly attributed to the Watergate-era Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee.  A classic example was Tony Blair's statement that ""Labour has no plans to introduce tuition fees for higher education"" as a response to a question on whether Labour planned fees.  The answer was accurate. The plans were not drawn up until after the election.  Perhaps the most famous non-denial denial was that issued by Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. The saxophone-playing leader of the free world said: ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.""  And under a detailed legal definition of sexual relations, if not in the spirit of the allegations against him, he had not.  Later, clarifying another of his statements, Clinton said: ""It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If 'is' means 'is and never has been' that's one thing - if it means 'there is none', that was a completely true statement.""  Another example came from the spokesman of erstwhile England footballer David Beckham.  After newspapers alleged he had had an affair with assistant Rebecca Loos, Beckham released a statement saying: ""During the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life.""  At least three broadsheets ran headlines suggesting Beckham had denied the affair in the statement.  After politics, sport is the natural habitat of the non-denial denial.  Managers are always playing down links to particular players by using clouds of ambiguity like ""we have had no contact with him"" or ""these newspapers are full of rubbish"".  But in the world of politics there are always some who are prepared to make a categoric denial.  ""I will never stand again for the leadership of the Conservative Party,"" Michael Howard told the BBC News website in November 2002. One year later he became leader of the Conservative Party, although he was of course chosen unopposed.  Labour leader Neil Kinnock said of Miliband this week, he was ""absolutely, definitely, beyond peradventure, 22-carat certain that David never was going to run and certainly isn't going to run"".  In the US this would be known as a Sherman pledge - a cast-iron denial.  William Tecumseh Sherman famously said of the possibility of being the Republican nominee for president: ""If nominated, I will not accept... If elected, I will not serve.""  A similar form of words has since been used by Lyndon Johnson, and more recently by Dick Cheney, but perhaps most pithily by former presidential candidate Mo Udall who said: ""If nominated, I shall run to Mexico. If elected, I shall fight extradition.""  But politicians mostly like to leave themselves some ""wriggle room"".  Al Gore recently said: ""I'm not planning to be a candidate again, ever. I have no intention of being a candidate.""  But he added: ""I haven't made a Shermanesque statement because it just seems odd to do so.""  Political pundit Prof Tony King says: ""They don't deny things because they almost always want to leave open the opportunity to change their minds... That strikes me as very sensible. I don't believe it has ever seriously backfired.""  And as long as it remains a sin to change your mind, the non-denial denial will live on.  The sad thing is, people are using these 'non-denials' in everyday life now. We are so used to seeing them in the papers and coming from the mouths of various politicians and others that we know to look through them to the vague shred of truth that may or may not be there. One day there will be a genuinely honest politician and the nation will go into shock.  Heather, Wolverhampton  ""If asked, do not answer. If quoted, do not admit."" Alternatively, always answer the question you wish you had been asked. Everyone has some special gift, and this is the one talent we can rely on our politicians to exercise. A lie by any other name...  G. Connolly, West Chester, PA, USA"
369,"A nine-year-old girl has officially opened the 2012 Olympic Stadium, at a ceremony in east London.  Niamh Clarke-Willis joined Locog head Lord Coe to hit a button which launched balloons into the sky above the venue for this summer's Games.  Around 40,000 members of the public were at the stadium in Stratford to witness the opening, which included a laser light show.  The ""2,012 hours to go"" event tested the park's management and security.  Lord Coe said: ""It's a fantastic feeling. The seven years have just flown by. Tonight is only the start of the story.  Inside the vast and impressive stadium, it's hard to know where to look. Most eyes around me turned right to watch the latest high jump record attempt, as a long jumper took aim in the distance and a pole vaulter limbered up to our left. Meanwhile the 4 X 400m relay racers lined up on the track. Fresh from their Christmas number one, The Military Wives sang the national anthem, though sadly out of tune. The crowd was meant to join in, using our vuvuzela-esque Visa-sponsored singalong song cards, but no-one prompted us. When the moment came, once the very British brass band had finished, the stadium lights suddenly switched off and the audience shrieked. Coldplay's Paradise offered the perfect soundtrack to a very special moment as the stadium was officially opened ahead of the many wonders in store.  ""We want thousands of young people to be inspired to take up sport. We hope that for a few of them it will be the start of their journey.  ""I'm grateful to everyone who came here tonight to celebrate this moment in history.""  Spectators had to queue to enter the venue after airport-style security checks.  Simon Levy, who came to the Olympic Park for the first time on Saturday, said: ""It's not a problem, really. It's much quicker than the airport and it's good to be checked because now we know we're safe.""  Police helicopters flew over the park and armed police patrolled the area.  Adrian Casy, a security guard at the Olympic Stadium, said Saturday's events were among the main rehearsals for the Games, particularly in moving and managing the crowds of spectators from the park and from one venue to another.  ""Honestly, so far, so good, although we're still trying hard to make it run smoother,"" said Mr Casy, adding that some spectators were wearing ""insufficient clothing"" to cope with the weather conditions.  TV presenters Vernon Kay and Gabby Logan hosted the event which saw entertainment from impressionist Jon Culshaw, actor Hugh Bonneville, singer and former Spice Girl Melanie C, rapper Chipmunk and comedian Jack Whitehall.  Some 140,000 people are expected at the Olympic site over six days.  The celebrations are part of the British Universities and Colleges Sport Outdoor Athletics Championships and the Visa London Disability Grand Prix which are test events for the venue.  London 2012 hopefuls Perri Shakes-Drayton and Holly Bleasdale are competing at the BUCS event which runs from 4-7 May.  Later in the week, the Olympic Stadium will also play host to the Sainsbury's 2012 School Games , for 1,600 school-aged elite athletes."
370,"In a broad attack on airlines' efforts to tackle carbon emissions, Ian Pearson said Ryanair was the ""irresponsible face of capitalism"".  But Mr O'Leary said Mr Pearson was ""silly"" and ""hadn't a clue what he is talking about"".  Mr Pearson also said the attitude of US airlines to emissions was ""a disgrace"".  In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Pearson said: ""When it comes to climate change, Ryanair are not just the unacceptable face of capitalism, they are the irresponsible face of capitalism.""  He also attacked British Airways, saying it was ""only just playing ball"" on environmental regulations, and Lufthansa, the German airline.  Mr O'Leary defended his company and the industry as a whole.  ''We are the greenest airline in Europe but you know being savaged by a dead sheep - as we were by this minister this morning - is like water off a duck's back.''  ""What he should be attacking is the power generation stations and the road transport who between them account for over 50% of emissions.""  He said the ""silly"" minister and ""eco-lunatics"" were targeting the aviation industry when it accounted for 2% of the problem.  Even though his company was growing, the new planes it had invested £10bn in the last five years had cut its emissions and fuel consumption by 50%, Mr O'Leary said.  He added: ""He hasn't a clue what he's talking about and is attacking the wrong target in the airlines.""  But Green Party MEP Caroline Lucas said Mr Pearson should resign or scrap the government's aviation expansion plans.  ""Ian Pearson's comments are absolutely incredible,"" she said.  ""If anyone other than a government minister had made them they would have been a useful contribution to our efforts to tackle climate change.  ""But for someone with collective responsibility for the government's support of the biggest expansion of the aviation industry in a generation to do so is nothing less than a deceptive admission of failure.""  Chancellor Gordon Brown attempted to boost the government's green credentials in his pre-Budget report by doubling air passenger duty from £5 to £10 on short haul flights. Passengers on long haul flights could pay up to £80 extra.  But green campaigners said the increased levy would make little difference to emissions.  Friends of the Earth said if the government was serious about fighting climate change it should scrap airport expansion plans and tax breaks for the air industry.  Ryanair has opposed efforts by the EU to control aviation carbon emissions by including them in a trading scheme, saying it would discriminate against low-cost airlines.  The EU's scheme will see airlines pay for exceeding their current level of emissions.  Flights within Europe will come under the jurisdiction of the Emissions Trading Scheme by 2011.  The scheme would be expanded from 2012 to include all international flights that arrive at or depart from an EU airport.  Airlines would be issued with pollution permits - those that cut emissions would be able to sell their surplus while an airline that increased its emissions would have to buy more permits.  The US has already questioned whether it would be legal within global trading rules to force airlines flying into the EU to take part in the scheme.  And there are reports that US airlines are considering legal action to overturn the EU's efforts.  In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""Urgent progress is needed to ensure that aviation addresses its climate change impacts.""  Toby Nicol, spokesman for Budget airline Easyjet, said the company ""stands full-square with the government"" on the proposal to include EU internal flights and international flights in the carbon trading scheme.  Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Chris Huhne said Mr Pearson's focus should be directed at the chancellor to encourage him to make ""the right framework to ensure that airlines are sustainable in the long run so the planet is there for our children and our grandchildren rather than whinging about the airlines."""
371,"At least five people have been killed in clashes in Western Sahara, after Moroccan security forces broke up a protest camp in the disputed region.  The camp, for several thousand people near the territory's capital, Laayoune, was the biggest protest against Moroccan rule in the 35-year dispute.  Dozens of people were also injured in the violence, which later spread to the streets of Laayoune.  It came shortly before talks began in the US on the future of the territory.  The Gadaym Izik camp was set up about a month ago outside Laayoune as a protest by displaced Sahrawi people about their living conditions. It was home to more than 12,000 people.  Witnesses said security forces entered the camp in the early hours of the morning, using helicopters and water cannon to force people to leave.  ""Hundreds of women and children were seen outside the camp leading towards Laayoune but a certain number of Sahrawi [local] men refused to go,"" one witness told the AFP news agency.  Moroccan officials said five security personnel had been killed in the unrest.  The pro-independence Polisario Front said Moroccan security forces had killed a 26-year-old protester at the camp, a claim denied by Morocco.  Television images showed protesters in Laayoune throwing stones at police and setting fire to tyres and vehicles. Several buildings, including a TV station, were also on fire.  One protester said: ""Anger is boiling over. We are in the streets protesting against Morocco.""  An official told Reuters the security forces had been forced to intervene after the demonstration turned violent. He said several people had been arrested.  Polisario heavily criticised the operation to close the camp.  The movement's self-appointed government is based in Algeria, from where its foreign minister, Salem Ould Salek, accused Morocco of acting ""in a ferocious and undiscriminating fashion"" against ""defenceless civilians"".  The unrest set a tense tone for the opening of UN-mediated talks in New York between negotiators from the Moroccan government and members of Polisario.  ""It is highly unfortunate that this operation and the events preceding and following it have affected the atmosphere in which these talks are being held,"" said UN spokesman Martin Nesirky.  ""We call on all parties involved to exercise the utmost restraint in the hours and days to come.""  Ahmed Boujari, representing Polisario in New York, said the raid was ""a deliberate act to wreck the talks"".  ""I hope that the UN Security Council will take up this affair,"" AFP quoted him as saying.  Moroccan officials have said they acted within the law.  Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, is the scene of Africa's longest-running territorial dispute.  The phosphate-rich territory was annexed by Morocco after Spanish settlers left in 1975. Polisario fought a guerrilla war against Morocco until the UN brokered a ceasefire in 1991.  Rabat now offers to grant it autonomy, while Polisario is demanding a referendum on full independence.  The talks between both sites have been deadlocked for years, and the last meeting in February 2010 ended without any movement in the dispute."
372,"Children's programmes will no longer be shown on BBC One and Two following the digital switchover, the BBC Trust has confirmed.  Award-winning shows such as Horrible Histories and Blue Peter will move permanently to CBBC and CBeebies.  No date has been set for the change, but the final analogue transmitters will be switched off in Northern Ireland between 10-24 October.  The confirmation came in a report approving the BBC's cost-cutting plans.  Spending on children's programmes will not be affected, and the move is unlikely to be detrimental to viewing figures.  In recent months, the number of young people watching children's programmes on the BBC's main terrestrial channels has occasionally dropped as low as 1,000.  Figures on digital have steadily increased since its introduction of CBBC and CBeebies in 2002.  Blue Peter, for example, is now seen by an average audience of 123,000 6-12 year olds when it is shown on CBBC.  BBC One repeats of the show are watched by an average of 30,000 children in the same age range.  A Trust spokesperson said: ""Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere.  ""Only a very small percentage of children still solely watch these programmes on BBC One and BBC Two alone, so moving them to digital channels is merely following current viewing patterns and reflects the fact that CBeebies and CBBC will be universally available on digital TV from the end of this year.""  The BBC Trust document was its final report into cost-saving plans known internally as ""Delivering Quality First"".  It confirmed that cuts to local radio and TV services would be halved - with savings now in the region of £8m, compared to the original proposal of £15m.  As a result, reductions in local news teams will be lower, and coverage of local sport will be ""more protected"", the Trust said.  A plan for local radio stations to share programmes in the afternoon will now be limited to a ""very small number"" of stations.  However, on weekday evenings between 19:00 and 22:00, all of the BBC's regional stations in England will join together for a new all-England programme, although stations will have the flexibility to opt for local sports coverage.  Across the BBC, some of the main points noted by the BBC Trust were:  The BBC Trust, which is the governing body of the BBC, drew up its report in consultation with listeners, viewers and other broadcasters.  BBC management responded to the report, saying: ""We welcome the BBC Trust's full approval of our Delivering Quality First proposals.  ""The coming years will involve a significant effort from people at every level of the BBC to deliver the savings while we continue to provide the quality programmes and services that audiences expect from us."""
373,"The Sri Lankan Government has announced that it will enter a month-long truce with the Tamil Tigers in response to a ceasefire announced by the rebels.  Earlier this week the Tamil Tigers said they would begin a month-long ceasefire on 24 December and order their forces to halt all attacks.  Sri Lanka's new prime minister, Ranil Wickramasinghe, has pledged to hold peace talks to end the country's long-running ethnic conflict.  The Tamil Tigers announced a similar ceasefire late last year but it eventually collapsed amid renewed fighting between the rebels and government forces.  The ceasefire announcement came even as Australia listed the Tamil Tigers as a terrorist organisation and froze their assets.  The government also announced that it was lifting an economic embargo imposed on rebel-held territory.  ""As part of its initiative to bring about an atmosphere conducive to invigorating the peace process, the government will take immediate steps to improve living conditions for civilians in the uncleared (rebel-held) areas,"" the statement said. The Tamil Tigers had called for the embargo to be lifted while announcing their truce earlier this week. Efforts brokered by Norway to get the majority Sinhalese government and minority Tamil rebels to the negotiating table have so far failed to make headway. But Mr Wickremasinghe's United National Party (UNP) went into its first parliamentary session on Wednesday with firm promises of renewed peace talks. His new administration may be more inclined to take the LTTE gesture seriously. He is due to visit India on Saturday, and a BBC correspondent in Colombo says he may well seek advice on how to restart the peace process. The rebels said they declared the ceasefire, ""encouraged by the collective mandate for peace and ethnic harmony given by the Sinhala and Tamil masses at the general election"". The Tigers are fighting for an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east of the country."
374,"She accuses him of taking six lovers, including his secretary Gaynor Regan - the woman he married after his divorce.  She also claims her 52-year-old ex-husband had a habit of drinking heavily, in one incident in 1987 passing out on the floor of a hotel with a brandy bottle.  Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Howard blasted the foreign secretary's handling of the civil war in Sierra Leone, said he had ""bungled"" the royal visit to India last year and had ""dithered"" over the conflict in Kosovo.  ""We don't need Mrs Cook's book to draw attention to the record of Robin Cook as Foreign Secretary and it is a disastrous record,"" he said.  ""It is simply not believable that he could have had a drink problem, especially in 1987, when he was running the Tories ragged and making his reputation as the best parliamentary performer of his generation.  ""No one who knows Robin and who knows how hard he works is going to believe this.""  A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Cook had declined to comment about the book.  A Downing Street spokesman also refused to comment on Mrs Cook's book, saying: ""We are not in the business of helping to sell books.""  In her book A Slight and Delicate Creature, Mrs Cook portrayed the foreign secretary as cold and unfeeling, saying he abandoned her at London's Heathrow airport on the eve of a holiday when told his affair with Ms Regan had been discovered by the press.  Mrs Cook could provoke further tensions within the Cabinet by alleging that Mr Cook is increasingly jealous of Chancellor Gordon Brown and ""hates"" former Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson.  But in an interview with the Sunday Times, Mrs Cook, 54, denied she was trying to wound her former husband.  ""I am really not motivated by revenge of any description,"" she said.  ""If I had wanted to bring down the world around Robin's ears I would have written it very differently.""  Mrs Cook said her 28-year marriage gradually soured as she realised her husband was taking a string of lovers.  Their sex life suffered during his affairs - and recovered when they ended, she said.  She recounted in detail the day in August 1997 when Mr Cook told her their marriage was over at Heathrow, after Mr Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell telephoned to tell Mr Cook a newspaper had discovered his latest affair.  The couple divorced soon afterwards. Mr Cook married Ms Regan in 1998.  Mrs Cook, a hospital consultant, still lives in the Edinburgh house she shared with the foreign secretary."
375,"Palestinian witnesses and medical staff said Yasser Abu al-Aesh was shot dead in a battle with Israeli soldiers in Rafah along with three other militants.  Israeli army sources said the men opened fire and threw a grenade as soldiers approached the men's house.  Al-Aesh, who had lost three limbs in a bomb-making accident, was reportedly high on Israel's wanted list.  The house where the men had been staying in the Rafah refugee camp was completely destroyed.  At one point in the fight al-Aesh and his brother ran out of ammunition, Palestinian witnesses told the Associated Press news agency.  There are conflicting reports as to how al-Aesh lost his legs and arm last year.  Some reports say a rocket he was building exploded prematurely; others say an Israeli tank shell hit his rocket firing team, maiming him and killing his comrades.  The troops, who had been supported by helicopters, later withdrew from the area.  On Sunday Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz said a warning from the spiritual leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas that its members would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers meant Israel had to strike at militant leaders.  ""[Sheikh Ahmed] Yassin's statement makes it more imperative for Israel to attack the heads of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad,"" Mr Mofaz said.  More than 2,600 Palestinians and at least 875 Israelis have died since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000."
376,"The Dublin-based C&C Group has bought Tennent's lager in a deal worth £180m.  C&C, which makes Magners cider, has acquired the Irish, Northern Irish and Scottish businesses of Anheuser-Busch InBev, including the Tennent's brands.  The cost of the merger between Anheuser-Busch and InBev is thought to have forced the company to sell some of its assets.  Tennent's is Scotland's leading lager, accounting for 55% of pub sales. C&C said the deal made good business sense.  Stephen Glancey, C&C's chief operating officer, said: ""We're buying it because it's a fantastic iconic Scottish brand and above everything else it will provide us with a platform for developing Magners in Scotland.""  The firm makes the cider brands Bulmers and Magners, as well as a range of niche spirits and liqueurs.  Along with Tennent's lager, it has also acquired the Wellpark Brewery in Glasgow and distribution rights for brands including Becks and Stella Artois.  A spokesman for the company said that he expected that Tennent's sponsorship of the annual rock festival T in the Park would continue."
377,"A Sri Lanka hen has given birth to a chick without an egg, in a new twist on the age-old question of whether the chicken or the egg came first.  Instead of passing out of the hen's body and being incubated outside, the egg was incubated in the hen for 21 days and then hatched inside the hen.  The chick is fully formed and healthy, although the mother has died.  The government veterinary officer in the area said he had never seen anything like it before.  PR Yapa, the chief veterinary officer of Welimada, where it took place, examined the hen's carcass.  He found that the fertilised egg had developed within the hen's reproductive system, but stayed inside the hen's body until it hatched.  A post-mortem conducted on the hen's body concluded that it died of internal wounds.  The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says that the story has made headlines in Sri Lanka, with the Sri Lankan Daily Mirror's concluding: ""The chicken came first; not the egg."""
378,"The 25-year-old suffered a fractured left fibula and an open dislocation of his left ankle after a tackle by Birmingham's Martin Taylor.  Eduardo will have his leg in plaster for the next six to eight weeks before beginning a rehabilitation programme.  Arsenal say the Croatia international should be running again in six months.  Eduardo is expected to be out of the game for nine months but, in a statement, Arsenal said: ""Eduardo would like to once again thank everyone for the overwhelming messages of support he has received.""  After sustaining the injury, Eduardo was taken to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham and underwent surgery on Saturday before being transferred to a London-based hospital on Sunday.  Taylor has been targeted by some angry fans - including a number from Croatia - who have posted threatening messages on various internet sites.  And security personnel had to restrain Croatian journalists, who ran on to the road and tried to get into Taylor's car as he left the club's Wast Hills training complex on Monday.  But Croatia manager Slaven Bilic, who will now be without his prolific striker for the European Championship finals this summer, has been quick to defend the 28-year-old centre-half.  ""The injury made the tackle look bad,"" Bilic told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""You see many tackles like that, almost every week.""  ""That's perhaps wrong for football but I'm sure Martin Taylor is a sportsman and he wanted to play the ball.  ""On another occasion Eduardo could have received a worse tackle and got away without injury - everything went wrong but Eduardo knows Taylor didn't do it deliberately.""  The incident occurred early on in Arsenal's 2-2 draw at St Andrew's and Birmingham manager Alex McLeish conceded the experience has been difficult for Taylor psychologically.  But McLeish does not believe Taylor's straight red card was warranted.  ""The fact that (some commentators were surprised at the red card) tells the story itself - it was seen as just another normal tackle in a game of football where there is contact,"" he stated.  ""Martin was horrified. There certainly wasn't a big protest over the red card from him but he has seen the damage that was done to Eduardo and I could see it in his face.  ""Even if the referee had given him a yellow card I don't know if he could have played on any way.""  ""We've had to rally round Martin Taylor because he is mentally shattered by the whole experience.""  Former Rangers and Scotland boss McLeish recalled the way ex-Celtic striker Henrik Larsson came back from a horrific leg break in 1999 and is hopeful for Eduardo.  ""Henrik Larsson received a bad one a few years ago in Lyon, while playing for Celtic and when I saw Eduardo I could think it was something similar,"" added McLeish.  ""The technology and medical treatments nowadays meant Henrik Larsson came back to show he was a world-class player.  ""Eduardo's a world-class player and he's definitely in the right hands and I'm sure he will come back.""  Meanwhile, former Coventry defender David Busst is confident Eduardo, who has scored 12 goals in his debut season for Arsenal, will play again if there are no complications in his recovery.  Busst's career was ended by a similar injury to Eduardo's and was suffered against Manchester United in 1996.  ""If there's no complications, I'm sure he will be back playing again,"" Busst told BBC Radio 5 Live.  ""It wasn't the break that stopped me playing again but the infections I caught after that.  ""I suffered a double compound fracture of the tibia and fibula and had 20 operations on my right leg, with 10 operations in the first 12 days.  ""I'd like to reassure Eduardo and tell him not to let people compare his injury to mine because I did have to give up.  ""It was the infection, muscle and tissue damage that stopped me from playing again.  ""They will have closed up where the bone had come out from the skin and pinned the bones.  ""If they have done all that without any infection then he will be back playing when the bone has healed in about 12 months."""
379,"A new weekly midweek ""official chart update"" is set to launch on BBC Radio 1.  The half-hour show beginning on 10 March will air every Wednesday between 3.30-4pm in the run-up to the traditional Sunday chart countdown.  Up until now official midweek chart numbers have been issued to workers in the industry but not broadcast in this format.  Martin Talbot, managing director of the Official Charts Company, said: ""The launch of this official chart update will mean that, for the first time, music fans will get a reliable insight into how the race for number one is shaping up.""  The update will be based on the ""sales flashes"" which are already circulated by the Official Charts Company to the music industry on Wednesday mornings.  98% of singles are now downloaded. There have been close chart races in recent weeks between the likes of Rage Against The Machine and Joe McElderry for the Christmas number one.  Greg James will be hosting the new weekly show. He said: ""I want to shine a light on all the songs going in and dropping out of the charts.  ""Why are people buying a specific record? Why aren't they buying that one? Reasons like that.""  Artists have been having their say on the news.  Rapper Tinie Tempah, promoting his single Pass Out, has mixed feelings.  ""I always used to look forward to the Sunday chart and then I found that when I got into the music industry we had the opportunity to see midweeks - at first I didn't really like it,"" he said.  ""So for me personally it was ruining the suspense of watching for a whole week.  ""I guess there are two sides to it, when people go and buy music, as well as liking the song, they're also supporting the artists and buying into the artist.  Dizzee Rascal, who enjoyed three number one singles in 2009, said: ""It might be good for people to know who's there and make people more excited I guess. It might kill the anticipation a bit or it might add to it - we'll see.""  London electro-poppers Hot Chip, who release their fourth album One Life Stand today (1 February), added: ""It's not something I get too involved with really, the chart positions.  ""I definitely used to like it as a kid, I used to listen to the radio every Sunday and listen to the countdown and watch Top Of The Pops on a Thursday.  ""It'd be nice to have that excitement back again. Maybe something like this could help with that.  ""I guess what music fans have demanded is free music.""  The official charts company will also publish the official midweek chart updates on single and album sales on Radio 1's website, Facebook and Twitter.  Read now - Glastonbury line-up 'nearly done'"
380,"The EU says it will end its mission to reform Guinea-Bissau's security forces next month because law and order has deteriorated in the West African state.  The existing mission, launched in June 2008, will end on 30 September, an EU statement said on Monday.  ""Political instability and the lack of respect for the rule of law... makes it impossible for the EU to deploy a follow-up mission,"" the EU said.  Army mutineers overthrew the prime minister and military chief in April.  Mutiny leader Gen Antonio Indjai was later appointed head of the armed forces.  The statement from the European Council, representing EU governments, said the EU had ""repeatedly expressed its concern regarding the violation of constitutional order, illegal detention of civilian and military leaders and impunity of perpetrators"".  Gen Indjai's appointment ""constitutes another setback to the process of democratic consolidation and confirms that the conditions for deployment of the new [EU] mission are not met"", the statement said.  The EU has been helping Guinea-Bissau put basic legislation in place to enable it to reform its defence, police and judiciary.  Guinea-Bissau is a major transit point for cocaine smuggled from Latin America to Europe.  After the April revolt, the US accused two senior military men from Guinea-Bissau of drug running.  Air force head Ibraima Papa Camara and former navy chief Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto were named ""drug kingpins"" - a designation triggering financial sanctions on them and a ban on US citizens doing business with them."

382,"The house in Ewloe, Flintshire, is on sale for £595,000.  The 24-year-old player lived at the house for about four years and bought a whole row of houses down the road for his parents and other members of his family.  Owen, who has a baby daughter with his partner Louise, no longer needs the home where he stored his England football caps because he has moved into his £1.6m country manor house at Soughton Hall in Sychdyn, near Mold.  The property for sale has five bedrooms, two studies, a double garage, three bath or shower rooms and a top floor billiards and games room.  Owen, whose girlfriend is recovering in hospital after breaking her pelvis in a horse accident at their Soughton Hall home, was previously embroiled in a row with ramblers over the Ewloe house.  Ramblers claimed that a public footpath ran through his front room and they had the right of way.  However, the path has now been diverted and the property has four CCTV cameras, a gate entry system and burglar alarm, and the rear gardens are set behind a brick wall for privacy reasons.  One neighbour who did not wish to be identified said a number of people had been to see it.  ""Most seemed interested in buying a beautiful house rather than who lived there before.""  Coincidentally, his childhood home in Cromwell Close, Hawarden was put on the market in April last year.  That was advertised for £190,000 and the sale is said to be proceeding with the house ""under offer""."

But captain Gareth Ainsworth and midfielder Matt Bloomfield are among those offered new deals.  Young midfield pairing Jesse-Kewley Graham and Josh Scowen have also been made new offers.  Highly-rated defender Anthony Stewart is still considering the offer of a new two-year contract, while left-back Charles Dunne has been offered a one-year contract extension which would keep him at the club until 2014.

384,"Cambodia should have sovereignty over most of the disputed land around the Preah Vihear temple on the border with Thailand, the UN's top court has ruled.  The International Court of Justice in the Hague said Thailand must withdraw troops from around the hilltop temple.  But it did not give Cambodia all the disputed land, saying it had no jurisdiction to rule on a hill nearby.  Both governments welcomed the ruling, with the Thai prime minister calling on her people to accept the verdict.  In a televised address, Yingluck Shinawatra told Thais that both countries would work together to achieve peace.  Her Cambodian counterpart, Hun Sen, also addressed his nation, repeating a promise to work with Thailand to keep the border peaceful and ""not do anything that will lead to tension"".  ""This is a significant step forward... towards a peaceful resolution,"" he said.  The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Bangkok says the ruling was a qualified victory for Cambodia, and the two sides will now have to negotiate.  The 900-year-old Hindu temple is perched on a cliff in Cambodia, but more easily accessed from the Thai side.  The long-standing rift has previously led to clashes between the two nations, which both lay claim to the land.  A 1962 verdict by the court declared the temple to be Cambodian, but did not rule on the area around it.  Cambodia sought a clarification of the ruling two years ago, after fighting erupted.  Delivering the judgement, Peter Tomka, president of the International Court of Justice, said the court had decided ""that Cambodia had sovereignty over the whole territory of the promontory of Preah Vihear"".  ""In consequence, Thailand was under an obligation to withdraw from that territory the Thai military or police forces or other guards or keepers that were stationed there,"" he said.  Both sides agreed to withdraw troops from the disputed area in December 2011.  On Saturday, the chief of Cambodia's military forces on the Thailand border called an emergency meeting after Thai aircraft were seen flying low around disputed land near the temple.  However, Cambodian regional commander General Srey Deuk told the BBC he expected no problems with the Thai military after Monday's verdict.  He said no troop reinforcements had been brought up to the temple.  But fears remain about possible violence in border villages, stirred up by nationalist groups.  One Thai nationalist group, the Thai Patriotic Network, has said it will reject any judgement from the ICJ, according to The Nation newspaper. The group has already petitioned the court to throw out the case.  The territory has been a point of contention for over a century.  The decision to award the temple to Cambodia in 1962 rankled Thailand, but the issue lay largely moribund due to Cambodia's civil war, which only ended in the 1990s.  It came to the forefront again when Cambodia applied for Unesco World Heritage status in 2008, which it won - angering Thai nationalists. Both sides began a build-up of troops in the area.  The ICJ ruling is an interpretation of the 1962 judgement and cannot be appealed."
385,"Nothe Fort in Weymouth is a monument to a time when military sea defence was an important part of life not only for Weymouth and Portland, but was considered a priority for the whole country.  Fearing an attack from the French, Prime Minister Palmerston endorsed an 1860 report that recommended building a series of sea defences in strategic positions around the UK coast.  But by the time Nothe Fort was completed in 1872, the threat from the French had long passed and the fort's firepower had been superceded – resulting in Nothe Fort, and the other forts that had been built as part of the plans, becoming known as Palmerston's Follies – said to be the most expensive programme of fixed defence ever built in peacetime.  During World War II, the fort had an anti-aircraft gun stationed inside it, but its main role was storing anti-aircraft ammunition for the south west.  The fort remained in service until 1956, and Weymouth and Portland Borough Council took over responsibility in 1961.  Abandoned, the building fell into disrepair at the hands of trespassers and squatters, but its prime location and spectacular views of Weymouth seafront and Portland ensured it was never totally forgotten.  But since the building's takeover by the Weymouth Civic Society, the fort, since 1980, has slowly been restored to its former glory, plus a military museum, and is one of Weymouth's most popular tourist attractions with up to 45,000 visitors a year.  David Joy, Director of Nothe Fort, says: ""It's a very important building and it's a part of our heritage. It was built to defend this part of the coast and it's a monument to the endeavours of the Victorian engineers.  ""It shows their brilliance in construction - thousands of tonnes of rock were brought in and a lot of it was put in place by hand - it's a testament to their ingenuity.""  And as well as a reminder of Dorset's contribution to military history, the fort is also developing a new community-based role, staging plays by local theatre groups in the central courtyard.  The fort is run by a team of five paid staff members and a dedicated team of 70 volunteers.  Says Brian: ""Lots of work has been done on the fort and there's great comradeship between all of the volunteers.""  Anyone interested in volunteering at the fort can contact Director David Joy.  David says: ""We're always on the look out for volunteers. We couldn't run the fort without them. There's always a role for someone to play here, whatever your skills may be."""
386,"Widows in Nepal lose their status within the home and society Widows in Nepal are protesting against a decision by the Nepalese government to offer a cash incentive to men for marrying them. The incentive was announced in the government's annual budget earlier this week - it is a lump sum of 50,000 Nepali rupees ($641). Nepal has a large number of widows because of the bloody conflict there in recent years as well as the high rates of HIV and other diseases found in the country. But human rights groups in Nepal say that paying men to marry widows would only bring further misery. ""It's totally wrong,"" says Lily Thapa, founder of Women for Human Rights. ""Widows will not be empowered by getting remarried,"" she says. Women for Human Rights represents Nepali widows and has officially lodged a protest with the government asking it to rethink its policy. Ms Thapa says she is encouraged by the government's recognition of the plight of widows but emphasises that this policy could do more harm than good. Anybody walking on the road could say, look, there's a widow! I could get 50,000 rupees if I married her    She is urging the government to provide social security payments, health care and education to the women, who have a low status in traditional Nepalese society. Widows like 29-year-old Nisha Swar, whose husband was killed by Maoist fighters six years ago, say the policy of offering payment for remarriage could lead to discrimination. ""Men could want to be with us for the sake of getting the 50,000 rupees. It is like putting a price tag on our head and we are very humiliated by this,"" she says. ""I feel embarrassed because now anybody walking on the road could say, look, there's a widow! I could get 50,000 rupees if I married her,"" she says. Widows over the age of 60 years are already given a pension by the Nepalese government. But Women for Human Rights is calling on the government to extend this payment to all widows. If you see a widow walking on the street on your way to do some kind of special job, you have to return immediately because it's considered bad luck to see her    ""Our research indicates that most widows are still young and they need help because they have small children and they need money to pay school fees and take care of them,"" says Ms Thapa. Many women in Nepal lost husbands during the country's 10-year conflict, which ended in 2006. This brought an end to the traditional system of monarchy and propelled Maoist rebels into power. Campaigners are also asking the government to protect girls who are forced into marriage when they reach puberty, and who are then widowed young by disease or accidents. This traditional Hindu practice is common in the low-lying Terai district, close to the border with India. As soon as a woman becomes a widow in Nepal, she loses her status within the home and society. She is not allowed to participate in religious ceremonies and can no longer wear red clothing - which is considered auspicious - and jewellery. In fact, many widows are constricted to only wearing white and often confined to the house, where they have to take on the bulk of domestic duties. Ms Thapa, who has been campaigning for widows' rights for 14 years, says that having a widow in your home is considered to be a bad omen. ""If you see a widow walking on the street on your way to do some kind of special job, you have to return immediately because it's considered bad luck to see her,"" she says. Widows in 52 out of Nepal's 75 districts have sent petitions to their local administrations to ask them to re-think the new policy. They are demanding that the government consult them first before deciding on how to raise their status. Officials from the ministry of finance have agreed to meet Ms Thapa and other representatives from women's organisations to discuss the issue.     "
387,"Brig Gen Shmuel Zakai is believed to have told reporters that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered an operation in Gaza that the army thought unnecessary.  One report says Gen Zakai failed a polygraph test that was part of the investigation into the press leaks.  More than 100 Palestinians died in clashes after Israeli forces went into the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza in late September for 17 days.  The stated aim of the mission was to stop militants firing missiles into Israel.  Israeli news reports at the time said the army wanted to limit the incursion into Gaza, while Mr Sharon insisted it should continue.  Gen Zakai had been in charge of Israeli forces in Gaza for the past eight months.  No official reason has been given for his resignation.  Jabaliya is home to around 100,000 people and is said to be one of the most crowded places on earth.  The Gaza Strip has been occupied by Israel since it captured the territory in the 1967 war.  About 1.4 million Palestinians live in Gaza, of which 900,000 are refugees from conflicts with Israel.  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is planning to withdraw settlers and Israeli soldiers from Gaza next year, though Israel will maintain control of Gaza's borders, coastline and airspace."
388,"On the 1 November Hartlepool's Ritchie Humphreys played his 200th consecutive league game for the north-east club.  Having played three more league games since then - before Tuesday's home game with Colchester - Humphreys is now just a mere 198 games away from breaking the all-time record.  The holder of that record is Harold Bell, who between 1946 and 1955 played 401 consecutive league games for Tranmere Rovers.  Having turned 28 last week Humphreys thinks Bell's feats might be beyond him, but he has now set his sights on the record of Matt Holland, who between 1996 and 2003 played 286 league clubs with Bournemouth and Ipswich.  Since joining Hartlepool from Cambridge United in the summer of 2001, Humphreys has missed just two games for the club - a couple of LDV cup matches - when he was rested.  Modestly Humphreys says his ""quite proud"" of his record, attributing his achievement as much to good fortune as anything else.  ""You have to have a lot of luck with injuries,"" Humphreys told BBC Sport.  ""When you've got a game on a Saturday and then on Tuesday sometimes a dead leg might be enough to keep you out.  ""I don't tend to get booked so I haven't had a suspension - maybe I'm not tackling enough! - and importantly the managers that I have had here have kept faith with me.""  Since making his debut for Wednesday as an 18-year-old a decade ago Humphreys has suffered just one serious injury.  That came in March 2001 after he had left Wednesday the previous month to join Cambridge.  In his sixth game for Cambridge away at Luton he broke a bone in his foot and did not play again until the start of the 2001/2002 season when he made his debut for Hartlepool in the 1-1 draw with Mansfield.  Being versatile has helped Humphreys as well - this season he has played much of it at left-back, after Hartlepool's three first-choice defenders in that position picked up injuries.  Humphrey's believes his record might also have something to do with the influence of Paolo di Canio, Pavel Srnicek and Emerson Thome, who played with him at Sheffield Wednesday during the 1990s.  ""When the foreign players started to arrive at Hillsborough we subsconsiously picked up so many things from them.  ""The way they trained, the way they looked after themselves, refuelling at the right time, eating at the right time and drinking plenty of water.  ""All those things help you to recover quickly. And when you are playing four games over the Christmas period it's important for you to warm up and down properly.  ""Paolo was a fantastic pro, who trained as he played; Pavel was the ultimate professional and a really good athlete; while Emerson had a fantastic fitness level and looked after himself really well.  When Humphreys broke through into the Wednesday side as a 18-year-old he played in the England Under-21 side alongside Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Emile Heskey.  Those three went on to become full England internationals and still play in the Premiership, but Humphreys has no bitterness over the way his career has developed.  ""To be truthful I wasn't good enough at that level and to be honest I don't think I will ever play again in the Premiership.  ""If I was good enough to be in the Premiership I would be there.  ""Having said that I love doing what I do. This is my 10th season as professional.  ""I love the day-to-day ethic of being a player, of going in and training and playing. I wouldn't swap it for anything else in the world."""
389,"The religious site where the Babri mosque was destroyed in 1992 in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya has been a flashpoint between Hindus and Muslims for years. BBC News looks at the troubled history of the disputed holy site.  1528: A mosque is built on the site which some Hindus say marks the spot where one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, Lord Ram, was born.  1853: First recorded incidents of religious violence at the site.  1859: British colonial administration erects a fence to separate the places of worship, allowing the inner court to be used by Muslims and the outer court by Hindus.  1949: Idols of Lord Ram appear inside mosque, allegedly placed there by Hindus.

390,"A man arrested shortly after a coach ended up on its side on an embankment of the M40 in Buckinghamshire has been released on bail.  The Oxford Tube double-decker coach to London crashed in the early hours of Monday on the southbound carriageway between junctions two and three.  It is understood one of the 12 passengers on board tried to grab the wheel. No-one was seriously injured.  A 21-year-old man from Oxford has been released on bail until 25 September.  Stagecoach, which runs the Oxford Tube, said nobody was seriously hurt but the 48-year driver suffered a shoulder injury.  The company praised the driver for his actions which it said had minimised what could have been a more serious crash.  Two lanes of the M40 were closed for a time following the crash."
391,"The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court A newspaper group is paying £550,000 to the parents of Madeleine McCann after it settled a libel case over reports of her disappearance. Express Newspapers' titles, including the Daily Express, Daily Star and Sunday Express, are also printing front-page apologies. They say they were wrong to suggest the couple, of Rothley, Leicestershire, were responsible for Madeleine's death. The McCanns say the money will go to the Find Madeleine campaign. In a statement read out on behalf of the McCanns at the High Court on Wednesday, they said they were pleased that Express Newspapers had admitted the ""utter falsity"" of the numerous stories written about them over many months. Their spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, added that the allegations had caused them ""great distress"". It is understood that the sum donated to the campaign doubles the amount left in the fund. Madeleine disappeared, days before her fourth birthday, during a family holiday in the resort of Praia da Luz, in the Algarve, on 3 May last year. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, have been named as suspects in the case by Portuguese police but have always denied any involvement. Madeleine McCann went missing in Portugal in May 2007 The settlement was confirmed at a High Court hearing, although the amount of damages was not formally disclosed. It came after Wednesday's editions of the Daily Express and Daily Star both carried front-page apologies under the headline, ""Kate and Gerry McCann: Sorry"". The Express said it accepted that a ""number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up"". It also acknowledged there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support that theory. The paper added that Mr and Mrs McCann are ""completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance"". The Star said it was making a ""wholehearted apology to Kate and Gerry McCann for stories suggesting the couple were responsible for, or may be responsible for, the death of their daughter Madeleine and for covering it up"". Further apologies are expected in the publications' sister Sunday titles at the weekend. The libel action related to more than 100 stories across the four titles, including 42 printed in the Daily Express. I think this is an amazing stand-down, u-turn, by the Express newspapers    All four titles are published by the Express Newspapers group, which has agreed to all the McCanns' requests. It is also paying all their costs. A spokesman for the company said: ""We have nothing to add to what will be said in court and in our titles."" The McCanns' lawyers said that some of the newspapers' articles were ""grossly defamatory"". Richard Bilton, BBC News special correspondent, said one of the couple's representatives had said the response of the newspaper group was ""much more responsible than they were perhaps initially with these articles"". Media commentator Roy Greenslade said that for two national newspapers to carry front-page apologies at the same time was ""unprecedented"". ""I think this is an amazing stand-down, U-turn, by the Express newspapers,"" he said. The McCanns will receive a public apology, read in open court ""I think when people realise that more than 100 stories have been complained about as being grossly defamatory, it will annihilate the Express' readers sense of trust and credibility in their newspaper."" Media lawyer Paul Gilbert, from Finers Stephens Innocent, said the courts encourage early settlement of defamation cases. ""Clearly the Express' lawyers felt this was a case they should settle without a high-profile trial - which it would be - and as a result have saved considerable costs,"" he said. ""It certainly is a warning sign to newspapers in the future - if they're going to speculate, they've got to be very careful about what they speculate about."""
392,"Property prices are continuing to boom, but house sellers are increasingly reluctant to pay an estate agent a percentage of their house's value.  Last year, we paid agents £2.5bn in commissions.  Now, however, newer and cheaper ways of selling your home are springing up.  So if you're selling your house, what are your options and what are the pros and the pitfalls of trying to ditch your traditional estate agent?  Martin and Debra Bell are trying to sell their substantial house in Northumberland.  They left their high street estate agent after a year because they were not getting any potential buyers, despite paying for expensive newspaper adverts.  Now they've gone with a ""virtual"" estate agent, Housenetwork Estates.  The company offers many of the services of a traditional estate agent, but sellers have to show potential buyers around their property themselves.  Because Housenetwork does not run a chain of expensive shops, it has cut costs. It charges £199 plus VAT when you sign up and the same amount once the sale is completed.  By comparison, the Bells' original agent would have charged a commission of £10,000 if it had sold their property.  After three months with Housenetwork, the Bells have had only one viewing.  In the north-east of England, and now spreading to other regions in the country, supermarket chain Asda is selling homes.  Asda is charging 1% commission, compared with a national average of 1.5%.  Andy Lee, who lives near Newcastle, was attracted to it because he found his traditional agent intimidating. The company says that because people do not always trust estate agents, its brand will help it get into the market.  Sixty thousand customers a week walk past its in-store displays. But after three months with Asda, Andy had no offers and has now signed up with a traditional estate agent.  For those really going it alone, there are plenty of websites who will advertise your property on the internet and provide you with a ""For Sale"" sign. The rest is up to you.  Shopping around the internet, you could get the most basic service for as little as £59.  Barry Burke wanted to sell his house in east London himself and signed up with the oldest internet company, HouseWeb, which has been in business for 10 years.  Barry is a marketing man, so he was ready for the challenge. In three months, Barry had more than 30 viewings and received about five offers.  He is holding out for one nearer his asking price and is confident he will achieve it.  It's estimated that 75% of all people looking for property carry out a search on the internet. Since HouseWeb started a decade ago, many other private sale sites have sprung up.  Some, like PropertyBroker, have been around for eight years and focus on London and surrounding areas. Many other recent ones target the entire country.  Estate agents have recognised this threat and are fighting back. In 2000, they set up Rightmove, which this year was valued at more than £400m on the London Stock Exchange.  Rightmove is far and away the most viewed property site in the country. It is among the top 10 most viewed websites in the UK.  As private sales companies such as HouseWeb and PropertyBroker started to attract more customers, Rightmove wrote to its private sale customers, telling them they could no longer advertise their properties on Rightmove.  Rightmove says it cannot rely on the accuracy of the details from private sales sites, as they are not bound by The Property Misdescriptions Act, which only applies to estate agents.  However, the Money Programme found an example of an estate agent copying property details from a private sales site and placing them on Rightmove without the owner's permission.  The Money Programme informed Rightmove and it has now removed the company's adverts from its website. Rightmove said the company had failed to abide by its terms and conditions.  Peter Bolton King, the head of the National Association of Estate Agents says that despite the growth of the internet as a way of finding properties, there are still many good reasons to go with an established estate agent.  He says an estate agent brings a list of potential buyers to each sale. He also points out that viewings and negotiations are best handled by an experienced professional.  With new regulations on estate agents being introduced by the government, the reputation of the industry may well improve.  But it seems there is a genuine market out there for people who want to go it alone - and pocket the commission in the process."
393,"The shopkeeper does not have to sell the television if he does not want to. At that stage there is no contract.  The shopkeeper is making what lawyers call an 'invitation to treat', an invitation to the customer to make him an offer.  Argos does not have to sell you a television for £3.  However, if the company accepts your order electronically then there may be a valid contract.  A customer who gave Argos his credit card number received what was called a Unique Order Code. That may be proof of a contract, although Argos said all items were ""subject to availability"".  And it is also possible for the courts to declare a contract void if the seller has made a genuine mistake.  The Consumer Protection Act of 1987 makes it a criminal offence to give consumers a misleading price indication.  Shopkeepers in England and Wales can be fined up to £5000 in the magistrates' courts each time a consumer is misled. It's a defence for the shopkeeper to show he acted diligently and took all reasonable steps to avoid giving the consumer a misleading indication.  But a company could not just claim it was a mistake: Argos would need to show it had reliable systems in place designed to stop this sort of thing happening.  The fact that Argos displayed its prices on the Internet should make no difference. The Consumer Protection Act covers giving misleading price indications 'by any means whatever'.  Local trading standards officers could take action in the part of the country where Argos trades or where consumers happen to live."
394,"An undiscovered Caravaggio painting may have been found in Rome, according to the Vatican newspaper.  The painting depicts the martyrdom of St Lawrence and belongs to the Jesuits in Rome.  It will now be examined in detail by art historians to find out if it really is the work of the famous Baroque painter.  Italy celebrated the life of the great master over the weekend on the 400th anniversary of Caravaggio's death.  A gallery housing his work and several churches stayed open overnight to mark the anniversary.  An image of the work was published on the front page of the Vatican's L'Osservatore Romano on Saturday.  It shows a semi-naked man, with one arm outstretched as he leans over leaping flames beneath him.  But while the Vatican newspaper article points out that the painting is typical of Caravaggio's style - such as the perspective from which the subject is seen - it conceded that no known document mentions St Lawrence in relation to Caravaggio.  ""In certain moments, such as Caravaggio's anniversaries, it's no surprise that a lot of paintings come out that are supposedly Caravaggio's work,"" Marini told the AP news agency.  Caravaggio was born in either 1571 or 1573, according to varying scholars, and spent the last few years of his life fleeing justice in southern Italy.  Caravaggio was famed for his wild lifestyle - he was often involved in street violence, culminating in him stabbing and killing a man before going on the run in 1606.  He fled to Naples and died four years later in the town of Porto Ecole.  His works include Bacchus, The Supper at Emmaus and Sacrifice of Isaac.  A group of Italian researchers recently revealed they had found human remains found in a church in Tuscany almost certainly belong to Caravaggio."
395,"Ex-darts world champion Eric Bristow has apologised for suggesting football sex abuse victims are not ""proper men"".  Bristow had posted on Twitter that darts players were ""tough guys"" and footballers ""wimps"".  In a heated interview with host Piers Morgan on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Bristow initially defended his tweets, saying he was trying to encourage children to report abuse immediately.  He later accepted he had offended people and said: ""I am sorry for that.""  Bristow added: ""I apologise, it was mis-worded. They are not wimps.""  In a statement issued later on Wednesday, Bristow described himself as a ""bull in a China shop"" and said he now ""appreciated my wording was wrong and offended many people"".  ""It makes me furious to think that an abuser can get away with it for so long, and to so many, when they should always be looking over their shoulder in fear, waiting to be confronted,"" he said.  ""I know why I've been vilified but if one child comes forward quicker or one abuser thinks twice about the likelihood of being confronted then it will have been worth it.""  The 59-year-old was dropped by Sky Sports on Tuesday after asking why victims did not ""sort out"" their abusers ""when they got older and fitter"".  Newcastle United said they had dropped Bristow ""immediately"" from a scheduled appearance at St James' Park on 6 December and ""will not work with Eric Bristow in the future"".  His manager asked for a £5,000 fee for Bristow to appear on the BBC to discuss his comments. GMB said it didn't disclose guest contracts - and Bristow later said any money received would be donated to charity.  Nine police forces are now investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse, with more than 20 former footballers having made allegations to the Professional Footballers Association and a special NSPCC hotline receiving more than 100 calls.  The Football Association has instructed independent leading counsel Kate Gallafent QC to oversee an internal review of what it knew and when.  On Wednesday, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme reported that the FA scrapped a major review of its child protection policies in 2003."
396,"Chancellor Philip Hammond is facing calls for a Commons motion of contempt over answers he gave to Parliament on Yemen when he was foreign secretary.  Labour's Ann Clwyd has urged action after the Foreign Office amended statements and answers to questions about the conflict in the country.  In his original answer, Mr Hammond said the Saudi Arabian-led coalition's actions complied with humanitarian law.  But the Foreign Office later said it had not done any relevant assessments.  The government said errors in Mr Hammond's statement and other similar answers given by other Foreign Office ministers between January and June were not a deliberate attempt to mislead Parliament.  The UK and US have been supporting Saudi Arabia and nine other Arab nations who have been fighting rebels who seized power from the Yemeni government in 2015.  The coalition has been accused of war crimes in a number of incidents, including an airstrike on a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital in the capital Sa'ana.  In a written statement issued in January, Mr Hammond said the UK treated allegations that the coalition had violated international humanitarian law very seriously but ""our judgement is that there is no evidence that IHL has been breached"".  But a correction issued on 21 July said that Mr Hammond should have stated that ""looking at all the information available to us, we have been unable to assess that there has been a breach of IHL by the Saudi-led coalition"".  Ms Clwyd said the discrepancies in Mr Hammond's statement and those issued by other ministers were serious and she wanted to know whether the UK's approach was influenced by the fact that it was a major exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia.  She has asked the Commons Speaker John Bercow to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges to consider whether Mr Hammond and other ministers have been in contempt of Parliament by deliberately misleading MPs.  ""For some time, Saudi Arabia - using British bombs and planes - may have committed war crimes on Yemeni civilians,"" she said.  ""UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia topped £3.3bn in the first year of the Saudi-led conflict in the Yemen. We need to know the truth.""  In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""The clarifications ensure consistency with numerous other Parliamentary responses and in no way represent a change in policy.  ""The UK continues to monitor the conflict in Yemen closely and relevant information gathered from that monitoring is taken into account as part of the careful risk assessment for the licensing of exports to Saudi Arabia.""  The UN is currently trying to broker a ceasefire in the long-running conflict in Yemen, with talks taking place in Kuwait."
397,"Letters have been sent to the men's families informing them of plans to carry out the executions at the end of August, Bali prosecutors said.  The three men - Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra - were sentenced to death in autumn 2003.  But prosecutors said the execution could be delayed if the men appealed for a judicial review of their case.  Made Suratmaja, the head of Denpasar's district attorney office, told Reuters news agency that the date of the execution could not be published until it had been carried out.  But he said the men, their lawyers and their families had been sent letters notifying them of preparations for the execution.  He said the sentences would be carried out on the prison island of Nusakambangan, where the men are being held.  On Wednesday, prosecutors in East Java said they had handed letters to relatives of the two convicted men that fell within their jurisdiction.  Other officials were quoted as saying the execution would be carried out on 22 August.  Two of the three men - Amrozi and Imam Samudra - said in October 2005 that they would not seek presidential clemency and were reported to have told prosecutors they were ""ready to be executed anytime soon"".  But a lawyer for Amrozi, Wiranan Adnan, told the Associated Press news agency that he planned to file a demand for a judicial review.  He did not reveal grounds for the appeal, but other lawyers said a challenge could be filed because the men were convicted of breaking a law passed after the attacks, AP said.  More than 30 people have been convicted over the October 2002 nightclub attacks, which killed more than 200 people."
398,"Rail bosses at Virgin admit train services on Cross Country routes are being badly disrupted by the effects of severe weather and new timetables.  Virgin's new fleet of Voyager and Super Voyager trains are facing ""total disruption of maintenance schedules"", caused by slippery rails, landslips and even rough seas.  A new timetable which doubled the frequency of services, but halved the length of trains, is also leading to serious overcrowding problems.  Passengers on Virgin's cross country routes, which stretch between Penzance and Aberdeen, have suffered delays, cancellations, packed carriages and alternative bus services.  Virgin says slippery tracks caused by falling leaves have led to skidding when trains try to brake.  The skidding causes ""flats"" on the surface of wheels, forcing trains to be taken out of service for repairs.  Virgin is also modifying trains to overcome heavy seas which spray over the sea wall at Dawlish, in Devon.  Saltwater has affected electrical equipment on the roof of new trains, making the on-board computers shut down locomotive engines.  A new winter timetable has exacerbated the disruption caused by autumn weather.  Virgin has doubled frequencies on many cross country routes.  But it has introduced a 79-strong fleet of four or five car, Voyager trains, to replace the nine car, High Speed Trains which are being withdrawn.  Some services are suffering serious overcrowding, with passengers complaining of standing room only for long journeys.  Virgin admits it is reducing the number of cheap, advance purchase tickets on some trains, to persuade passengers to travel at less popular times.  Passenger groups accuse Virgin of failing to provide enough luggage space on the new trains.  They say aisles are becoming blocked by bags and suitcases.  Virgin says there is plenty of luggage space, and staff are working hard to familiarise passengers with new storage areas, such as between seats.  Passengers have also complained of buffets and toilets being out of service.  Virgin says disrupted timetables and maintenance schedules are to blame.  Failure to finish engineering work on time is adding to Virgin's difficulties.  Railtrack should have completed the upgrading of track between Wolverhampton and Stafford, increasing the line speed from 90mph to 110mph.  But the work may not be finished until Christmas.  Virgin has been forced to cancel numerous services, including 18 trains on Monday this week.  The company says it is cancelling or shortening a number of services, to try to improve punctuality over the next month."
399,"The original 1972 inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, led by Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, was immediately dismissed as a ""whitewash"" by the relatives of the victims and the wider nationalist community. Thus began a long campaign for a fresh public inquiry into the events of that day.  Indeed, the official position of the British establishment quickly distanced itself from the conclusions drawn by Widgery. The following year, the Coroner, Hubert O'Neill, called the killings ""sheer, unadulterated murder"". Then, in 1974, the Ministry of Defence made 'goodwill' payments to the families of the victims, but without accepting responsibility for their deaths.  In 1992, then British Prime Minister John Major wrote to John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's nationalist SDLP and long-time Bloody Sunday campaigner, expressing the view that the British government had ""made clear in 1974 that those who were killed on 'Bloody Sunday' should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives.""  There had also been strong pressure from the Irish government, which published an assessment of new evidence relating to Bloody Sunday in June 1997.  It was against this political backdrop that British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced in January 1998 that the events of Bloody Sunday would at last be re-examined through a new, public and independent judicial inquiry.  The Bloody Sunday Inquiry, headed by Lord Saville of Newdigate, began on 3 April 1998. In his opening speech, Lord Saville said that his duty was to seek the truth and carry out that duty ""with fairness, thoroughness and impartiality"". Oral hearings commenced at Londonderry’s Guildhall on 27 March 2000 with an opening statement by Sir Christopher Clarke QC, Counsel to the Inquiry. It was the longest in British legal history, not concluding until June of that year.  Over four-and-a-half years, the inquiry heard testimony from nearly a thousand people - more than half of them civilians. Among the most dramatic was that of Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness. He confirmed in his statement to the inquiry that he was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry at the time of the Bloody Sunday shootings, the first time he had acknowledged his IRA membership. At the time, McGuinness was the serving education minister in the devolved Northern Irish government.  Giving evidence in November 2003, McGuinness denied a claim by the British agent 'Infliction' that he had fired the first shot on the day, describing the agent as ""a fantasist"". The inquiry nonetheless found that McGuinness was ""probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this.""  The inquiry also considered fresh evidence calling into question the leadership of the British Army in Northern Ireland. Classified papers drawn up three months before Bloody Sunday by the head of the British Army, General Michael Carver, raised the prospect of an operation to ""root out the terrorists"" in so-called 'no-go' areas of Derry.  A memo from General Robert Ford, the army commander in Northern Ireland, stated: ""I am coming to the conclusion that the minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ring leaders amongst the DYH (Derry Young Hooligans), after clear warnings have been issued.""  The Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry was delivered at the Guildhall in Derry on 15 June 2010.  Lord Saville concluded that ""firing by soldiers of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number, none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury. What happened on Bloody Sunday strengthened the Provisional IRA, increased nationalist resentment and hostility towards the Army and exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed. Bloody Sunday was a tragedy for the bereaved and the wounded, and a catastrophe for the people of Northern Ireland.""  The inquiry was estimated to have cost around £200 million. It sat for 444 days and took evidence from more than 900 witnesses. Following the report, British Prime Minister David Cameron made a statement to Parliament, saying that ""what happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable"".  For the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday, the Saville Inquiry had finally vindicated those who were killed and the report was hailed as a victory for their campaign."
400,"A military spokesman said troops shot Raska Lukwiya, whom he described as the LRA's third in command, on Saturday.  Correspondents say his death casts further doubt on the resumption of talks to end the war, which has killed thousands and displaced two million.  The talks had been adjourned until Monday amid disagreement on a truce.  Raska Lukwiya was killed in a confrontation in the northern district of Kitgum, Ugandan officials said.  Mr Lukwiya and his group of fighters had staged an ambush on Friday, killing a soldier and a civilian, they said.  ""So yesterday morning we deployed our units to pursue him and Lukwiya was killed in the process,"" army spokesman Chris Magezi told the French news agency, AFP.  Mr Lukwiya was among five top members of the LRA, including the group's leader Joseph Kony, who are sought by the International Criminal Court to face charges including murder, rape and forcibly enlisting children.  The LRA has abducted thousands of children and forced them to fight since the conflict in the north began two decades ago.  Peace talks between government negotiators and LRA representatives in neighbouring Sudan were postponed at the weekend after the two sides failed to agree on an end to hostilities.  The Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, has set a 12 September deadline for thrashing out a final peace deal.  The LRA declared a unilateral truce last week but then refused to attend more talks until the government followed suit.  The government has called for a comprehensive ceasefire, which includes a demand for the rebels to provide details of their forces and deployment.  The government also wants a guarantee the LRA will not use the halt in fighting to reinforce its positions.  The talks, brokered by the government of south Sudan, had been considered the best chance of ending the 20-year-war in northern Uganda.  The LRA delegation at the talks in Juba said they were consulting with their leaders in the wake of the death of Mr Lukwiya, who they said was not the rebels' third in command.  They would issue a statement later on Sunday, they said.  The head of the Ugandan government delegation, Interior Minister Ruhakana Rugunda, said he still hoped for a quick end to the conflict.  ""We regret the loss of any Uganda at this critical time when we are making every effort to end the conflict,"" Mr Rugunda said."
401,"Rapper Lil Wayne has been sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to gun possession.  The charges were linked to his arrest in 2007 when a gun was found on his tour bus.  His lawyer said the rapper expected to be held in protective custody, separated from other prisoners, at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.  The 27-year-old Grammy-Award winning singer delivered a brief bow as he was led from Manhattan criminal court.  Lil Wayne, who has vowed to keep writing while behind bars, had already said goodbye to his fans during recent concerts and in video messages posted online.  ""He knew what he had to do, and he's doing it,"" said his lawyer, Stacey Richman.  The star - real name Dwayne Carter - could be released in about eight months if he behaves well, reports suggest.  His sentencing came after several delays. The first date was postponed to allow the rapper to have dental work.  The second had to be rearranged after a fire broke out in the New York court complex."
402,"The Atacama is well known for its lack of rainfall, but scientists are only now getting a handle on how long it has experienced low precipitation levels.  Dr Tibor Dunai from Edinburgh, UK, is working in the region to date surfaces. His team reports the existence of hyper-arid conditions in the desert have lasted at least 20 million years.  ""If you camp there, even after five days, you will notice that there are no flies because there is nothing for them to eat; that's how dry it is,"" Dr Dunai told the BBC.  Dr Dunai was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting.  There are locations in the Atacama where not a single drop of rain has been recorded by humans, and the Edinburgh University researcher has studied dry river beds he can show have had no water running through them for 120,000 years.  But it is with the general hyper-aridity conditions of the Atacama that the Scottish-based scientist is most interested. Hyper-arid zones can receive some moisture (less than a few tens of millimetres per year), although this can be delivered simply by fogs.  This is done with a technique that measures the changes in sediment grains caused by exposure to cosmic rays, high-energy particles bombarding Earth from space.  ""We found loose sediment surfaces that would be washed away by any desert rainfall and these are older than 20 million years,"" he said.  This is much older than other hyper-arid regions, such as the Dry Valleys of Antarctica (10-11 million years) and the Namib desert in Africa (5 million years).  ""The origin of the aridity in the Atacama dates back to the opening of ocean pathways - the opening between South America and Antarctica, and between Australia and the Antarctic.  ""These tectonic movements enabled cold ocean water upwellings at the western coast of South America. The cold ocean water stands in the way of precipitation along this coast.""  Dr Dunai is now looking into the theory that the dry conditions of the Atacama may have played a role in helping to drive up the Andes.  This theory proposes that the paucity of sediments running off the desert region into the ocean is denying lubrication to the Pacific and South American tectonic plates which meet just off the coast.  This causes a degree of locking and leads to greater uplift of the Andes than would otherwise be the case. It may also explain why earthquakes in the region can be so large.  ""Interlocking shear stresses build up so much and if they are released, they produce much stronger earthquakes than are seen in other areas,"" Dr Dunai explained.  ""It's a nice argument but we have to work on it to prove it, but given that the aridity is so old says at least it can be true."""
403,"A second leading member of the UVF-linked Progressive Unionists, Policing Board member David Rose, has left the party.  Mr Rose, who is a former deputy leader of the PUP, told the Belfast Telegraph the killing of Bobby Moffett had led to ""a lot of soul-searching"".  The murder of Mr Moffett, who was shot dead on the Shankill Road in May, has been widely blamed on the UVF.  The PUP leader Dawn Purvis left the party shortly after the killing.  She said she left because the PUP was ""severely restricted because of its relationship with the Ulster Volunteer Force"".  Mr Rose, who works as a teacher, said he had decided to leave after ""a long period of reflection"" following Mr Moffett's murder.  ""What that did was act as a catalyst for the party. It made a lot of people think about the direction that the party has been moving in.  ""My feeling is that the party is becoming increasingly conservative in outlook. So that, along with the fact that the Bobby Moffett murder was just plain wrong, has prompted me to take the decision to go."""
404,"Sir Chris Hoy has withdrawn from this month's cycling World Championships in Poland because of a hip injury.  The Scot picked up the problem in a crash during the keirin final at the World Cup event in Denmark in February.  He had been receiving treatment and had also modified his training programme, but has now been advised to stop riding to allow the hip enough time to heal.  He said: ""I'm hugely disappointed. This is the first time I've had to miss a major championship due to injury.""  The 32-year-old had avoided crashing and won all but one of the races he entered since 2006 before last month's accident.  ""These things happen and it was a racing incident,"" he added.  ""It is a miracle I have had around 30 races without a crash since I started riding the keirin.  ""I'm glad it didn't happen this time last year and I'm still totally focused on being in the best shape possible for London 2012.  ""This doesn't affect my long-term aim of defending my titles and I'll hopefully be back in training and competition in the near future.  ""I wish the team the best of luck in Poland.""  Hoy was competing competitively for the first time since the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and had only returned to serious training in January when the British squad spent four weeks in Australia.  He had been favourite to defend his two world titles in Poznan at the end of the month.  The five-time Olympic medallist had already won gold in the team sprint before his high-speed accident, which smashed his custom-made carbon fibre bike into pieces.

405,"Former England and Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves is in intensive care after suffering a severe stroke.  A statement from Greaves's family said the 75-year-old, who had a minor stroke in 2012, had been taken ill on Sunday.  Greaves scored 44 goals in 57 England games and a club-record 220 league goals for Tottenham having started his career at Chelsea.  ""His wife Irene and four children have asked for privacy during what is a worrying time,"" added the statement.  ""Jimmy had a minor stroke in 2012, but appeared to have made a full recovery.  ""He was due to be inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 13 May at a sell-out ceremony at White Hart Lane.""  Greaves is fourth on the list of all-time England goalscorers, behind Sir Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney.  He was part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad but originally missed out on a medal because he was injured during the tournament's group stage.  At the time, only the 11 winning players on the pitch at the end of the final received the award, although football's governing body Fifa changed that practice in 2007.  The World Cup squad players and the families of team manager Sir Alf Ramsey and other backroom staff were finally presented with medals in 2009.  Tottenham posted a message of support on their official Twitter feed shortly after the news of Greaves's stroke emerged.  ""Everyone at the club wishes Jimmy Greaves a speedy recovery after he suffered a stroke yesterday,"" the message read.  ""Our thoughts are with Jimmy and his family at this difficult time.""  Greaves scored 124 league goals for Chelsea, then a club record, between 1957 and 1961.  Chelsea tweeted: ""All at Chelsea are thinking of former Blue Jimmy Greaves and his family at this time. We wish him a full and swift recovery.""  England World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst, who scored a hat-trick in the 1966 final, said on Twitter: ""Thinking of my friend and one of our greats this morning. Wishing him all the best and hoping for a speedy recovery.""  Hurst replaced Greaves in the England team in 1966 after he injured a shin against France during the group stages.  Greaves helped Tottenham win the FA Cup in 1962 and 1967, while his career also included spells at AC Milan and West Ham United.  In the 1980s he forged a new career as a football pundit on ITV, most notably alongside former Liverpool striker Ian St John on 'Saint and Greavsie', which ran from 1985 to 1992.  Former Tottenham striker and BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Choked to read that Jimmy Greaves has had a severe stroke. One of my absolute heroes. Thoughts are with him and his family. Get well, Jimmy."""
406,"The threatened closure of Summerhill progressive school has been lifted amid remarkable scenes at the Law Courts in London. Meeting in one of the courts, pupils voted unanimously to accept an agreement with the Education Secretary, David Blunkett.    As a result, he dropped his notice of complaint and the school dropped its appeal, which had led to the court hearing before an independent schools tribunal. Pupils and staff hugged each other and wept before leaving the courts complex to open bottles of champagne. Summerhill's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, said the agreed statement - approved by the tribunal - was an ""historic document"". The statement said the minister acknowledged that the evidence from ex-pupils, parents and independent experts ""demonstrated that there did not now exist a factual situation which would entitle him to serve a notice of complaint"". The school now accepted assurances given on the minister's behalf that he did not want Summerhill struck off the register of schools - which would have meant closure - or to compel attendance at lessons, or to prevent it putting into effect the philosophy of its founder, A S Neill. The minister recognised the school had a right to its own philosophy and that any inspection should take into account its aims as an international ""free"" school.    The statement was on the understanding that the minister and schools inspectorate Ofsted had to exercise their statutory functions in relation to schools. The minister would immediately review Summerhill's status as a school marked ""TBW"" (To Be Watched). It was intended that the usual programme of Ofsted inspections would now apply. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the next full inspection would occur no earlier than 2004. The school would also be entitled to submit its own expert report to the minister at the same time. Both sides went on record as agreeing that the pupils' voice should be fully represented in any evaluation of the quality of education at Summerhill and that inspections must consider the full breadth of learning at the school - learning was not confined to lessons. It acknowledged the freedom of children to attend classroom lessons or not, in accordance with Neill's philosophy. Levels of attendance at lessons should not, it was agreed, form the only basis for judgements of the suitability and efficiency of instruction and education at Summerhill. Student Carman Cordwell, who chaired the meeting of pupils, said afterwards: ""This is our charter for freedom. It gives us the space we need to live and breathe and learn into the future. ""After 79 years, this is the first official recognition that A S Neill's philosophy of education provides an acceptable alternative to compulsory lessons and the tyranny of compulsory exams. ""With this one bound, we are free at last."" The appeal was brought on behalf of the school by the present owner and principal, Zoe Readhead, A S Neill's daughter. After the hearing, Mrs Readhead hugged pupils and staff and said: ""This is the most wonderful triumph for us. ""My father always had faith in the law, and he would be delighted at how it has brought him victory and vindication over a bureaucracy which could never cope with his ideas. She said the school had lived for a year under the ""Ofsted falsehood"" that it had mistaken idleness for liberty. ""Today's verdict refutes that defamation and shows that liberty and learning go hand in hand at Summerhill. ""We can now put all the pettiness and incomprehension to which we have been subjected behind us, and look forward to a sensible and productive relationship with Ofsted and the Department of Education."""
407,"A 10ft (3m) long fish which used to dominate the Amazon river has been fished to extinction in a number of areas, scientists have revealed.  Arapaima populations were found to be extinct in eight of the 41 communities studied, and extremely low on average.  Fishermen were trained to count the fish as part of a large-scale survey.  Researchers concluded that the effects of fishing on tropical fish was worse than previously thought.  Study results are reported in Aquatic Conservation: Freshwater and Marine Ecosystems.  Arapaima can weigh more than 28st 8lb (181kg) and are among the largest freshwater fish in the world.  They are air-breathing and come to the surface every five to 15 minutes, making them easy to catch.  Their size means they are highly sought after and are landed by fishermen using harpoons and gillnets.  A century ago the giant fish dominated fisheries in the Amazon but the researchers say overfishing has dramatically reduced their numbers.  Previously, bio economic theory predicted that fishing does not cause extinctions because fishermen inevitably move away from depleted resources.  Scientists, led by Dr Leandro Castello, from Virginia Tech, US, wanted to know how healthy the arapaima populations in the Lower Amazon region were.  They also wanted to find out whether these fisheries supported bio economic predictions or the alternative fishing-down theory which predicts that large, high-value, easy-to-catch fish will be fished to extinction.  The researchers interviewed 182 fishermen, who were considered to be ""experts"" on fisheries by their colleagues, in 81 communities covering 401.5 square miles (1040 kilometres squared) of Amazonia floodplains.  Fish counts were also carried out in 41 of those communities where interviews had been carried out. Eight fishermen were trained to count the arapaima at the moment they surfaced for air.  The census revealed that arapaima populations were depleted in 57% of the survey area, locally extinct in 19%, over-exploited in 17%, and well-managed in just 5%.  In 2% of the communities they were un-fished.  In addition to the census results, more than three quarters of the fishermen questioned said that arapaima numbers had decreased in recent years.  Almost a quarter of the fishermen in each community fished arapaima regardless of the population's status.  The research team say the results contradict conventional economic thinking and instead support ""fishing-down"" predictions.  Dr Castello said: ""Mainstream thinking has predicted that scarcity would drive up price, which would increase fishing costs and help save depleted species. But that is not what has happened.""  He said because the tropics contain many species of fish living together, there is no way to avoid catching arapaima.  ""Fishers continue to harvest arapaima regardless of population depletion. When the mature, large fish are gone, gill nets are used to harvest small fish and these capture juvenile arapaima as well. Eight communities report zero arapaima,"" Dr Castello added.  Only 27% of the communities studied have management rules for arapaima harvests. But those that did have rules that were followed by fishermen were found to have larger fish stocks.  ""Many fishing-induced extinctions in the tropics are going unnoticed because of lack of data, illegal fishing, and lack of economic alternatives for the fishers,"" Dr Castello said.  ""The time has come to apply local ecological knowledge to help assess populations, document practices and trends, and solve problems through user participation in management and conservation.""  He added that community management for arapaima is now being developed and implemented in the region.  ""There is willingness among fishers to implement management, but our efforts require more support from governmental agencies,"" he said."
408,"For Steve Norris, who ran Ken Livingstone a far closer race than expected, it had been the case of third time lucky.  His route to become the Tory candidate for London mayor became as dogged as anything Mr Livingstone had to face, although at the end of the day, Norris was at least able to say he had been elected on a one member, one vote basis.  Late last year Norris was beaten to become the Conservatives' mayoral candidate by the millionaire author Lord Archer.  But when Archer was forced to resign after the tabloid revelation that he had asked a friend to lie for him prior to a libel case, Norris was given another chance to become the Tory candidate.  Many assumed the nomination would automatically go to Norris, whose previous role as minister for transport in London appeared to make him an obvious choice.  Instead the party decided to restage the contest and Norris had to reapply, only to be almost blocked from the party's shortlist over concerns surrounding his colourful private life.  Conservative chairman Michael Ancram had to wade into the row and reinstate Norris, overriding the original decision by the party's mayoral executive to block him.  But the incident unearthed a groundswell of support for Norris, who finally became the party's candidate in January.  Like Frank Dobson, Norris is not a Londoner by birth, though he has adopted the city as his home.  He was born in Liverpool in 1945, educated at the same grammar school as Paul McCartney and George Harrison and then at Oxford.  Instead of following a career in the law, which he studied, he went into the motor trade and became a franchise-holder for Volkswagen and Audi in the 70s and 80s.  Norris had been in the Labour club at Oxford but it was as a Tory councillor that he entered politics when he was elected on to Berkshire County Council in 1977.  Five years later, he was selected from 200 applicants to stand for the Oxford East seat which he won in 1983 and held until 1987 when he became the only Tory to lose his seat in the south of England, to the current chief secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Smith.  Norris was considered for numerous by-elections the following year, including the Richmond contest which elected William Hague, and eventually won the seat of Epping Forest.  During his time in Parliament, he served as the parliamentary private secretary to three ministers before being appointed as a junior minister for transport in London in 1992.  He was then promoted in 1994 to minister for local transport and road safety but stood down at the 1997 general election in preference of earning some ""serious money"" and became director general of the Road Haulage Association.  It was a position which maintained him in the spotlight until he stood down to concentrate on the mayoral battle, although he does remain a director of a number of transport-related companies.  Norris is as candid about the reasons he left Parliament as he is about how he lost his cash made from his dealerships during the recession a decade ago.  Similarly, he is also open about the relationships with five ""mistresses"" exposed by the tabloids during the ""back to basics"" era which earned him the nickname of ""Shagger"", although he insisted the affairs stretched over 25 years.  He has two sons by his first wife Vicky, whom he married in 1969, and another son with his current wife, Emma, whom he married last month.  Norris lives in Clapham, south London, and despite his Liverpool roots, is someone who has chosen London as his adopted city - illustrated by the fact that though an Everton fan by birth, he is now a Fulham season ticket holder.  As an MP, he supported the death penalty, football identity cards, the Poll Tax, student loans and has described commuters as ""dreadful human beings"".  But his mayoral battle was fought on a more liberal social agenda.  Labelled the Tory candidate that ""dare not speak"" the party's name by his opponents, Norris stood for the repeal of Section 28 and a London which reflected and catered for its ethnic minority population.  He also called for the consideration of cannabis to be used in the treatment of medical complaints and called for police to overlook the law against ""'discreet public sex"" between homosexuals.  Many have enjoyed the return of one of the Tories' most affable warhorses back to the spotlight and despite being unable to become London's first directly elected mayor, it is unlikely Norris will remain out of the public eye for very long."
409,"The final bill for the damage caused to Glasgow by severe flooding is set to run to several million pounds, according to the city council.  In the east end, the worst affected part of the city, people have been counting the cost of the havoc caused by the torrential rain.  Many residents say they did not have home contents insurance and now face large debts.  The city councillor for the Shettleston area, George Ryan, said the flooding was caused by the Victorian sewerage system and called for action from Scottish Water.  Rescuers and clean-up staff were only able to reach 230 homes in the Greenfield area on Wednesday night.  The council said 98 properties were still experiencing problems on Thursday afternoon.  At its height on Tuesday night and early on Wednesday, 1,500 residents in 500 homes were affected.  A council spokesman said: ""The weather has improved and the water has all but disappeared.  ""We are cleaning up the sludge and officials from our social work and housing departments are visiting people to assess the situation and what they will need in terms of re-housing.  ""The bill is going to be millions of pounds but at the moment we don't know exactly how much it will be.""  On the cause of the floods, which submerged cars in the worst areas, the spokesman said: ""It is a combination of things and not one thing on its own.  ""The excessive rain and the sewage system, which is pretty old, were both factors.""  The council were today carrying out checks on underground pipes to find out why the floods were so severe, he added.  Mr Ryan said it was ""well known"" that the sewerage system in Shettleston was out of date.  He called for action to modernise the system and said the issue was raised with West of Scotland Water, the predecessor to the new unitary authority Scottish Water.  ""My concern is that this was avoidable and has been well known and well documented for quite a long time,"" the Shettleston councillor said.  ""That part of Shettleston and Greenfield is at the bottom of a valley and the Victorian sewer that runs north to south just hasn't got the capacity to deal with excess of water.  ""I can almost certainly guess that as soon as there is any kind of rainfall that there will be some more flooding in my area.  ""We've got a 19th century sewer trying to deal with 21st century problems.""  Scottish Water said it had been working closely with Glasgow City Council since Tuesday but denied that the sewer capacity was to blame.  A spokesman said: ""The flooding resulted from extremely intense rainfall in the area.  ""The limited observation of the sewer network which can be carried out at present suggested that the flooding in the Cockenzie Street area is due to the impact of surface water run-off rather than a lack of capacity in the sewer network.  ""A full investigation is currently under way to determine all the causes of flooding in the Shettleston area.""  The search has been continuing for a young man who fell into a water-filled hole at Riddrie cemetery in Glasgow's east end.  Eyewitnesses saw David Storrie, 18, disappear after the ground appeared to give way beneath him as he walked his dog during Tuesday's downpour.  Rail services and roads were particularly badly affected by the rain but the situation was continuing to return to normal on Thursday."
410,"Comber early potatoes have been granted protected geographical indication(PGI) status under European law.  The potatoes are prized for their distinctive earthy, nutty flavour and characteristic soft smooth skin.  The granting of PGI status means the new season Comber potato joins an elite group of high quality European products, including Parma ham, Champagne wine and Stilton cheese.  PGI status recognises the regional importance and distinctive characteristics of the Comber spud and means that only new season potatoes harvested from the fields of Comber and the surrounding area can be marketed as new season Comber earlies.  PGI legislation came into force in 1993 and provides for a system for the protection of food names on a geographical or traditional recipe basis.  The scheme highlights regional and traditional foods whose authenticity and origin can be guaranteed.  Under this system a named food or drink registered at a European level will be given legal protection against imitation throughout the EU.  In their application for the special status, the Comber growers pointed out the climate of the designated area means that the soil dries quicker, reducing the risk of frost in the winter months.  The area is dominated by Strangford Lough, the largest inlet in the British Isles. The soil surrounding the lough is red sandstone and gravel and means it is lighter and free draining.  This means that the growing season can start before other potato-growing regions in Northern Ireland and the potatoes can be harvested earlier than anywhere else.  The history of the designated area is synonymous with potato growing and is intertwined with the history of two Ulster-Scots families, the Hamiltons and the Montgomerys.  It is the area of the Hamilton lands and the Montgomery lands, including Comber, Greyabbey and Newtownards, where new season Comber potatoes are still grown.  The historical link with the original plantation venture is evident in that there are still a number of Hamiltons growing Comber potatoes."

412,"The leader of a hardline Palestinian militant group has blamed Israel for a car bomb attack which killed his son in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.  Ahmed Jibril, founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), said the Israeli secret service (Mossad) was behind the blast.  Forty-year-old Muhammad Jihad Jibril, Mr Jibril's eldest son, died in a large explosion when he tried to start his car in Beirut's Mar Elias district.  Israel has denied any connection to the bombing.  Speaking from his headquarters in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Mr Jibril said: ""The Mossad managed this time to assassinate my son after having tried in vain four times to do it.  ""He is now a martyr, like the Palestinians who offer their lives daily in Palestine,"" he said.  ""Not everything that blows up in Beirut has to be connected to us,"" he told Israel television.  Jihad Jibril's body was handed over to his family on Monday and carried aloft through the Palestinian refugee camp of Burj al-Barajneh in Beirut.  He is due to be buried in Syria on Wednesday.  Lebanese security sources said the bomb which killed Jihad Jibril was placed underneath the driver's seat of the Peugeot 504.  The blast tore through the car, dismembering Mr Jibril's body.  The explosion also caused damage to some buildings, but there were no reports of other casualties.  Ambulances, sirens wailing, rushed to the scene and police sealed off the area to begin an investigation into the blast.  Three arrests were made by Lebanese police.  Jihad Jibril was a commander of the PFLP-GC's military operations and is reported to have been involved in an airborne attack on Israel in 1987, which killed six Israeli soldiers.  The PFLP-GC is one of the most implacable enemies of Israel, opposing any negotiated settlement with the Jewish state.  The group has been linked to rocket attacks against Israeli targets launched from southern Lebanon, but it has not played a prominent role in the current Palestinian uprising.  Ahmed Jibril recently accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of being a ""pawn of Israel"" for his decision to allow the exile of Palestinian militants to Cyprus and to jail accused killers of Israel's tourism minister.  Lebanon has seen numerous car bomb assassinations during and after the end of its 15-year civil war in 1990, often used to settle scores between rival factions.  In January, former cabinet minister and ex-militia leader Elie Hobeika was killed, along with three of his bodyguards, in a car bomb which many Lebanese believed to have served Israeli interests.  Hobeika, who led a pro-Israeli Christian militia during Lebanon's civil war, was implicated in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians during Israel's 1982 invasion of the country."
413,"According to the orthodox view, the rings around Uranus were detected during an experiment in 1977.  Now, a scientist has re-evaluated a claim made in 1797 by astronomer Sir William Herschel that he saw rings around the seventh planet.  The claim had previously been dismissed as a mistake.  The new idea was presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Preston, UK.  Dr Stuart Eves, who works for Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, first came up the idea when he was given a framed page from an encyclopaedia published in 1815 for his birthday.  The page shows an orrery - a mechanical device detailing the relative positions and motions of planets and moons.  Made by the craftsman William Pearson, it showed the planet Uranus, with its spin axis in the correct plane, with six smaller objects spinning around it.  It was unlikely that these objects were moons. Although two Uranus satellites were found the 18th Century, the sixth moon of Uranus was not found until 1985, after Nasa's Voyager probe flew past the planet.  After researching the subject, Dr Eves found that the Pearson orrery in the encyclopaedia page was based on observations made by Sir William Herschel, who discovered the seventh planet in 1781.  When Dr Eves tracked down Herschel's notes detailing his observations of Uranus, he found the following passage: ""February 22, 1789: A ring was suspected"".  Herschel even drew a small diagram of the ring and noted that it was ""a little inclined to the red"". The Keck Telescope in Hawaii has since confirmed this to be the case. Herschel's notes were published in a Royal Society journal in 1797.  Dr Eves told BBC News: ""I was thinking, 'could he have got all of that right'? He has one ring, rather than multiple rings as there are at Saturn; it is relatively close to the planet and it's about the right size.  ""The opening angle is about right. Astronomical software indicates that it may have been slightly more open as viewed from Earth on the dates Herschel was observing,"" he added.  ""But there are reasons for thinking that the ring plane moves about a bit, and he has the major axis of the ring plane in the right direction. I started to add up all the statistics and I said: I reckon he had a point.  ""[Herschel] is not just superimposing a saturnian-style ring system on Uranus. I think it is compelling from a psychological point of view, because he really didn't have much to compare it with at the time.""  Other astronomers have dismissed the possibility that Herschel discovered rings around Uranus. They claim that it would have been far too faint for him to have seen from the ground, using contemporary telescopes.  The ring was officially discovered in 1977 during an occultation experiment. One question some will be asking is why no one saw the ring in the intervening years.  Stuart Eves thinks there may be a few reasons for this. Firstly, there are only a few windows of opportunity during which the rings present themselves to Earth.  The Cassini-Huygens mission has also observed darkening of the rings of Saturn. This may be due to dust accumulating on the icy material in the rings.  If this process is happening on Saturn, Dr Eves argues, it could be happening on Uranus. The seventh planet's rings may have been brighter in 1787, allowing Herschel to spot them from Earth. Several other effects could also cause variability in the rings, including loss of material from them.  Another factor may lie with the Earth's atmosphere. As the industrial revolution proceeded apace, light pollution and smog may have prevented subsequent observers from seeing the planet's rings.  More speculatively, a cold snap called the Maunder Minimum, which lasted from 1645 to 1715 and saw temperatures that were on average five degrees lower than today, might have removed water vapour from the atmosphere, locking it up as ice.  If the climate was still relatively cold by the time Herschel made his observations, less water vapour may have made skies clearer and therefore more suitable for astronomy."
414,"State radio in the tiny west African state of Equatorial Guinea has hailed the nation's leader as ""the country's God"".  In a programme called Bidze-Nduan (Bury the fire) which deals with ""peace, tranquillity and the order reigning in the country"" the radio declared that President Teodoro Obiang Nguema was ""in permanent contact with the Almighty"".  It said that the president was ""like God in heaven"" who has ""all power over men and things"".  The BBC's reporter in Malabo, Rodrigo Angue Nguema, says a large proportion of the national population listens to state radio and that there are no newspapers in the country.  President Nguema won the 2002 presidential elections by almost 100% to serve a third, seven-year term.  ""He can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to hell because it is God himself, with whom he is in permanent contact, and who gives him this strength,"" a presidential aide announced on the show.  The radio show, which claims to ""inform and mobilise the masses on issues of national interest"", has warned against any attempt to disrupt the peace and order which, it said, had reigned since President Obiang, 61, took power in a coup 23 years ago.  The remarks were made in a weekly programme presented by the presidential aide and broadcast in Fang, the language used by the majority ethnic group, which makes up 80% of the population of about 500,000."

Ferrari's Michael Schumacher grabbed second with Giancarlo Fisichella claiming third place in his Benetton. Coulthard's team-mate Mika Hakkinen had to settle for fourth. The Scot, who is six points behind championship leader Michael Schumacher, recorded the fastest time in his opening flying lap - just seconds before the rain came down.    I found a lucky moment. I was not expecting to be here. I would have been happy with fourth    The McLaren driver was delighted and relieved that he had taken his chance early. ""I managed to find a clean lap. It was good timing from the engineers getting me out when they did,"" said Coulthard. ""The first sector was dry, it was damp in the second but dry in the third though you had to be careful throughout. ""I will approach the start the same way as I always do. I intend to turn pole into leading coming out of the first corner. If I do that I have got a good chance of winning."" The track, which had been flooded on Friday, took its toll again as the wet weather forced the cars to slow down. Local favourite Schumacher left it very late to claim the other place on the front row. The German was in fourth for the majority of the session after Mika Salo's Sauber had held him up on his first flying lap.    I intend to turn pole into leading coming out of the first corner - if I do that I have got a good chance of winning    ""I found a lucky moment. I was not expecting to be here. I would have been happy with fourth,"" said Schumacher. ""We have been competitive all weekend and I am feeling confident for tomorrow."" Schumacher's team-mate Rubens Barrichello drove off the circuit on his opener forcing him to drive the German's car in order to try a record a qualifying time for Sunday's race. The Brazilian left it until the final few moments of the session to record a time which will see him start in 18th on the grid. And the drama did not end there after it was announced that Heinz-Harald Frentzen had only 15 minutes in which to go out and qualify, after his initial effort was discounted because he had missed a chicane. But Frentzen, like Barrichello, took his place for Sunday's race, albeit well down the grid. Britain's Johnny Herbert, who by his own admission has had a rotten weekend, took advantage of avoiding the rain early to start eight on the grid while Jaguar team-mate Eddie Irvine is 10th.

416,"A man has been jailed for 18 weeks for sending abusive messages on social networking sites.  Sean Duffy, from Reading, Berkshire, posted hurtful remarks on pages set up in remembrance of girls who had died.  His victims were the bereaved relatives of people he did not know, and included the family of Worcester teenager Natasha MacBryde who killed herself after being bullied.  Duffy pleaded guilty to two counts of sending a communication of an indecent or offensive nature.  The charges related to Facebook and YouTube posts about Miss MacBryde, 15, who Duffy had never met.  But exactly what constitutes trolling, who does it, and who does it affect?  Trolling is described by Oxford Dictionaries Online as an ""informal term"".  It means to send or submit a provocative email or posting with the intention of inciting an angry response.  Fevzi Turkalp, a technology expert from gadgetdetective.com says trolling is often used in chatrooms and online forums, especially in the technology world.  ""Someone will go onto an Apple website and say something derogatory about Apple, knowing full well people on there will be fans of Apple, in order to provoke a response,"" he said.  However, there is a darker side to trolling, in which people take advantage of anonymity to make hurtful and offensive remarks.  ""People feel protected by anonymity and the true nature of people comes to the fore,"" said Mr Turkalp.  It is at this point that trolling can also descend into cyberbullying.  Cyberbullying is defined by Mr Turkalp as ""a repetitious and malicious activity by one person or a group of people against another individual"".  In the case of Miss MacBryde, her bereaved family and friends were targeted by Duffy's trolling.  Duffy posted messages on a remembrance page set up by Miss MacBryde's friends.  In one of the posts he called the teenager a slut.  He also posted a video on YouTube, entitled Tasha the Tank Engine, showing the children's character Thomas the Tank Engine with Miss MacBryde's face.  Miss MacBryde had thrown herself under a train after being cyber-bullied in a separate incident.  In another cyberbullying case, Carney Bonner, 17, told BBC Berkshire in March how he almost ""slit his wrists"" due to being bullied on Facebook as a 14-year-old.  And, although it is commonly believed that teenagers are the main victims of cyberbullying, teaching unions also report a rise in incidences against staff.  Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT, the largest teachers' union, said pupils had started to use ""sophisticated tools"" against teachers.  ""Misuse of internet sites can destroy teachers' confidence and professional reputation and provide yet another vehicle for false allegations against staff.  ""New cases of abuse, harassment and humiliation are emerging all the time."""

418,"Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine has scrapped the controversial poll tax and replaced it with a property tax. Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine has scrapped the controversial poll tax and replaced it with a property tax. The new council tax will involve a single bill for each household based on two elements - the number of adults living there and the value of the property. The government's announcement is already being hailed as a major u-turn - coming only a year after the tax was introduced. It follows massive public opposition, which culminated in a riot in central London in March last year, when 100,000 took part in a rally against the levy. The new tax should reflect people's ability to pay, be easy to collect and be seen to be fair   The unpopularity of the tax is said to have contributed to the downfall of Margaret Thatcher last November. One of John Major's first tasks as her successor was to appoint Michael Heseltine with a view to dismantling the poll tax and introducing a new charge. Under the terms of the council tax, houses will be allocated to one of seven bands, but it is yet to be decided whether the charge will relate to capital or rental value. In a 22-minute statement to the House Of Commons, Mr Heseltine said: ""In spite of the comprehensive system of income-related rebates, and the reduction scheme we devised, the public have not been persuaded that the community charge is fair. ""The new tax should reflect people's ability to pay, be easy to collect and be seen to be fair."" Under the community charge, everybody made a fixed payment to their local authority, regardless of their means. It will be gradually phased out and replaced by April 1993. Labour MPs believe the Tories have been forced into a humiliating climbdown. Shadow Environment Secretary Bryan Gould said: ''We have just heard the most complete capitulation, the most startling U-turn and most shameless abandonment of consistency and principle in modern political history.'' Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, supported his comments and said the Government was leaping ''out of the fying pan into the fire'' by combining the principles of the two most unpopular taxes - rates and poll tax. Meanwhile, many Tory MPs are concerned that the new tax will create losses for many people, offsetting any electoral gains for those hit hardest by the old poll tax. Southern Conservative MPs also claim that the property element will mean big losses for their constituents. But Mr Heseltine argued that regional variations in property prices would not be allowed to produce disproportionate bills. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont has tried to ease the current burden created by the poll tax by raising VAT in the budget this week in order to reduce bills by an average of £140 per head. The move has caused chaos for local councils who must now recall many bills that have already been sent out. Further details of the property tax will be unveiled after Easter.  The council tax was introduced in 1993. The charge was payable by all adults and was made up of the property value and the number of adults living in it. But in 2003 anger at the big increases in council tax bills led to mass protests - mainly by pensioners, many of who refused to pay the average 12.9% increases. All three main political parties have pledged to either reform or replace the council tax to make it fairer to all. The Labour Government wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it, possibly by introducing a greater number of council tax bands. In 2005, with the prospect of a general election looming, the Conservatives promised to reduce council tax bills for pensioners. The Liberal Democrats want to scrap the tax and replace it with a form of local income tax."
419,"An 80-year-old venue called The Ritz in Yorkshire has been ordered to change its name or face legal action by the owners of the famous London hotel.  Glenn Smith, who runs The Ritz in Brighouse, received a letter demanding he rename the music venue and surrender a number of internet and social media accounts.  The venue has operated under the name since 1937.  The Ritz in London declined to comment when approached by the BBC.  Mr Smith said he thought the initial email from lawyers acting for the hotel, which opened in 1906, was a scam.  But he later realised it was serious when a hard copy of the letter arrived in the post.  ""Not only do they want us to change the name but they want us to surrender all our domains, our Twitter and our Facebook,"" he said.  ""It will completely shut us off from the outside world and make it almost impossible to promote events in the future.""  He said the venue had worked hard at building an online presence and any change of name could affect its future.  ""We are working to see how we can get around this but at the moment the future is looking very bleak,"" he said.  ""How can we generate income without the events and how can we have the events without generating interest on the internet?""  In 2012 a wedding venue in Northamptonshire, called The Ritz, was forced to change its name to the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz following a similar request.  Owner Kris Malde said: ""I feel very sorry for Mr Smith. He's trying to to earn a living. Nobody is going to mistake the Yorkshire Ritz for the one in London."""

421,"Belgium has sworn in a new government, ending a record-breaking 541 days of political deadlock.  New Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo was sworn in by King Albert II at the royal palace along with his 12 cabinet ministers and six secretaries of state.  Mr Di Rupo, a French-speaking Socialist, took the oath of office in French, Dutch and German - reflecting language sensitivities in the country.  The Europe crisis is thought to have spurred politicians to find a solution.  Belgium had been run by a caretaker administration since the last government resigned in April 2010.  The delay in forming a new government revolved around arguments over budget and immigration issues, but originally started with a row over the distribution of voting rights between the French-speaking and Flemish communities, the BBC's Matt Cole in Brussels reports.  Belgium now holds the modern-day record for the country which has gone the longest without a government - beating previous title holder Cambodia by 182 days.  The situation had been as much a source of amusement as anger among Belgians, our correspondent says.  Demonstrations calling on politicians to resolve the crisis had been held, but there had also been more light-hearted protests including a group who refused to shave their beards until an administration was formed, he adds.  Politicians have been under pressure from financial markets and ratings agencies to create an effective government capable of carrying out structural reforms and reducing debt.  Last month, ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Belgium's credit rating to AA from AA+, which could make it more expensive for Belgium to borrow in future.  This is thought to have been the catalyst for the six parties now in coalition to finally agree a new administration headed by Mr Di Rupo.  Mr Di Rupo, 60, is Belgium's first French-speaking prime minister in three decades and the first Socialist to take the premiership in Belgium since 1974.  Didier Reynders, who held the role of finance minister in the caretaker administration, will swap portfolios with the temporary Foreign Minister Steven Vanackere, said the palace statement."
422,"Venezuela has withdrawn its ambassador to Lima in response to Peru's decision to grant political asylum to an opponent of President Hugo Chavez.  The Venezuelan foreign ministry said Peru's decision to grant Manuel Rosales asylum constituted a ""mockery of international law"".  He faces corruption charges which he says are baseless and went into hiding when the charges were filed last month.  Venezuela's foreign ministry said in a statement that Peru should have detained and extradited Mr Rosales.  The ministry said Venezuela was evaluating its diplomatic relations with Peru.  Earlier, Peruvian Foreign Minister Jose Garcia Belaunde announced that asylum had been granted to Mr Rosales, who arrived in Lima a week ago.  The decision was part of Peru's long-standing commitment to international law, he said.  The Venezuelan foreign ministry, however, called Peru's move a ""mockery of international law, a strong blow to the fight against corruption and an offence to the people of Venezuela"".  Peruvian President Alan Garcia is a Washington ally and has clashed with Mr Chavez - a fierce critic of the US - in the past.  Last year Mr Rosales was elected mayor of Venezuela's second biggest city, Maracaibo.  He is facing multi-million-dollar corruption charges relating to a previous term as governor of Zulia state.  Mr Rosales and his supporters say he is the victim of a political witch-hunt  Government supporters accuse him of taking part in a short-lived coup against Mr Chavez in April 2002.  Mr Rosales has insisted that it was an honest mistake made in the confusion that followed the announcement of the president's resignation."
423,"During a 45-minute televised address, Queen Sirikit spoke of the suffering of ordinary Thais caught in the violence.  Earlier, Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra blamed the violence on Thai Muslims who had studied Islam abroad.  He denied suggestions that foreign organisations were behind the attacks, which have left 30 dead in the last three weeks.  Queen Sirikit was addressing politicians and other community leaders at the Royal Palace in Bangkok on Tuesday, but her words were broadcast to the nation.  Thailand's revered royal family rarely becomes engaged in the public business of politics and the decision to broadcast her declaration was a break with tradition.  While the queen has a strong bond with southern Thailand - she spends months in the Muslim majority provinces every year - her role is normally one of quiet diplomacy.  She urged people to help the government solve the problems in the south and to show disapproval at the violence against innocent people.  She recounted the stories of police officers and civil servants who have died in ambushes and attacks by so-called militants.  At least 500 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and militants this year, including at least 85 Muslims at a protest last month in Takbai, in Narathiwat province.  An investigation is underway into what happened at Takbai. The UN has urged that it be swift, independent and thorough."
424,"The chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph has resigned from the paper, accusing it of a ""form of fraud on its readers"" for its coverage of HSBC and its Swiss tax-dodging scandal.  Peter Oborne claimed the paper did not give due prominence to the HSBC story because of commercial interests.  Newspapers had a ""constitutional duty"" to tell readers the truth, he said.  The Telegraph called Oborne's statement an ""astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo"".  In a lengthy statement published on the OpenDemocracy website, Mr Oborne said he had already resigned from the paper ""as a matter of conscience"" because of a number of its editorial decisions.  The Telegraph describes it as astonishing. They are not alone.  Amongst responses from journalists and news executives it's described as ""eye-popping"", ""stunning"", ""explosive"" and from professor Jay Rosen at New York University ""one of the most important things a journalist has written about journalism lately"".  The Daily Telegraph is accused of a ""sinister"" betrayal of its readers.  Stories about HSBC, Tesco and China are said to be placed or sidelined for commercial reasons.  But this is not just a parting swipe at an employer by a disgruntled member of staff, it's an explosion of anger about an issue that is worrying journalists across the industry.  Newspapers are in a state of crisis. The Telegraph has seen its print sales drop by around half over the last 10 years.  The less we spend on papers, the more our news will have to be paid for by companies.  And in the online world, the clear boundaries between news and adverts do not feel quite so clear anymore. Many adverts are looking more and more like news stories.  But Peter Oborne has gone further, saying that ""shadowy"" executives are interfering on an ""industrial scale"" with basic news coverage.  This is strong stuff and the Telegraph denies it all - saying it's all unfounded and full of inaccuracy.  Of course, these are turbulent times. The Telegraph is, like almost every other paper, having to reinvent itself.  People are going to get upset. But whatever the truth of these particular allegations - there are issues here not limited to just one newspaper.  He said he had intended to ""leave quietly"" until he saw the paper's coverage of HSBC and its Swiss banking arm.  In comparison to the coverage of the story in other national newspapers, ""you needed a microscope to find the Telegraph coverage"", Mr Oborne said.  Mr Oborne said ""after a lot of agony"" he had come to the conclusion he had a ""duty"" to comment publicly, saying the Telegraph was a ""significant part of Britain's civic architecture"".  He said he had been told HSBC was an ""extremely valuable"" advertiser by what he called a ""well-informed insider"".  ""A free press is essential to a healthy democracy,"" Mr Oborne said.  ""There is a purpose to journalism, and it is not just to entertain. It is not to pander to political power, big corporations and rich men.  ""Newspapers have what amounts in the end to a constitutional duty to tell their readers the truth.""  Mr Oborne later told Channel 4 News he believed he spoke ""for the vast majority of Telegraph staff"" in saying he had no confidence in Murdoch McLennan, the paper's chief executive, and the Barclay brothers who own the paper.  A Telegraph spokesman said the ""distinction between advertising and our award-winning editorial operation has always been fundamental to our business"".  They added: ""We utterly refute any allegation to the contrary.  ""It is a matter of huge regret that Peter Oborne, for nearly five years a contributor to the Telegraph, should have launched such an astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo, on his own paper."""
425,"A Dutch court has fined the owner of the Netherlands' biggest cannabis-selling coffee shop 10m euros (£9m, $13.3m) for breaking drugs laws.  Owner Meddie Willemsen, who was tried along with 15 staff of the Checkpoint coffee shop in Terneuzen, was also sentenced to a 16-week prison term.  He was convicted for keeping more than the maximum tolerated amount of 500g (18oz) of drugs at the cafe.  Checkpoint served up to 3,000 people a day before being closed last year.  On a couple of occasions, police found 200kg (440lb) of cannabis when they raided the coffee house.  Willemsen was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, but was released as he had already spent the time in jail ahead of the trial.  He and his staff were convicted of breaking drugs laws, exporting drugs and membership of a criminal organisation.  The 10m euro fine was lower than the 28m euro fine prosecutors had asked for because of the ""role of the authorities"" in allowing Checkpoint to grow unchecked.  ""Checkpoint could not have expanded as much as it did without collaboration from the municipality of Terneuzen,"" a court statement said.  The town, close to the Belgian border, put up road signs showing the way to the Checkpoint and built a car park near it to reduce traffic congestion in town.  Though technically illegal, the Netherlands decriminalised the consumption and possession of under 5g (0.18oz) of cannabis in 1976 under an official ""tolerance"" policy."

Based on the novel of the same name by South African writer JM Coetzee, it was Glass' 21st work for the stage.  British baritone Richard Salter was praised for his lead role in the opera dealing with civil rights.  Examining state-sponsored torture and repression, the opera explores the way in which modern-day white society is coming to terms with its legacy of centuries of repression of indigenous black cultures.  Glass previously said he saw the opera as a critique of President Bush's administration and its war against Iraq.  However its sets and costumes remain timeless, underlining the universality of Glass' themes. Its music contains all the characteristics of the ""minimalist"" style that made him famous.  Glass' 27-year career includes an Oscar nomination for his work on Martin Scorsese's film Kundun in 1998.  Waiting for the Barbarians is due to be performed six times at Erfurt Theatre before moving to Amsterdam next spring then to Austin, Texas, in January 2007."
427,"It was perhaps the most spectacular end to British rule of any of the country's former colonies. It was perhaps the most spectacular end to British rule of any of the country's former colonies. The handover of Hong Kong from its rulers of 150 years to the Chinese took place at midnight on 1 July 1997. The ceremony was accompanied by the sort of pomp and grand symbolism expected of an aging empire giving up its last great possession. Tens of thousands partied, hundreds of fireworks exploded - and the flags even had an artificial breeze to flutter in. Wow eight years ago today, Hong Kong was ceded back to China. It still sometimes seems like yesterday! It was one of the rainiest days I have ever experienced (matching London's best rainy day) and everyone was buzzing about the handover. Some were optimistic but some were scared and left. I was in the middle just observing events as an outsider! It was really sad to see Chris Patten cry as the Union Jack was pulled down and up went the PRC flag. It really did not hit until then that I was watching history in the making that went back to the 1840s! What was most exciting to me was the countdown clock and seeing everyone count down especially the last few seconds. It is quite ironic that the handover was Tony Blair's first big occasion as British PM and to see that he still is in power is remarkable!   Sunny, UK I was living and working in HK during the handover. I remember vividly the firework display over the harbour. I was in the Admiralty District of Hong Kong Island at the time. The thing that sticks in my mind the most was when we left the display to watch the soldiers arriving from China. They were all stood to attention in the back of open trucks driving through the New Territories and Kowloon. The amazing thing was that they were rigid (like statues) even in the driving rain. This was the first time I felt that Hong Kong was going to change. The seriousness of the soldiers' faces along with the rhetoric of the Chinese government made me feel an overwhelming sadness that one of the last colonies of The British Empire was no more.   Dougie, UK I remember the handover well. It felt something like a New Year party, only a whole lot more significant. And then there was the rain. One thing sticks out in my mind more than any other: watching the news reports about the rain after we got back home. The BBC report said the skies were crying for Hong Kong. The Chinese reports said the rain had come to wash away the last vestiges of colonialism from the land. Our local Hong Kong report, however, simply said there was a lot of rain. Which, to me, was a perfect summary of the whole event.   Chris, USA It was amazing fire works from the English side were outclasses by those from China, reports coming in the Chinese troop are coming threw New Territories, family members in England calling mobiles with concerns over a news report in England, worrying because I lived in new territories . New era the first day living in China. Still the same - no troops, everything running as normal, what was the hype. All I can say is I am proud to have been in Hong Kong pre, during and post. I hope China keeps Hong Kong the way it was a successful business hub of South East Asia.  Darren Mulqueen, Thailand I was a member of the team that set off the display from three barges in the harbour. 25,000 fireworks lit up the sky in just 20 minutes, made all the more surreal as each explosion sparkled through the pouring rain. Each time a volley of shells was fired, the whole barge was driven down into the water a foot or so, leaving you momentarily suspended in the air above the deck. The display ended with the a huge bang as the deafening noise of six titanium maroons echoed around the Hong Kong skyscrapers. Then all of a sudden all was quiet, aside from the sound of cheers and applause floating across the harbour. An unique evening in every sense.   Chris, Britain I witnessed the handover ceremonies from on board a boat on Victoria Harbour. During the firework display boats were held back behind safety lines. We dodged and weaved to get a better view of the fireworks through the increasing clouds of smoke. We watched the distant lights of the British Empire travel towards the horizon   After midnight and a deafening salute from all the ships, we followed Britannia and its flotilla of remaining British Naval ships as they left Hong Kong for the last time. It was a spectacular sight with the fire ships spouting great arcs of water. We eventually stopped following the ships after exiting the eastern end of the Harbour. We were the last boat in pursuit. Alone in the dark on a quiet sea, we watched the distant lights of the British Empire travel towards the horizon. It was a deeply emotional experience.   Simon Church, Hong Kong Our party started about 1800 on an open-top double-decker bus to take us to the top hotels in Kowloon. We cried and partied till 0600, then wet and weary drudged home. It was an eerie feeling, nothing to do with losing Hong Kong, but losing the contact of close friends who were the same nationality. I never had any race problems there, in fact quite the opposite. Britain never controlled HK, the HK people did and a good job they did too. I always try to ""call in"" on my way back to my present home in South Korea but nothing compares to the magic and delight of HK.   Howard Parry, UK & S. Korea All we had were tears and sadness   Hong Kong people don't want to be under control of the China government. We felt very sad to see the British Government were leaving us that day. Fireworks were not for us, smiles on the Chinese faces were not for us, every celebration was not for us. All we had were tears and sadness.   Virginia, Hong Kong The police tried to make everyone walk in circles close to the fireworks display; there just wasn't enough room to stand still on the harbour side. Instead we were on a ""rota"" to watch the fireworks. It was a bizarre mix of drenched people: millions of Chinese who just wanted to see the fireworks, young British crying at the end of the empire, and Japanese tourists taking photos of the British police officers, wrongly believing it must be their last day of work. I stood at the democracy protest rally and it was me who spotted the police quietly change their cap badges - I was the only person to stand behind them during the rally - and thereby change their allegiances. I pointed out to a reporter standing in front of them. One policeman lent me his badge with the British crown and I took a photo wearing it.   Iain Cowie, UK I sang Land of Hope and Glory as loud as I could and got smacked round the head by my uncle    I was 16 when at the time of the hand over, and had flown to Hong Kong from the UK only three days earlier. Since I was with my aunt and uncle in HK, I stood on the Kowloon (Chinese) side. How I wish I was standing on the Island side with the British. I sang Land of Hope and Glory as loud as I could and I got smacked round the head by my uncle who told me to shut up as it was seen to be supporting British rule! Although Chinese by origin, I didn't want HK returned to China.   Richard Tang, UK We all went to a friends house on the Peak, hoping for the best view on the Island. Then - about 30 minutes before the ceremony - the clouds came down and completely covered the area - we couldn't see a thing! However, it was a good party with plenty of booze!   Thomas Jackson, Hong Kong I was in Hong Kong during the handover. It was one of the saddest days of my life. I loved Hong Kong as a British colony. And look at it now.   Phil, US I was quite young when Hong Kong was handed back to the Chinese back in 1997. At the time I was living in Taiwan, and being so young could not understand the strange relationship between Taiwan and China, after all, what to an eight-year-old is the difference between a 'People's Republic' and a 'Republic'? It confused me. They were pointing huge forces at each other, separated by a sliver of sea. I didn't know why Hong Kong was being given back. My young mind became quite furious that one of the last bastions of Britain's power overseas was being given up, without a fight, to the Chinese, not understanding that we'd taken it forcibly in the first place. Watching Chris Patten and Prince Charles on TV, in Hong Kong, was probably one of, when I look back at it, the most defining factors in a quest to understand politics!   Tom Thistlethwaite, England  The handover ceremony was accompanied by a torrential downpour"
428,"Part of the west London building was filled with smoke and the electricity was cut off, leaving the Philadelphia Orchestra unable to play on Sunday.  They will return on Monday to perform the fifth symphonies of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, conducted by German-born Christoph Eschenbach.  Tickets will be refunded for Sunday's event, which will not be rearranged.  Those who bought tickets from the Royal Albert Hall by telephone or online need take no action, the BBC said, as they will receive their money back this week.  Anyone purchasing tickets with cash from the box office has been advised to post them back to the venue.  A Late Night Prom will also go ahead as planned."
429,"Blackburn Rovers have terminated the contract of forward El Hadji Diouf, Rovers boss Steve Kean has confirmed.  Diouf fell out with Kean after returning late for pre-season training and the club have now decided to cut their losses.  ""Dioufy has left the club. I think we reached a mutual-consent termination of his contract last night,"" the Scot said on Thursday.  ""He will be moving on to pastures new and we wish him all the best.""  The former Bolton and Liverpool forward had indicated his desire to leave the club last week, after hitting out at Rovers boss Kean.  ""When he was coach, he used to talk to me all the time,"" Diouf said. ""He'd tell me I was the club's best player. Then when he became the manager, he changed his opinion of me.""  The controversial Senegal forward spent the second half of last season on loan at Rangers but they did not take up the option of signing him permanently.  Kean, however, was pleased to have kept hold of his key players despite plenty of speculation surrounding Chris Samba and Steven Nzonzi - while he also added centre-back Scott Dann and strikers Yakubu and Jordan Slew to his squad before the transfer window closed.  And he had more good news for Rovers fans after revealing a ""deal in principle"" had been reached with Junior Hoilett on a new long-term contract which should be finalised in the next 24 hours.  ""There was interest in Steven but we fought it off,"" added Kean. ""There were no bids that came in for Chris Samba and although there was plenty of speculation that bids would come in they never materialised.  ""I gave Chris a couple of days off intentionally to make sure he was out of the country and we are delighted he is still here."""
430,"Tesco has suspended four executives, including its UK managing director, after the supermarket overstated its half-year profit guidance by £250m.  That would be almost a quarter of its expected profit for the period.  It has launched an investigation headed by Deloitte, and says it is now working to establish the impact of the issue on its full-year results.  ""Disappointment would be an understatement,"" said Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis.  Mr Lewis, who only took the helm on 1 September, said it was ""a serious issue"", but insisted ""it doesn't take away from what I'm able to build at Tesco"".  The news prompted a plunge in Tesco's share price, which closed 11.6% lower at 203p.  As a result almost £2.2bn was wiped from Tesco's value on the stock market.  Mr Lewis said ""a number of people"" had been suspended from duty ""to facilitate the fullest and deepest investigation possible"", but said this was not ""disciplinary or an admission of guilt"".  UK managing director Chris Bush is one of those suspended, according to Radio 5 Live presenter Adam Parsons.  Mr Lewis said Robin Terrell, Tesco's multi-channel director, would be ""stepping in and running and leading the UK leadership team"", but he refused to confirm that Mr Bush had been suspended.  Tesco is also believed to have suspended its UK finance director Carl Rogberg, its food commercial director John Scouler and the head of food sourcing Matt Simister.  Mr Lewis said the issue was ""something completely out of the ordinary"" and his priority was to carry out ""a full and frank investigation"".  ""We will take decisive action as the results of the investigation become clear,"" he added.  Tesco also confirmed that there had been no chief financial officer (CFO) at the group since its current CFO Laurie McIlwee left just over a week ago, following his resignation in April.  Marks and Spencer's CFO, Alan Stewart, was announced as Mr McIlwee's replacement in July, but is not due to join Tesco until December.  Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent rebuffed criticism that he should have discovered the issue sooner.  ""Things are always unnoticed until they have been noticed."" he said. ""The shareholders will have to decide for themselves whether I'm part of the solution or part of the problem.""  Breaking accounting rules to exaggerate profits is a cardinal sin as far as investors are concerned and Tesco has been punished severely with shares falling more than 10% at one stage today.  The scale of the discrepancies which happened in its core UK food retail business poses serious questions on how this important UK company has been run.  In effect this FTSE 100 company has been operating without a CFO - their replacement for Laurie McIlwee is not due to start for several weeks.  Questions must also be asked of the former boss Philip Clarke, the entire board of directors and the company's auditors.  Taken in isolation this incident would be serious, but added to falling sales, profit warnings and a share price at 10-year lows, it suggests this once formidable retailer is in a state of disarray.  The new boss, Dave Lewis, will hope the investigation he has launched will help put this latest disaster behind him as he tries to rebuild the relationship with customers and investors.  On 29 August, Tesco had said it expected its trading profit for the six months to 23 August to be about £1.1bn, lower than management had expected.  In its latest statement, Tesco said the profits overstatement was ""principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs"".  It also said some of the error - which referred to its expected profits for the six months to 23 August - was due to the timing of the accounting of payments between suppliers and Tesco.  Mr Lewis said this meant ""an element of"" expected revenue from its suppliers had been ""reported in the wrong time period"".  ""It's about revenue received versus when the activity took place,"" he added.  Tesco said ""an informed employee"" had alerted the board to the issue on Friday, and added it had already informed the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.  As a result of the problem, Tesco has pushed back the release of its interim results to 23 October, from 1 October.  Deloitte will carry out its investigation with Freshfields, the group's external legal advisers.  Tesco's usual auditors are PWC. The accountancy firm declined to comment.  Shares in Tesco reached an 11-year low in August after the firm cut its full-year profit forecast to £2.4bn from £2.8bn.  The supermarket group has been battling falling sales and a decline in its market share as discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl have gained in popularity.  Previous chief executive Philip Clarke stood down in July after his attempts to revive Tesco's fortunes through a £1bn turnaround plan failed.  Cantor Fitzgerald said it had already warned last November that it believed Tesco was ""demanding/taking money from suppliers trading accounts"".  ""We believed Tesco had been overstating its UK commercial gross profit by £200m+ per annum, via deducting monies from suppliers' trading accounts or extending payment dates without notice,"" it added.  Professor Ajay Bhalla of Cass Business School said ""things could not be worse for Tesco's management and shareholders"".  ""The incoming CEO - Mr. Lewis has a momentous task in hand. Re-building the internal culture and market reputation will be his number one priority,"" he said.  And Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said he was ""flabbergasted"" by Tesco's announcement.  ""Such an announcement is not the stuff of a well operated FTSE-100 organisation. This development may raise, indeed must raise, much more fundamental questions over the chairman's (Richard Broadbent) position and the nature, composition and extent of the board."""
431,"Deputy Liberal Democrat leader Simon Hughes is to be investigated amid claims he breached parliamentary rules.  The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is to consider whether the MP breached rules by failing to fully declare a £10,000 donation received by his local party in south London.  Mr Hughes's spokesman said the money, from a scrap metal firm, was registered with the Electoral Commission.  There is no suggestion that Mr Hughes benefited personally from the donation.  In September, in an address to a parliamentary committee, Mr Hughes referred to Southwark Metals.  Records submitted to the Electoral Commission show Mr Hughes's local party received a donation from the metal recycling firm in May.  However, he did not acknowledge this in his remarks to the committee.  Neither did there appear to be any reference to it in the Register of Members' Financial Interests, said BBC political correspondent Chris Mason, although the rules do not require this in every instance.  A Lib Dem spokesman said the party's deputy leader would ""co-operate fully"".  The spokesman said Mr Hughes was committed to being transparent.  Our correspondent said: ""This may amount to no more than a human error, but is nonetheless embarrassing for Simon Hughes."""
432,"An Ulster Covenant signature believed to have been written in blood almost certainly wasn't, according to a test carried out on behalf of the BBC.  The forensic science test was carried out by Dr Alastair Ruffell of Queen's University, Belfast.  ""I'm 90% sure this isn't blood, but there is that margin of error,"" he said.  Major Fred Crawford wrote on his own copy of the Covenant oath: ""I signed at 3:45 in City Hall in my own blood"".  Dr Ruffell said that it was almost certain that it was not blood but added there was a margin of error because ""this material has been uncontrolled for 100 years"".  For the test, carried out for the BBC's Knowledge and Learning team, Major Crawford's signature was injected with a small amount of Luminol.  This substance reacts with iron in blood's haemoglobin to produce a blue-white glow.  The test is very sensitive and can detect tiny traces even in old samples.  ""Some years ago we did a test in the Colorado desert where they put some blood on some rocks and we went back ten years later and we were able to find the blood using the Luminol test,"" said Dr Ruffell.  ""The iron in the blood degrades very slowly.""  Unionist MLA Robin Swann is unconvinced by the results of the test.  ""I'm confident enough that the 10% is enough for me to say that Fred Crawford signed the Ulster Covenant in his blood,"" he said.  Major Crawford played a key role in the resistance to Home Rule by smuggling more than 25,000 rifles and millions of rounds of amunition from Germany to Larne, County Antrim, to arm the newly-formed Ulster Volunteer Force."
433,"Condemned as a dead language, Manx - the native language of the Isle of Man - is staging an extraordinary renaissance, writes Rob Crossan.  Road signs, radio shows, mobile phone apps, novels - take a drive around the Isle of Man today and the local language is prominent.  But just 50 years ago Manx seemed to be on the point of extinction.  ""If you spoke Manx in a pub on the island in the 1960s, it was considered provocative and you were likely to find yourself in a brawl,"" recalls Brian Stowell, a 76-year-old islander who has penned a Manx-language novel, The Vampire Murders, and presents a radio show on Manx Radio promoting the language every Sunday.  The language itself has similarities with the Gaelic tongues spoken in the island's neighbours, Ireland and Scotland. A century ago, ""Moghrey mie"" would have been commonly heard instead of good morning on the island.  ""In the 1860s there were thousands of Manx people who couldn't speak English,"" says Stowell. ""But barely a century later it was considered to be so backwards to speak the language that there were stories of Manx speakers getting stones thrown at them in the towns.  ""I learnt it myself from one of the last surviving native speakers back in the 1950s.""  Recession in the mid 19th Century forced many Manx residents to leave the island to seek work in England. And there was a reluctance among parents to pass the language down through the generations, with many believing that to have Manx as a first language would stifle job opportunities overseas.  There was a decline in the language. By the early 1960s there were perhaps as few as 200 who were conversant in the tongue. The last native speaker, Ned Maddrell, died in 1974.  The decline was so dramatic that Unesco pronounced the language extinct in the 1990s.  But the grim prognosis coincided with a massive effort at revival. Spearheaded by activists like Stowell and driven by lottery funding and a sizeable contribution (currently £100,000 a year) from the Manx government, the last 20 years have had a huge impact.  Now there is even a Manx language primary school in which all subjects are taught in the language, with more than 60 bilingual pupils attending. Manx is taught in a less comprehensive way in other schools across the island.  In an island where 53% of the population were born abroad, it's perhaps surprising that there seems to be as much enthusiasm among British immigrants for Manx language as there is among native Manx people.  ""These days it's actually come-overs' like me [the local term for people who have come to the island from other parts of the British Isles] who have more interest in Manx than the locals,"" says Rik Clixby, a music blogger who moved to the island a decade ago from Middlesbrough in order to marry his university sweetheart.  ""It's never going to be at the point where you will hear a whole pub full of people talking in Manx,"" says Clixby. ""But it's becoming more high profile. I'm really interested in learning the language and it's good to see articles now being written in Manx in the local newspapers - not that I can understand more than a few words.  ""But it seems to be more of a passion among people who have come here from elsewhere. 'Come-overs' like me are looking for a cultural identity and, now they've found one here, are particularly attached to it.""  Donna Long, a lifelong resident of the island, has four sons who all attend the Manx-language school. She thinks that having her children learn Manx as well as English is a hugely positive experience for them.  ""Our friends think that it's a slightly eccentric decision to send all our boys there but they all really enjoy it,"" she says.  ""The best thing is that it will hopefully unlock their brain to learn other languages easily too. They were all completely bilingual in Manx and English by the age of six.  ""I don't think Manx will ever be useful outside of the island but I certainly think that in terms of getting jobs, if they do stay on the island - particularly in the public sector - then attending this little jewel of a school and being fluent in Manx can never be a disadvantage.""  Outside of the strenuous efforts being made in the education, there is also the inevitable app for grown-ups.  There have been 1,700 downloads, including 150 in America, says Adrian Cain, language development officer at the Manx Heritage Foundation. ""About 1,900 people at the moment claim to be able to speak Manx, though it's still hard to know the exact levels of fluency.""  But the investment in keeping Manx alive doesn't appeal to everyone, Stowell admits.  ""If you hear criticism of Manx, it's nearly always from elderly Manx people who still have the mentality of the mid-20th Century when the language was considered to be a totally backward thing to be heard speaking.""  Jim Watterson, an Isle of Man resident from Port Erin, is a vocal critic of the money being spent. ""Support in this area must be considered carefully and in perspective at a time when education is under such budgetary stress - libraries and pre-schools closing, teacher numbers being cut.  ""I would suggest that this level of funding for the teaching of an almost dead language is a luxury that cannot presently be afforded.""  But is this Manx language renaissance a prelude to a fully fledged reassertion of patriotism? Stowell doubts it very much.  ""I don't think it's a nationalistic thing at all really. We're a wealthy island and we actually aren't part of the United Kingdom anyway. It's not an aggressive bone of contention at all. The island just doesn't work that way.  ""Our Latin motto on the national coat of arms says 'Quocunque Jeceris Stabit', which means, 'whichever way you throw it, it will stand' - which says a lot about the stoicism and pragmatism of people here.""  On an island with such a large migrant population, albeit mostly British, there has been a heartening turn of events for those who want to preserve languages.  ""Nobody on the Isle of Man is much impressed or surprised by anything,"", says Stowell. ""But it's definitely a positive sign when you can speak our native language in a pub and not get in a brawl - that to me has to be a sign of progress.""

434,"The EU's top court has declared ""invalid"" an EU law requiring telecoms firms to store citizens' communications data for up to two years.  The EU Data Retention Directive was adopted in 2006. The European Court of Justice says it violates two basic rights - respect for private life and protection of personal data.  The EU-wide ruling was prompted by Austrian and Irish complaints.  The 28-nation EU is currently drafting a new data protection law.  The ECJ ruling says the 2006 directive allows storage of data on a person's identity, the time of that person's communication, the place from which the communication took place and the frequency of that person's communications.  ""By requiring the retention of those data and by allowing the competent national authorities to access those data, the directive interferes in a particularly serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data,"" the court in Luxembourg ruled.  The UK government says it is carefully considering the implications of the ruling, the BBC's Chris Morris reports.  Austrian and Irish courts had asked the ECJ to decide whether the directive complied with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The judges acknowledged that data retention was justified in the fight against serious crime and to safeguard public security. But they argued that the directive was disproportionate.  They also said use of the data without an individual's knowledge ""is likely to generate in the persons concerned a feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance"".  The directive does not provide sufficient safeguards against possible abuse of personal data, the judges said.  And there was insufficient clarity concerning the basis for holding data for a minimum of six months or the maximum of two years, they argued.  Responding to the ruling, a British government spokesman said the retention of communications data was absolutely fundamental to allowing law enforcement authorities to investigate crime and ensure national security.  ""We cannot be in a position where service providers are unable to retain this data,"" the spokesman said.  The European Commission says it too is assessing the ruling. It said there had to be a proper balance between security and fundamental rights."
435,"Hillfield is a Fransiscan friary overlooking the Blackmore Vale and run by the brothers of the Society of St. Francis, who have established a project which combines caring for the natural environment with a commitment to faith, peace and justice - and is open to all.  Rooted in the life and spirituality of St Francis of Assisi [a friar and the founder of the Order of Friars Minor, more commonly known as the Franciscans], the brothers are working to share the Gospel greeting of peace with the people they meet.  With global warming and the environment becoming an important issue for many people, the Hilfield Project aims to do what it's always done, but in a way that makes it more accessible to all - through conservation projects on the land, by growing organic food and by understanding sustainable living, via the work and courses offered at the friary.  As Brother Samuel explains though, this isn't be about giving people a guilt trip.  He says: ""There's so much talk about it [the environment] that some people are a bit off put by it. People are made to feel guilty about it and we want to do the opposite of that.  ""We want to help people to see that to live sustainably and to live peaceably with the environment is the most wonderful and joyful thing to do.  ""I think the way we live with the environment affects the way we live with each other. If we live aggressively and destructively with the environment, we are more likely to live aggressively and destructively with each other.""  The Hilfield Project is open to people from all backgrounds, but people thinking of staying at the friary must be sympathetic towards the brothers' Franciscan ethos, which is fundamentally Christian and centred on Jesus Christ.  Brother Samuel explains: ""At the heart of our life here is a life of prayer. We worship together in the chapel four times a day and many of the people who come here join in that with us, but it's not made a condition.  ""At the core of the community here is a group of vowed Franciscan brothers of the Anglican Society of St Francis. We also have people living with us in the long term and young volunteers who come and work here for up to a year.  ""We are always looking for day volunteers; people who'll just come and give a hand - digging in the garden, helping with the office work, doing a bit of cleaning or helping with welcoming people [to the friary].""  Originally from Switzerland, she came to Dorset when her relationship failed.  Having always had a strong Christian faith, Chantal explains that she hoped God would guide her to the next chapter in her life.  She says: ""I split with my ex-partner. It was very hard for me. I just had to go - we weren't married. So, I decided to leave everything behind and left overnight.  ""I always wanted to go to England, so I ended up in Weymouth with my car.  ""Praying in a church [in Weymouth] I opened a newspaper and read an article about the [Hilfield] project and I thought, 'that's it!'""  Although Chantal doesn't necessarily feel closer to God since becoming involved with the Hilfield Project, she does admit that she discusses her faith more.  She says: ""I am more open to tell everybody who wants to hear how I feel about it [my faith] and I didn't do that before, as it seemed to be a very private thing.  ""My friends in Switzerland often write me letters now and write about problems. They are more open now just knowing that I am living in a Franciscan friary. It seems to be a safe place to bring things up.""  He says: ""There are chances for me personally to come closer to God through the work on the land. That's where I feel very close to the Divine.  ""I can see the Divine in creation, especially through working with it - so with the animals and in the garden - and also through living alongside other people as a community.  ""I think you have to try to be open to the Divine within each person when you live together. It's a lot of hard work, because we're just normal people with all of our normal problems and difficulties.""  Richard also faces difficulties with his closest friends in his hometown in Dorset.  He says: ""[They] don't understand why I'm here from a spiritual point of view. I think they understand the joy that it gives me in terms of working closely with the environment and working closely in building relationships with other people, but what I find difficult is that they can't see why that is obviously a spiritual pursuit.  ""The more difficult they find it the greater value I think there is in us doing it, because it challenges their preconceptions.  It's the same with the brothers. When people say, 'why would you chose to live a life of poverty, chastity and obedience?' - I think the very fact they [other people] are forced to ask that question, endorses its relevance and the need for it in the modern world."""

""His legacy in Blackpool transcends just football as he became an inspirational figure in the local community.  ""The life-size statue was made by local artist Peter Hodgkinson and shows 'Morty' in typical pose - firing another spectacular goal.  ""The statue will be positioned outside Blackpool Football Club's North Stand - which, appropriately, is also known as the Mortensen Stand.""  Jean Mortensen commented: ""I am delighted that the moment has arrived.  ""People have been talking for years about something like this and now the town has delivered and I feel quite emotional.""  The statue was being unveiled at 1800 BST ahead of the Seasiders' Carling Cup game against Hull City."
437,"By BBC News Online's Ray Dunne It is 20 years since four MPs called a press conference in London to announce their plans to ""break the mould of British politics"". It was an ambitious pledge but within 10 years it would become clear that the Social Democratic Party (SDP) would achieve no such thing. However, the 'gang of four' - Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams - came close and at times it looked like they may succeed. The four left the Labour Party citing major differences over European and defence policies. The party had lost the 1979 general election and was taking a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot. The 'Limehouse declaration' unveiled at the London press conference outlined an alternative vision. Within two months, a party had been formed under the title SDP - the four having apparently toyed with the idea of calling themselves New Labour. In a recent interview, former leader David Owen now Lord Owen said: ""We looked at Radical, New Labour Party, Democratic Labour but we ended up with Social Democratic Party because that was part of the European continental tradition."" He said they had rejected the New Labour name because they wanted the breakaway party to have a wider appeal and attract disillusioned Conservatives as well as Labour members. For a time it did. The party joined forces with the Liberal Party to create the Liberal-SDP Alliance in autumn 1981. This electoral alliance was headed jointly by Liberal leader David Steel and SDP leader Roy Jenkins. By the middle of 1982 the Alliance could boast 30 MPs - nearly all defectors from the Labour benches. Only a single Conservative crossed over although the party did win a handful of by-elections. Early opinion polls suggested that the British electorate supported this bid to ""break the mould"". At one point, the Alliance had in the region of 50% support in the polls. However, by the time of the 1983 the poll ratings had fallen. The Alliance secured more than 25% of the vote - just two points behind Labour - and entered the new parliament with 23 MPs. By the time Margaret Thatcher next decided to go to the country support for the Alliance was still strong. The 1987 general election saw the Alliance this time under the leadership of the ""Two Davids"" - David Steel and David Owen - win 23% of the vote and 22 seats. Labour, with Neil Kinnock at the helm, won 31% of the vote and secured 229 seats. After six years of existance the SDP and the Alliance, it was beginning to look like the mould of British politics would not be broken. After the election, Liberal Party leader David Steel proposed an official merger or what he called at the time a ""democratic fusion"" with the SDP. While most of the SDP's membership voted in favour of the merger, its leader David Owen remained adamantly opposed. He continued to lead a rump with a pledge to fight the now new Social and Liberal Democrat Party (SLD). Initially, his move seemed to be well informed. One year after the merger, the SDP pushed the SLD into third place in the Richmond by-election. But by 1990, everything had gone wrong. The party came seventh out of eight candidates with just 155 votes in the Bootle by-election trailing even the Monster Raving Loony Party. Within days, David Owen had announced the end of the party that was supposed to break the mould of British politics. What went wrong? Many have suggested that personalities got in the way. But according to Lord Owen the problems were down to a reforming Labour Party. Speaking this week, he said: ""I think as the Labour Party started to reform it became inevitable that the SDP would not be able to survive as a separate party."" The former SDP leader recently caused controversy when he suggested that he was the original architect of the policies behind New Labour. Lord Owen, who stood down as an MP in the 1992 election, believes that the reformed Labour Party is one of the lasting legacies of the SDP. Others however would disagree. Some critics have suggested that all the party achieved was a split in the left's vote throughout the 1980s allowing the Tories to remain in power. But he believes that the ""pressure of having a party take away a very substantial proportion of its vote"" forced the Labour Party to modernise. Few in the ranks of New Labour agree. While the gang of four never actually managed to break the mould of British politics, their influence and that of the SDP can still be felt. All four remain in politics, with Jenkins, Williams, and Rodgers sitting in the House of Lords for the Liberal Democrats. Lord Owen is a cross-bencher and is these days concentrating on fighting off attempts to get Britain to sign up to the euro as head of the pressure group New Europe. Many former members of the party are now working in the backrooms for both the Tories and Labour. But most have remained in the Liberal Democrats - not least their leader, one time SDP MP Charles Kennedy."
438,"A former Sunday Mirror journalist has pleaded guilty to intercepting voicemail messages in 2001.  The paper's former investigations editor, Graham Johnson, is the first Mirror Group Newspapers journalist to admit to phone hacking.  Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Mr Johnson, who will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 27 November, voluntarily contacted police in 2013.  He worked at the Sunday Mirror between 1997 and 2005.  A spokesman for Trinity Mirror said the company would not be making a comment on Mr Johnson's conviction.  Mr Johnson came forward in March 2013 after hacking a phone to investigate whether a soap star was having an affair with a gangster in autumn 2001.  The court heard that he had been ""shown by a senior person in a supervisory capacity how to access voicemails"" and that he was not aware that it was a crime at the time.  He listened to between 10 and 13 messages a day for a period of up to seven days, the court was told.  He confessed to a ""short and intense"" period of hacking lasting three to seven days.  Granting unconditional bail, District Judge Quentin Purdy praised the 46-year-old for admitting his actions.  He said: ""Great credit comes your way for pleading guilty today and even more so for literally turning yourself in and voluntarily throwing yourself at the mercy of the system.  ""However it was a grave intrusion into other people's business, indeed the history of recent years has shown how serious this kind of intrusion can be.""  Mr Johnson previously worked at the now defunct News of the World from 1995 to 1997 and has had work published by others including the Guardian and BBC Panorama.  He has also written eight non-fiction books and two novels.  In September, Trinity Mirror admitted for the first time that some of its journalists were involved in phone hacking.  Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson, entertainer Shane Richie and actor Christopher Eccleston are among those to have received compensation from the newspaper group."
439,"The Ahmadi movement, which has its origins in British-controlled northern India in the late 19th Century, identifies itself as a Muslim movement and follows the teachings of the Koran. However, it is regarded by orthodox Muslims as heretical because it does not believe that Mohammed was the final prophet sent to guide mankind, as orthodox Muslims believe is laid out in the Koran. The building of mosques is a priority for Ahmadiyya communities The Ahmadiyya community takes its name from its founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was born in 1835 and was regarded by his followers as the messiah and a prophet. Ghulam Ahmad saw himself as a renewer of Islam and claimed to have been chosen by Allah. According to Oxford Islamic Studies Online, Ghulam Ahmad - who was born in the town of Qadian in Punjab - ""based his convictions on the belief that Muslim religion and society had deteriorated to the point where divinely inspired reforms were needed."" In the early part of the 20th Century, the Ahmadiyya movement split into two over questions of leadership. The original branch called the Ahmadis also took the name Qadiani after the birthplace Ghulam Ahmad. According to Oxford Islamic Studies Online, this group emphasised their founder's claim to prophethood. The second group known as the Lahore Party, regarded Ghulam as only a reformer. Both branches have their headquarters in the UK. The Ahmadis insist that he was not a ""law-giving"" prophet and his job was only to propagate the laws enunciated by Islam's Prophet Mohammad. But few among the Muslim mainstream are willing to accept this argument. In 1947, the community moved its religious headquarters from Qadian in India to Rabwah in Pakistan. Then in 1953, orthodox Muslim groups in Pakistan came together to form what they called the ""anti-Qadiani movement"". Described by rights organisations as one of the most relentlessly persecuted communities in Pakistan, the Ahmadiyya have seen their personal and political rights erode steadily over the years under pressure from orthodox Muslim groups. Throughout the first half of the 20th Century, the issue of their faith kept being raised before different courts at the district level. In 1974, under severe pressure from clerics, Pakistan's first elected prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, introduced a constitutional amendment - known as the second amendment - which declared Ahmadiyya non-Muslims. A decade later, a new law was brought in barring Ahmadis from calling their places of worship mosques or from propagating their faith in ""any way, directly or indirectly"". Anticipating the impact of the new law, the community moved its headquarters to the UK. According to Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jamaat, by Simon Valentine, the movement stresses non-violence and tolerance of other faiths. It is also zealous in its outlook and has a strong missionary programme. It has established itself in Britain, Europe, America, Africa, and other parts of Asia, with the building of mosques a high priority. In 1982, the Ahmadiyya mosque was the first mosque to be built in Spain since the Moors were expelled in 1492. While Ahmadis say they have 200 million followers, mainstream Islamic scholars say this is a massive exaggeration. They claim there are at best 10 million Ahmadis. Today, the Ahmadiyya community faces restrictions in many Muslim nations, saying followers are constantly persecuted. In 2008, in Indonesia, there was a spate of attacks against Ahmadiyya mosques by extremists, and moves by the government to restrict the sect.     "
440,"The Houses of Parliament could have to be ""abandoned"" within 20 years without extensive repair work, Commons Speaker John Bercow has said.  The Grade I-listed building suffers from flooding, contains a great deal of asbestos and has fire safety issues.  In a speech in Westminster, Mr Bercow said a £3bn repair bill was a ""realistic scenario"".  If MPs and peers were to temporarily move out, locations outside London should be considered, he added.  The Palace of Westminster - containing the House of Commons and House of Lords - is a Grade I-listed building much of which dates back to the 1840s and 1850s.  Much of it has never been renovated, and the heating, water, draining and electrical systems are described as ""extremely antiquated"".  A study in 2012 concluded ""irreversible damage"" would be done without extensive renovation work. Among the options put forward to carry out the work was a temporary closure, with MPs and peers meeting in an alternative venue.  Speaking at an event organised by the Hansard Society, Mr Bercow said the ""fabulous institution"" must not ""have the ethos of a museum"".  ""It will require bold and imaginative managerial leadership to ensure that we are a Parliament fit for purpose and that this Victorian legacy can be rendered practical for contemporary representation,"" he said.  Mr Bercow said it would be a ""huge pity"" if by the 200th anniversary of the fire that destroyed the old Palace of Westminster in 1834, ""we had to abandon this site and look elsewhere in order to serve the public interest properly"".  He added: ""Yet I will tell you in all candour that unless management of the very highest quality and a not inconsequential sum of public money are deployed on this estate over the next 10 years that will be the outcome.""  Taking questions afterwards, Mr Bercow said he was ""very uneasy"" about ""decanting"" Parliament to another building while repairs are carried out since ""once you are out it can be very difficult to get back"".  But he added: ""If we were to decant, should we consider all options including, almost certainly, a regional option? We should.""  Any decisions would have to be made by the whole House of Commons, Mr Bercow said, while the sums of money involved would require government funding.  Lib Dem MP John Thurso, chair of the House of Commons Commission, said the Palace of Westminster was ""really in a dire condition"" and it was a ""distinct possibility"" that MPs and peers would have to move out while it was refurbished.  ""There are very serious problems throughout the Palace,"" he told Radio 4's World at One programme.  ""Simply patching it up to the minimal cost each year is no longer a viable option.""  While no-one yet knew what the work would cost, he said he believed there would be ""an outcry"" if such an iconic building was demolished or left to go to seed.  The present building has had no general renovation since repairs of wartime damage were carried out between 1945 and 1950."
441,"Same-sex couples will be able to get married in England and Wales after new measures became law.  The government's controversial legislation on the issue received Royal Assent on Wednesday.  The Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat leaderships all backed the proposals, which were finally approved by MPs and peers earlier this week.  It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year.  Under the terms of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, religious organisations will have to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so.  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced the bill had received Royal Assent - the formal approval of the sovereign required for all legislation. The news was greeted with cheers in the Commons chamber.  MPs decided not to oppose a number of minor changes agreed by the House of Lords and approved the legislation on Tuesday.  There will also be a review of whether groups such as the humanists will be allowed to carry out marriages, while ministers said they were prepared to look at eliminating any difference in the treatment of gay couples when it came to pension schemes.  During the Commons debate, Equalities Minister Maria Miller said the passing of the bill was ""clear affirmation"" that ""respect for each and every person is paramount, regardless of age, religion, gender, ethnicity or sexuality"", she added.  But Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, one of the bill's opponents, said it was ""astonishing that a bill for which there is absolutely no mandate, against which a majority of Conservatives voted, has been bulldozed through both Houses"".  He added: ""I think the government should think very carefully in future if they want the support of these benches. Offending large swathes of the Conservative Party is not a good way of going about it.""  But Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said: ""It's wonderful to see same-sex marriage achieve legal recognition. Quakers see the light of God in everyone so we respect the inherent worth of each individual and each loving relationship."""
442,"There must have been something in the water, or some favourable conjunction of stars that shone down on Kansas City, Missouri in the 1920s. How else can one account for the pre-eminence of Kansas City men in the field of the animated cartoon? There had been, and would continue to be, important figures from elsewhere, but Kansas City trumped the rest of the United States when it came to talent. Consider this roster:  And there was Ubbe Eert Iwwerks (1901-1971), Walt Disney's right-hand man, who would lead the spearhead of the Disney empire - sometimes from out front, sometimes behind the scenes. It was Ub Iwerks , who helped create Mickey Mouse, whose ingenious skills helped make Disneyland and Walt Disney World a reality. But Ub had his own cartoon studio for a while, a fact that is often forgotten.  Ub was there at the start, when Walt Disney went into business for himself, as the Laugh-O-Gram Company in 1922. Their first animated films were crude, and profits were usually nonexistent, but surrender was not in Walt's vocabulary. They hit their stride with the Alice's Wonderland series (also known as Alice in Cartoonland), which combined cartoon characters with live-action film of a little girl, the titular Alice. The novelty, and free-form storytelling typical of the period, caught on. Walt moved the company to California, and the others followed one by one.  In 1927, after the Alice series began to wind down, Walt and Ub created a new character - Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Oswald had more personality than the cartoon characters in the Alice comedies - sort of a first step towards Mickey Mouse. That step was rushed, when Charles Mintz, who distributed the Oswald cartoons, took the character away from Disney and gave the rabbit to another company. What to do? Ub came up with a cartoon mouse, which Walt named Mortimer; Walt's wife dissented, and suggested Mickey instead. A star was born.  Times were still tough, and talented staff in short supply. Ub sometimes animated entire cartoons (roughly seven minutes of animation) by himself - thousands of drawings per cartoon.  Steamboat Willie (1928), the first Mickey Mouse cartoon with sound, was largely Ub's work. When Disney inaugurated a second cartoon series, the Silly Symphonies, Ub was again hard at work. And The Skeleton Dance (1929), one of the most famous Silly Symphonies, was entirely animated by Ub Iwerks.  But all work and no play, as the saying goes, makes Ub overworked. Disney's increasing demands for more and better work wore on Ub's nerves. When Pat Powers, an independent distributor of films, approached Ub with the chance to run his own animation studio, Ub took the chance. In 1929, with Mickey and the Silly Symphonies already dominant in the field, Ub walked away to try it on his own.  As impressive as the group that came out of Kansas City was, Ub recruited an equally outstanding crew to work at his studio. At its peak, the Iwerks studio employed people such as:  And there was a kid washing cels (the celluloid sheets on which the animation drawings were inked) named Charles 'Chuck' Jones, who would Join Friz Freleng and Carl Stalling and Frank Tashlin at Warner's. Just these people alone would be enough for a great animation studio.  Flip (37 cartoons) is a standard cartoon character in the early 1930s mode: he hops around cheerfully, gets into all sorts of scrapes, and has very little personality. Ub and his staff tried to make Flip into a star. They revised Flip's appearance several times, to make him cuter. They were not averse to putting Flip into surprisingly mature situations: two Flip cartoons, 'The Office Boy' and 'Room Runners' contain surprising amounts of sexual humour and near-nudity. Characters in Flip the Frog cartoons were not above saying 'Damn' now and then - something that startles American audiences even today. These things did draw the public's attention, but not favourably. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which distributed the Flip shorts, watched the profits decline.  The quality of the animation varied as Ub hired more people to work with him. Perhaps the best Flip cartoon is 'Spooks' in which Flip takes shelter from a storm in a haunted house. The animation is smooth and accomplished, the gags well paced.  Willie Whopper (13 cartoons) told 'whoppers', that is, tall stories, exaggerated accounts of his life and adventures. Like Flip, Willie's appearance was altered after the first few cartoons, in this case making him chubbier and more likeable. Willie's voice was performed by child actress Jane Withers, who had a long career in radio and movies. For all that audiences considered Willie an improvement over Flip , he was less successful, and ended the Iwerks association with MGM. Metro hired Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising away from Warner Brothers and set them up instead.  Ub created this series (24 cartoons) as his own version of the Silly Symphony; one-shot (meaning no continuing characters were used) shorts, often adaptations of old classics such as The Headless Horseman or Jack and the Beanstalk. The quality of the work improved as time went on, but no major studio chose to distribute them. The last ComiColor cartoon, Happy Days was adapted from Gene Byrnes's comic strip, Reg'lar Fellars, and is a sad sign that the Iwerks studio was finally hitting its stride just as their money ran out. Finally the studio had to suspend production, leaving a ComiColor version of Oliver Twist half-drawn.  After drastically cutting the staff, Ub began to produce cartoons for other studios. His two cartoons for Warner Brothers, Porky and Gabby and Porky's Super Service were made with the help of two Warner animators, Bob Clampett and Iwerks alum Chuck Jones. They are undistinguished Porky cartoons, notable only in that they spend a lot of time with Gabby Goat, a character created for these two shorts.  Gran Pop Monkey (three cartoons) was a character created and designed by the English illustrator and cartoonist Lawson Wood. It is not certain whether these cartoons were ever released.  Charles Mintz was producing cartoons at Columbia Pictures and hired Ub to help produce one-shot cartoons (13 all told) along the lines of the ComiColor shorts. Like most of Columbia's cartoon output, these aren't the best cartoons around, but they are pleasant and colourful.  A colour film is made from a negative which is in turn made from several other negatives. Red, blue and green are used, one to a negative, to produce the full range of colours. The first three-colour process was Technicolor, developed in the late 1920s. Before that, two-colour processes were used, which reproduced some colours well, others badly.  Disney had an exclusive contract to use three-colour Technicolor on his cartoons, so Ub Iwerks had to settle for lesser formulas. The only Flip the Frog cartoon in colour is the very first, 'Fiddlesticks', which utilizes an earlier Technicolor two-colour process. The two-colour Technicolor used red and a green-blue, and worked well enough.  Two Willie Whopper cartoons, 'Davy Jones Locker' and 'Hell's Fire' were produced in colour, using the two-colour (red and blue) Cinecolor process. The ComiColor cartoons also used Cinecolor. The Porky Pig cartoons were both in black and white. By the time the Iwerks studio began producing Color Rhapsodies for Charles Mintz, Disney had lost the exclusive with three-colour Technicolor, so that the Color Rhapsodies are the only Iwerks cartoons in a three colour process.  Why aren't the Iwerks cartoons more famous? The reasons are all too clear. Flip the Frog was not especially popular; neither was Willie Whopper. The Comicolor cartoons were independently distributed, so that no corporate giant owns them today; they fell through the cracks. Many talented people worked at Iwerks, but most of them were still learning the trade. Had they been able to continue working, and produce the sort of work that was appearing in, say, the mid-1940s, Iwerks cartoons would be treasured by more than a few.  The problem was not solely with Ub's staff; it was pervasive throughout the cartoon industry. The 1930s was a time of growth and development in the art of the animated cartoon. Watch a random sampling of cartoons from the 1930s and an equal number from a decade later and the differences are clear; the stories are sharper, the gags timed more effectively, the use of character animation and music has advanced exponentially. The Iwerks studio had the seeds of greatness but, in those days of the Great Depression, seeds had to be strong in order to survive.  After his studio closed for good in 1940, Ub did what was for many unthinkable. Walt Disney was known to hold a grudge against people who left him, but somehow this did not apply to Ub. Perhaps they were never as close as they once had been, but Walt and Ub worked together again until Walt's death in 1966. Ub rarely worked as closely in the animation department as he had before, instead working as an inventor and researcher to help develop new technologies. The blending of live-action and animation in Mary Poppins (1964) benefited from Ub's research, while calling to mind memories of the Alice cartoons. Ub worked outside of Disney as well, winning an Academy Award as part of the special effects team on Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963).  Ub Iwerks was respected by all who knew him. During divisive labour troubles at Disney in the 1940s, the picketers would move aside to let Ub come to work; they would not delay or heckle him. Grim Natwick compared him favourably to Christ, though that might have been a slight exaggeration. What better tribute can there be than to have worked hard all your life, and earned the respect of your friends and colleagues?"
443,"The remains of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have been exhumed to investigate allegations he was murdered. The bodies of many well-known people have been dug up in the course of history, for myriad reasons. Here is a selection.  The English soldier and statesman died in 1658, was embalmed, had a state funeral and was then buried in Westminster Abbey. After the Restoration, he and two others were exhumed and beheaded. His corpse is believed to have been thrown into a pit at the execution site, which is near modern-day Marble Arch in London. His head was stuck on a pole and displayed on the roof of Westminster Hall. During the 18th Century it was regarded as a collector's item. The head was analysed in 1815 and confirmed to be that of Cromwell.  Rumours abounded that the notorious American gangster had faked his own death in 1882, so the body presumed to be his was exhumed in 1995 for DNA testing. The tests indicated that it was indeed his corpse, as the DNA was consistent with that of his known descendants. But a further two bodies were later exhumed - including that of a man who had claimed in life to be the real Jesse James.  Ethiopia's last emperor was exhumed after being discovered buried under a toilet in Addis Ababa's Imperial Palace, in 1992. Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia for 45 years and was regarded as a living god by Rastafarians. He was overthrown in a coup led by the dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1974, and held captive for a year in the palace before he died. It is thought he may have been murdered by his captors. In 2000, more than 25 years after his death, he was reburied in Addis Ababa's Trinity Cathedral.  The wife of Argentine President Juan Peron was embalmed - but after a military coup in the mid-1950s the country's new rulers wanted the body out of the way. Removed by dead of night from a trade union headquarters in Buenos Aires, it probably spent time in a van parked on the streets of the city, behind a cinema screen, and inside the city's waterworks, as well as in the offices of Military Intelligence. In 1957, with covert help from the Vatican, she was buried in Milan, Italy, under a false name. Graffiti began to appear in Buenos Aires asking ""Where is the body of Evita Peron?"" In 1971 the body was disinterred and driven to Juan Peron's new home in Madrid. Two years later, he was again elected President of Argentina, but died soon after. His third wife, Isabel, oversaw the repatriation of Evita's body to Argentina. She now lies in her family's mausoleum, in a crypt fortified like a nuclear bunker.  The comedian's body was dug up in March 1978 by two men who reburied it in a cornfield, and began demanding a ransom from Chaplin's lawyer. Taken from the village cemetery in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, where the comic actor had spent the last 25 years of his life, it was returned to the same grave three months later, following the arrest of the grave robbers - refugees from Poland and Bulgaria. This time, however, the vault was made of reinforced concrete. The village gravedigger who discovered the theft said there was no chance of the body again being spirited away at night. ""You would need a pneumatic drill to open that vault,"" he said. ""And that is bound to make a lot of noise.""  When the wife of English artist and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti died from an opiate overdose in 1862, Rossetti buried a book of his poetry alongside her. Years later, and with his eyesight failing, making it harder to paint, he decided to retrieve the poems. For this, he needed permission from the Home Secretary, as grave-robberies were a big problem at the time. This was granted, though Rossetti wanted the operation to be kept as secret as possible. The grave slab at Highgate Cemetery in London was removed, the coffin prised open, and the manuscript removed and disinfected. He was said to be disappointed that the poem he had most wanted had a ""great worm-hole through every page"" - though a significant volume of poems from the exhumation did appear.  The ashes of Marie Curie and her husband Pierre were moved in 1995 from a small cemetery to the Pantheon in Paris. This was done in order to honour her life and work. The Polish-born scientist won two Nobel prizes and did ground-breaking work on radiation. She died from leukaemia in 1934 (caused by exposure to radiation).  Christopher Columbus asked in his will to be buried in America, but no suitable church existed there at his death in 1506, so he was buried initially in the Spanish city of Valladolid, then moved to a monastery in Seville. In 1542, however, the body was removed and sent to Hispaniola, where it was buried in Santo Domingo (now the capital of the Dominican Republic). At the end of the 17th Century, Spain ceded the western part of Hispaniola to France, so Columbus's body was taken to Cuba. Then, when Cuba became independent, in 1898, the body crossed the Atlantic for a final time and was buried in the Cathedral of Seville. At least, that is the established theory. There is, however, a box containing bones, inscribed with the name ""Christopher Columbus"" at a Columbus monument in the Dominican capital... Researchers who took DNA samples from the Seville body say it matches the DNA of Columbus's brother Diego, also buried near Seville. The remains in Santo Domingo have never been released for testing.  Virginia Clemm married her first cousin, American author Edgar Allan Poe, at the age of 13, and died of tuberculosis at 24, in 1847. She was originally buried in the vault of the family from whom the Poes rented their cottage in Fordham, near New York. In 1875 the cemetery was destroyed, and a few years later one of Poe's biographers, William Gill, took possession of her bones - apparently, just at the point the sexton was about to throw them away. For a while, Gill stored the bones in a box under his bed. Five years later they were buried with her husband's in a tomb built for the author in 1875 in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground (now part of the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore) as a replacement for his original simple grave in the same burial ground.  The Argentine-born Cuban revolutionary leader was captured and shot in Bolivia in 1967. For years the exact location of his body was kept secret, then in 1995 it was revealed by a Bolivian general involved in the operation that he had been buried by an airport runway, near the site where he was killed. Two years later, his body was exhumed and returned to Cuba in time for the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of his death. It now lies in a mausoleum and museum to Guevara, which is open to visitors. Some questions have been raised, however, as to whether the correct body was exhumed in 1997.

444,"Julian Barratt is chiefly known as one half of surreal comedy duo The Mighty Boosh (alongside Noel Fielding), which first exploded onto the Edinburgh Fringe in the 1998 Edinburgh Festival and has since become a huge cult hit on radio and TV.  Barratt's first notable television appearance came alongside Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson in black comedy Asylum (for the Paramount Comedy Channel), but the idea for the Boosh came to him and Fielding while they participated in Stewart Lee's Edinburgh Show King Dong v Moby Dick, playing a giant penis and a giant whale.  After together winning a 1998 Perrier Best Newcomer Award, the pair earned a BBC London radio series (produced by Danny Wallace) that quickly transferred to Radio 4.  Eventually a TV version of the Boosh appeared on BBC Three, where its unique brand of surrealism has won a devoted and still-growing fan-base.  Barratt has mixed up his work with other roles, including a scene-stealing turn in British film Lucky Break and most notably, co-starring in media satire Nathan Barley as the frustrated writer Dan Ashcroft.  Shy and self-deprecating in interviews, Barratt can come across as a reluctant star but he's become a highly sought-after performer.  As of 2007 he and Fielding are preparing to unleash a third TV series of the Boosh."
445,"Deep in the jungle of the Central African Republic, about 2,000 Ugandan troops are spearheading the campaign to catch Joseph Kony.  Hacking through the jungle with machetes, they lead us to a camp abandoned just two weeks earlier by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), the rebel group commanded by Kony, who claims to be fighting to install a government in Uganda based on the Biblical 10 Commandments.  A rebel defector led the Ugandan army to the camp, which would have housed between 50-60 fighters, including women and children.  Among the children was a five-year-old boy, said to be Kony's son, and his mother Doreen Abango. She was abducted by the LRA aged 13, and had managed to escape only 10 days earlier.  ""I started walking at night with my child… I did not leave any tracks that could be used to follow me, because I knew if I was found I would be killed,"" she said.  Few in northern Uganda escaped unscathed from Kony's war, including his own family.  His older sister Gabriela Lakot still lives in Odek, northern Uganda, where Kony was born.  ""As soon as Kony was born he stood on his own two feet,"" she says. ""Everyone was astonished and wondrous saying: 'This child is strange.'  ""God has brought a curse on this family - that was my mother's lament. Kony brought so much trouble on us up to now. Everyone hates us.""  Gabriela also blames her brother for the death of her son.  ""My first born was shot by the Ugandan army when he was with Kony. All that is his fault,"" she said.  Kony's rebels have terrorised swathes of South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic over the years.  It is estimated by the Ugandan army that there are only 450 members of the LRA left.  Caesar Achellam, a senior LRA commander, was captured in May this year. He says Kony will never surrender because of indictments in the International Criminal Court (ICC).  ""Kony is afraid, he is really afraid. He is afraid of the accusations against him in The Hague,"" he said.  Kony is wanted by the ICC for war crimes including rape, the murder of civilians and forcibly recruiting children to serve in his Lord's Resistance Army.  Kony's global notoriety increased earlier this year because of the internet video Kony 2012, which has been watched tens of millions of times since it was posted online by the US advocacy group Invisible Children.  The Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is clear that more foreign support is needed to bring Kony to justice.  He said: ""We are now an international mission. It is not a domestic mission and we cannot be an international mission on domestic resources. It is up to the international community to help.""  An African Union force of 5,000 troops from the four countries most affected by the LRA was due to begin operations in March, but it has not happened yet.  Ugandan minister Betty Bigombe is one of many African leaders who have tried and failed to talk Kony into making peace.  According to Ms Bigombe, Kony himself predicted how the war would end: ""He would tell me, I know exactly how I am going to die. I am going to die like Hitler.  ""One day people will wake up and find that I have been dead for some time.""

446,"A US judge has dismissed a legal action accusing Harry Potter author JK Rowling of copying the work of another author.  The estate of late author Adrian Jacobs claimed that the plot of fourth Harry Potter outing Goblet of Fire plagiarised parts of his book The Adventures of Willy the Wizard.  Judge Shira Sheindlin wrote in her ruling that there were major differences between the two works.  She added they were ""distinctly different in both substance and style"".  ""The contrast between the total concept and feel of the works is so stark that any serious comparison of the two strains credulity,"" Judge Sheindlin said in the 49-page ruling.  Scholastic, the US publisher for the Harry Potter books, said it was satisfied with the decision.  ""The court's swift dismissal supports our position that the case was completely without merit and that comparing Willy the Wizard to the Harry Potter series was absurd,"" spokesman Kyle Good said.  ""Scholastic will continue to vigorously defend any such frivolous claims challenging the originality of Harry Potter.""  The estate of British author Jacobs, who died in 1997, had claimed Rowling copied the plots of his 1987 book including a wizard contest, and the idea of wizards travelling on trains.  When the estate filed a similar legal action against British publisher Bloomsbury last February, Rowling said that she had never heard of Mr Jacobs's book before the original copyright claim was made in 2004.  In October, the judge overseeing that case at London's High Court said that the claims were ""improbable,"" but he turned down an application by lawyers for Rowling and Bloomsbury for an immediate dismissal of the case.  The first Harry Potter Book was published in 1997 and the series has sold more than 400 million copies worldwide."
447,"But the discovery of the body of an English climber, George Mallory, who disappeared in 1924 while trying to conquer the summit with fellow Briton Andrew Irvine, is set to reopen the question.  Did they or didn't they?  Mallory and Irvine were last seen on the North Side - apparently within 2,000ft of the world's highest peak. But they never returned.  It is not clear whether Mallory and Irvine died on their way up or down from the summit.  The search is now on for Mallory's Kodak camera - which he kept in his knapsack - which could prove whether the pair reached ""the top of the world"".  The progress of the eight climbers who found the body has been relayed back to their site on the Internet, mountainzone.com.  ""I want to convey how much, for us, this discovery is a huge achievement and so far beyond our wildest dreams,"" he writes.  ""It is hard to convey our excitement over this discovery.""  The body was found about 2,000ft (615m) from the windblown 29,028-ft (8,848m) summit, not far from that of a Chinese climber whose accounts were used by the Nova crew to try to locate Mallory and Irvine.  However, a camera or any other evidence, which could prove they reached the summit 29 years before Sir Edmund and Sherpa Tenzing, has yet to be found.  ""When we realised that it was George Mallory, we were really blown away,"" said Mr Hahn.  ""We didn't want to disturb him, he'd been lying there for 75 years, but at the same time we thought what better tribute to the man than to try and find out if he had summitted Mount Everest in 1924.""  They buried the body, according to the family's wishes, on Everest.  Hongbao described the body as ""English Dead,"" and indicated its vintage clothing broke to pieces when he touched it.  The body was found on a snow terrace, just below the spot where an ice axe believed to be Irvine's was found in 1933.  The axe had three notches on the handle, which was how Irvine marked his equipment.  Two days after Hongbao told his story in 1975, he died in an avalanche on Everest's North Face."
448,"The park organised its displays despite waiting for the outcome of an ongoing noise abatement case.  On Friday, a judge ruled the displays could continue and has placed an overall noise limit of 40 decibels on the park.  A spokeswoman said the limit was more than the original noise abatement order had allowed.  The Staffordshire park had been ordered to come up with ways of reducing noise, after losing an appeal against an abatement order brought by residents.  In an earlier ruling, the park was limited to one 30-minute firework display a year.  Traditionally the park held five events at the end of October.  This year it is planning three for 28, 29 and 30 October."
449,"There are several Hindu points of view on euthanasia.  Most Hindus would say that a doctor should not accept a patient's request for euthanasia since this will cause the soul and body to be separated at an unnatural time. The result will damage the karma of both doctor and patient.  Other Hindus believe that euthanasia cannot be allowed because it breaches the teaching of ahimsa (doing no harm).  However, some Hindus say that by helping to end a painful life a person is performing a good deed and so fulfilling their moral obligations.  Hinduism is less interested than western philosophers in abstract ideas of right or wrong. Rather it focuses on the consequences of our actions.  For Hindus, culture and faith are inextricable. So although many moral decisions taken by Hindus seem more influenced by their particular culture than by the ideas of their faith, this distinction may not be as clear as it seems.  Karma: Hindus believe in the reincarnation of the soul (or atman) through many lives - not necessarily all human. The ultimate aim of life is to achieve moksha, liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth.  A soul's next life is decided by karma, as the consequence of its own good or bad actions in previous lives. You could regard a soul's karma as somehow representing the net worth of its good and bad actions.  Non-violence: Another important principle is ahimsa, not being violent or causing harm to other beings.  Dharma: Hindus live their lives according to their dharma - their moral duties and responsibilities.  The dharma requires a Hindu to take care of the older members of their community.  Killing (euthanasia, murder, suicide) interferes with the killed soul's progress towards liberation. It also brings bad karma to the killer, because of the violation of the principle of non-violence.  When the soul is reincarnated in another physical body it will suffer as it did before because the same karma is still present.  Death: The doctrine of karma means that a Hindu tries to get their life in a good state before they die, making sure that there is no unfinished business, or unhappinesses. They try to enter the state of a sannyasin - one who has renounced everything.  The ideal death is a conscious death, and this means that palliative treatments will be a problem if they reduce mental alertness.  The state of mind that leads a person to choose euthanasia may affect the process of reincarnation, since one's final thoughts are relevant to the process.  There are two Hindu views on euthanasia:  Prayopavesa, or fasting to death, is an acceptable way for a Hindu to end their life in certain circumstances.  Prayopavesa is very different from what most people mean by suicide:  Prayopavesa is only for people who are fulfilled, who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life. It is really only suitable for elderly ascetics.  Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, a Hindu leader born in California, took his own life by prayopavesa in November 2001.  After finding that he had untreatable intestinal cancer the Satguru meditated for several days and then announced that he would accept pain-killing treatment only and would undertake prayopavesa - taking water, but no food.  He died on the 32nd day of his self-imposed fast."
450,"You are in:          ""The audience of telenovelas are of all social classes, but are mostly of course, the poor people.      The best actors, best actresses and best musicians of Brazil - the best of the best are on TV - doing telenovelas.""          ""In South America we love melodrama.       We need melodrama to survive. I think it’s our language. We have 40 million people watching it every day.       We are melodramatic in our music, poetry and soaps. You can find the same sensation in Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Chile.""       ...I think Charles Dickens and Honore de Balzac are the fathers of the Brazilian Telenovela.""         Brazil's dramatic soap operas, Telenovelas, as these fiction series are called, started nearly forty years ago. The first one, 25499 Busy (about a telephonist), ran every day from July to September 1963.       The telenovelas not only grip the nation but are sold to 120 countries around the world. They are made in Projac, Globo TV's huge production village twenty miles south of Rio de Janeiro.       One of the most popular telenovelas in 2000 is Terra Nostra the story of an Italian family that has recently emigrated to Brazil. The family saga is played out against a background of the creation of a Brazilian nation state. The theme tune runs ""Our land, land of our dreams; hope your name is Brazil."" Terra Nostra helps sustain a myth of the birth of Brazil. ""It’s about roots,and the great influence of Italians in our country, at the end of the last century. Many people recognise their families in the story. 'Oh, my grandfather came in a ship like this.' That’s the success of the story."" ""About thirty years ago, Brazil was a lot of countries. It was South Brazil, North Brazil, and North East Brazil. I think TV has unified it. We are now one country. We used to be many different countries. We speak the same language. We know we are a country now.       The celebrity is boring, ok, but I know I am also responsible for its unification. I helped make this country a country."" Jose Wilker, actor and star of Roque Santeiro, an outstanding Telenovela broadcast in the 1980s.    ""The novela is a long, drawn out production. They used to be one hundred episodes long. Nowadays, there are two hundred. Structuring a long piece of work that runs 7-8 months is difficult.       The first 20 episodes grab the audience. That’s where the drama starts and the problems are all presented. The great enemy of the telenovela is when things stop happening and that tends to be around the 50th episode.       This is when you arrive to what we, the critics, call the belly of the series, the drop-off in the story. Everything sags. This has to happen. All the problems have to be saved up to be resolved for the end. So they create sub-plots i.e. more difficulties for the characters.       The really big problems are saved up for the end, which could be who is the son or father of whom or who killed who. These big questions are saved up for the end of the series.          ""We talk about us. About our reality. Poor people. Rich. Our aspirations. Dreams. Love. Passion. Mostly hope... The telenovelas say, it’s possible to come from extreme poverty and become rich, but not often - we are good pupils of American cinema.""         ""Before in telenovelas, black characters only appeared as cooks, or chauffeurs, or in the novelas set in the olden days, they appeared as slaves. Lately, they have been trying to show black characters with the same status as white ones, with liberal professions, as characters who work in business. There’s also a political significance here. I don’t just mean in the administration of politics, but I mean social politics""     "
451,"Abbey National has joined the competition in the online banking market with the launch of its internet bank, Cahoot.  However, on a day marked by technical problems on the internet, hundreds of customers were prevented from opening accounts with the new bank.  Cahoot managing director Tim Murley said the website had crashed in the morning, after taking several 100 applications.  He said the situation had improved later in the day, but the problems had still not been resolved.  ""It's not gone as well as we had hoped,"" he said, adding that they had yet to uncover what had gone wrong.  He said Cahoot had had considerable interest, with applications peaking at about 1,000, but many people had not been able to get through.  The flotation of rival internet bank, Egg, was also marred by technical problems which prevented private investors from selling their shares in the crucial first hour of trade, although the problem was later cleared up.  To lure customers in an increasingly competitive market, Cahoot is offering credit cards and overdrafts interest-free for a year to its first 25,000 customers.  Over the longer term, the bank will offer credit cards and overdraft interest rates of between 7% and 11%.  The bank also plans to introduce other products, such as share dealing, savings and personal loans.  ""We don't make much money on the zero per cent [interest rates], but it is really about establishing yourself,"" said Tim Sawyer, Abbey National's marketing director.  ""We're expecting a good response, not a deluge,"" he said.  Cahoot, with only 56 staff, wants to attract customers by being the lowest-cost players in the market and plans to target the individual needs of customers.  ""We're going very much on individualised pricing offering rates based on credit history,"" Mr Sawyer said.  The bank aims to have 100,000 customers and 150,000 accounts by the end of this year.  By 2003, it hopes to have 5% of the online banking market, with 300,000 customers and 630,000 accounts.  Abbey National joins a slew of financial institutions which are launching online banks.  Egg, the online bank of UK life insurance and pensions group Prudential, starts trading on the stock exchange on Monday.  Halifax plans to launch Intelligent Finance in July and Lloyd's TSB's evolvebank.com will kick off toward the end of the year.  All the banks are offering low costs for customers and competitive rates through new technology, such as mobile phones with internet access.  Analysts say that banks are unlikely to make great profits from online banking, but say the competition among banks to cut costs will be passed onto the consumer."
452,"World at Your Feet, which is released on 5 June, received its first radio play on BBC Radio 1.  Singer Danny McNamara said he was inspired by the nation's love of football when the team does well.  The song features the lyrics ""there's no-one you can't beat"" and ""you know it's going to be our time"" but does not mention the word ""football"".  He said: ""There's 'You lift it up with one proud kiss', which is obviously about lifting the cup.  ""Then there's 'You're the first in my life to think we might just go all the way'.  ""I wasn't born in 1966 but I think they have got every chance.""  McNamara said the band had been ""very, very nervous"" about unveiling their effort.  He said they would play it to the England players for the first time on Sunday.  ""They haven't heard it yet, but we are playing the PFA awards so we'll get a chance to play it to them then,"" he said.  ""We hope they like it. We did it wholeheartedly so we hope they like it.""  The band are yet to record a video to accompany the song but hope the likes of David Beckham and Wayne Rooney will join them if they perform on Top of the Pops.  McNamara said he was not intimidated by comparisons to previous favourites like Three Lions and New Order's World in Motion.  He said: ""New Order are one of my favourite bands. Joy Division, the band before New Order, were one of the reasons I got into forming a band.  ""There's been some classic songs and you can't really be compared to them yet because people haven't had a chance to listen to it.  ""Those songs become classics when people take them into their hearts and I just hope people do (with ours).""  The band will give the first televised performance of the song on Match of the Day 2 on BBC Two on Sunday.  Virgin Radio's Christian O'Connell is releasing an unofficial song called the People's Anthem, featuring former footballer John Barnes, while singer Joe Fagin has re-recorded his 1984 hit That's Livin' Alright."
453,"India held their nerve on a tense final day in Chennai to win the decisive Test against Australia by two wickets and clinch a remarkable series victory.  On another dramatic day Australia hauled themselves back into contention as India, chasing a modest target of 155, slipped to 135 for seven, but the home side hung on to claim a memorable success.  It completed an outstanding recovery by India after they were beaten by ten wickets in the first Test. They won the second after following on and fought back to take this Test too.  It is Australia's first series defeat since they were beaten in Sri Lanka in 1999.  They began an absorbing day by dismissing Australia for 264 in their second innings. Harbhajan Singh finished with career best figures of eight for 84 and 15 in the match, India's second best return in Test history to set up the victory. India set out positively in pursuit of their target despite the loss of an early wicket. Glenn McGrath gave Australia the sought after early breakthrough when Siv Sundar Das top edged an attempted pull back to the bowler. India continued to score briskly as Sadagopan Ramesh and Vangipurappu Laxman appeared to be hurrying them home with a 58 run partnership. But with the score on 76, the pair hesitated over a single and Ricky Ponting swooped from cover to run out Ramesh for 25. Tendulkar and the prolific Laxman took the score to 101, with Tendulkar hitting Shane Warne out of the attack, before Jason Gillespie began an admirable spell of fast bowling that edged Australia back into contention. Tendulkar (17) was undone by a short ball and caught by Mark Waugh at second slip. Sourav Ganguly did not look comfortable against Gillespie. He edged one boundary before the next ball again found his edge for Mark Waugh to claim another catch. Rahul Dravid did not last long either before he fell to the off spin of Colin Miller, driving straight to Steve Waugh at extra cover. That left India 122 for five - 33 short of victory - in an increasingly tense contest. Nevertheless Laxman continued to bat freely and by tea India were ten runs closer. But immediately after the interval Australia bounced back as Miller took two wickets in four balls, including the key one of Laxman for 66.  India's leading scorer in the series pulled a short ball to mid-wicket where Mark Waugh took a brilliant catch. Sairaj Bahutule soon followed as he edged to Shane Warne at slip. It left the home side still 20 short, but Samir Dighe hit Miller for consecutive boundaries and then farmed the strike to see India home despite a furious final burst from McGrath. The Australian paceman found Zaheer Khan's edge to give Mark Waugh his fourth catch of the innings. Earlier the tourists, who began the day on 241-7, added only 23 more runs before they were all out. Harbhajan claimed all the three remaining wickets at a cost of two runs. He removed the main stumbling block, captain Steve Waugh, in the day's eighth over when the batsman edged a catch to Das at forward short-leg. Waugh added just four to his overnight score of 43. Harbhajan then had Gillespie snapped up at backward short-leg by Dravid and trapped Miller lbw to polish off the innings."
454,"Luka Modric has completed his move from Tottenham to Real Madrid for a fee in the region of £30m.  The Croatia midfielder, 26, passed a medical on Monday before signing a five-year contract with the Spanish giants.  ""I'm very happy, honoured and proud to be at the biggest and best club in the world. I'm very excited,"" Modric said.  Spurs also announced they are entering a partnership with Real Madrid.  The agreement will see the two clubs working together in respect of players, coaching and commercial relationships.  ""Luka has been a terrific player for us and, while we preferred not to part with him, we are pleased that it is to Real Madrid, a club with which we now look forward to sharing a long and productive partnership,"" said Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.  Modric joined Tottenham in 2008 in a £16.5m deal from Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb.  He made over 150 appearances for the London club, scoring 17 goals.  Real Madrid president Florentino Perez Rodriguez added: ""We are delighted to welcome Luka and look forward to working closely with Tottenham in the coming years.""  Initially playing as a defensive midfielder under former manager Juande Ramos, Modric was moved into a more advanced role when Harry Redknapp became manager in October 2008.  He developed into an integral part of the Tottenham side before being rewarded for his performances with a new six-year contract in 2010.  Last season, he made 41 appearances for Tottenham, scoring five goals.  Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas has already stated his intention to add to his squad before the transfer window closes on Friday.  They have made three signings this summer, with Emmanuel Adebayor moving from Manchester City for £5m, midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson joining from Hoffenheim and Jan Vertonghen signing from Ajax."
455,"Thousands of cheering supporters turned out to watch him vow revenge for the first Israeli attempt on his life in September 2003.  He was a hate figure for Israelis, described by ministers as the Palestinian Osama Bin Laden, ""his hands tainted with the blood of hundreds of Israelis, children, women and babies"".  As the spiritual leader of one of the largest and most militant of all the Palestinian groups fighting the Israeli occupation, Sheikh Yassin was a prime target for Israelis.  Hamas has killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings and advocates resistance rather than negotiations to get rid of the Israeli occupation.  Born in 1938 in what was then Palestine under the British mandate, Sheikh Yassin's political views were forged at a time of humiliation and defeat for Palestinians.  After a childhood accident left him a quadriplegic, he devoted his early life to Islamic scholarship and studied at al-Azhar university in Cairo, the birthplace of the Muslim Brotherhood.  It was there that he formed the belief that Palestine was an Islamic land ""consecrated for future Muslim generations until Judgement Day"", and that no Arab leader had the right to give up any part of this territory.  Sheikh Yassin became actively involved with a Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood but he did not come to widespread prominence until the first Palestinian intifada of 1987.  It was then that the Palestinian Islamist movement adopted the name Hamas, meaning ""zeal"" and also an Arabic acronym for ""Islamic Resistance Movement"", and he became its spiritual leader.  In 1989, Sheikh Yassin was arrested by the Israelis and sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the killing of Palestinians who had allegedly collaborated with the Israeli army.  He was eventually released in 1997, in a trade-off with Jordan for two Israeli agents involved in an assassination attempt on a Hamas leader in Jordan.  During his time in prison, his importance as a symbol of Palestinian resistance had grown - but his popularity still fell far short of that enjoyed by Yasser Arafat.  Believing that a divided leadership would undermine Palestinian interests, Sheikh Yassin sought to maintain good relations with the Palestinian Authority and with other regimes in the Arab world.  But he remained uncompromising on the issue of peace. ""The so-called peace path is not peace and it is not a substitute for jihad and resistance,"" Sheikh Yassin repeatedly said.  He attacked the outcome of the 2003 Aqaba summit in Jordan, attended by the Israeli and US leaders as well as the then Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, who pledged an end to violence.  Militant groups like Hamas did initially declare a temporary truce, but that unravelled in July 2003 after Israeli forces killed two Hamas members in retaliation for the suicide bombing of a Jerusalem bus that left 21 people dead.  Hamas has been able to build support by offering material help to Palestinians suffering economic hardship during the latest intifada.  It has established charitable funds to establish schools, clinics and hospitals that provide free services to families in distress and has been able to attract millions of dollars from the Gulf and elsewhere.  He inspired them to offer up their lives, promising that suicide bombers who were willing to die for the sake of the dignity of Palestinians and in the service of a longer-term victory would achieve martyrdom.  Attempts to restrict Sheikh Yassin's activities met with fierce resistance from his supporters.  In December 2001, one man died in clashes with Palestinian police after Sheikh Yassin was placed under house arrest.  Shooting erupted again in June 2002 when Palestinian police surrounded his house, following a spate of bloody suicide bombings against Israel.  And, in September 2003, the Israeli army attempted to kill Sheikh Yassin, while he was at the house of a Hamas colleague in Gaza.  His killing in a missile strike on 22 March 2004 was seen by analysts as an attempt to stop his group taking advantage of a proposed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza."
456,"The cost of inquiries into Princess Diana's death is nearing £7m There is ""not a shred of evidence"" that the Duke of Edinburgh ordered Princess Diana's death or that it was organised by MI6, the inquest has heard. Coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker said jurors could find that Diana and Dodi Al Fayed died accidentally, or because of negligence. Many conspiracy theories suggested by Dodi's father Mohamed about the deaths were without foundation, he insisted. The couple died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. Speaking to the jury after six months of evidence, the coroner said many of Mohamed Al Fayed's theories about the crash were ""so demonstrably without foundation"" that even his lawyer was no longer pursuing them. He put aside theories which, he said, had been encouraged by the media for the past 10 years, as he began to go through evidence from more than 250 witnesses. Mohamed Al Fayed was in court to hear the coroner He said of Mr Al Fayed's ideas: ""They are not being pursued because there is not a shred of evidence to support them. ""Foremost among them is the proposition that Diana was assassinated by the secret intelligence service (MI6) on the orders of the Duke of Edinburgh. ""There is no evidence that the Duke of Edinburgh ordered Diana's execution, and there is no evidence that the secret intelligence service or any other Government agency organised it."" He said the lengthy and costly inquest had played a crucial role in testing those theories - but that some people would continue to believe in the murder theory no matter what the verdict was. Of the alleged murder he said: ""There are no doubt those who genuinely believe this to be the case and will continue to do so regardless of any verdict you return. ""You have heard the evidence and it is your decision that matters and not anyone else's. ""You will have been reassured to have heard that Mohamed Al Fayed told you on oath that he will accept your verdict; no doubt the other interested persons will do likewise."" He said that he and the jury - plus one Diana fan who sat through all the proceedings with the words ""Diana"" and ""Dodi"" painted on his face - were the only ones to hear every word of evidence. Lord Baker gave the jury five verdict options, and added: ""I have determined that it is not open to you to find that this was unlawful killing by the Duke of Edinburgh or anyone else in a staged accident."" The five options included unlawful killing by grossly negligent driving of the paparazzi in the following vehicles; unlawful killing through the gross negligence of the driver Henri Paul; and unlawful killing by the grossly negligent driving of both the following vehicles and Mr Paul. A verdict of accidental death could be returned if none of the previous verdicts are established. The jury was also given the option of an open verdict. Lord Baker said it was regrettable that there had been some witnesses ""who it appears have told lies in the witness box or elsewhere"", naming former butler Paul Burrell as one of those who were ""liars by their own admission"". Mr Burrell appeared at the inquest for three days in January, but in a video recording obtained by the Sun newspaper he apparently claimed he introduced ""red herrings"" during his evidence and held back facts. He then refused to re-appear at the inquest to explain discrepancies between his evidence and comments reported in the newspaper. At the time, the coroner said he could not compel him to give evidence because Mr Burrell lives outside the court's jurisdiction in the US."
457,"The books were flown on board a chartered airliner which took off from the Punjabi city of Amritsar.  Hundreds of Sikhs came out of their homes to cheer an unusual procession.  Devotees carried silk-covered copies of the book on their heads over a four-kilometre distance (2.5 miles), to Amritsar international airport.  State Chief Minister Amarinder Singh was among those who considered themselves fortunate for the chance to help carry the holy books into the aircraft.  Each copy of the Guru Granth Sahib was reverentially placed on a separate seat.  Religious officials said that on arrival in Toronto the flight would be personally met by Prime Minister Paul Martin and leaders of Canada's Sikh community.  The Sikh religious body based in Amritsar says it is the sole worldwide publisher of the Guru Granth Sahib, since the printing needs to conform to the Sikh code of conduct, or maryada.  This is because Sikhs revere their holy book as a living Guru.  In view of the huge demand for copies of the holy book in Western nations, the committee is now actively considering proposals to establish a suitable printing facility in Canada.  This facility, to be paid for by the Canadian Sikh community, will need to be identical to that operated in Amritsar.  But until that is done, officials say, copies of the Guru Granth Sahib will have to be transported from India."
458,"Warner artists like REM may no longer be available to stream for free Record label Warner Music has said it will stop licensing its songs to free music streaming services. Companies like Spotify, We7 and Last.fm give free, legal and instant access to millions of songs, funded by adverts. Warner, one of the four major labels, whose artists include REM and Michael Buble, said such services were ""clearly not positive for the industry"". That raises questions over the future of free streaming, which is popular with fans but not lucrative for labels. Spotify has seven million users in six European countries and is in negotiations to launch in the US. Ninety-five per cent of those fans use its free service, hearing adverts between songs, while 250,000 pay a monthly fee to get it on a mobile and with no ads. [It] is not the kind of approach to business that we will be supporting in the future    Two-and-a-half million people use We7's free offering, while Last.fm is also free in the US and UK. Warner chief executive Edgar Bronfman Jr said: ""Free streaming services are clearly not net positive for the industry and as far as Warner Music is concerned will not be licensed. ""The 'get all your music you want for free, and then maybe with a few bells and whistles we can move you to a premium price' strategy is not the kind of approach to business that we will be supporting in the future."" It is not clear whether Warner will remove its music from existing services or decline to do deals with new outlets. He said the focus would be on promoting streaming services that require payment, which he said could appeal beyond those who currently pay for downloads in stores such as Apple's iTunes. Spotify is free with ads, or fans can pay £9.99 a month in the UK ""The number of potential subscribers dwarfs the number of people who are actually purchasing music on iTunes,"" Mr Bronfman said. Fans could pay a monthly fee direct to a streaming service, as with Spotify, or get access to the music as part of a deal for a mobile phone, broadband connection or another gadget. Such subscriptions could be taken up by ""hundreds of millions if not billions of people, most of whom are not today either buyers or certainly heavy buyers of music"", Mr Bronfman said. And they would be much more profitable than per-track downloads in the long term, he added. The main legal streaming services have deals with most major and independent record labels and pay royalties for each song played. But the amount is far less than a label would earn if that song was downloaded or if they got a slice of a listener's monthly subscription. It would definitely be a tremendous blow to a service like Spotify if Warner were to withdraw their catalogue from the free service    Mr Bronfman's comments come just weeks after another major label, Universal, said Spotify was well on the way to proving its commercial viability. ""Spotify is a very sustainable financial model - full stop,"" Rob Wells, senior vice president of Universal Music Group International, said in January. Paul Brindley of digital music consultants Music Ally said the other major labels were unlikely to follow Warners' lead. ""There's a fairly widespread suspicion that free streaming services just aren't ever going to make enough money,"" he said. ""But it does seem to be that Warner is taking a firmer stand than the other major labels in terms of opposing a free ad-funded model. ""It would be an absolute tragedy if they were to adhere to that to such a degree that in their renegotiations with Spotify, they withdrew their content without even giving them a chance to see how well they could convert their users to the premium version. The consumer is in a world where they want things right here, right now, and if you don't give it to them they'll steal it    ""It would definitely be a tremendous blow to a service like Spotify if Warner were to withdraw their catalogue from the free service."" A Spotify spokesman told the BBC: ""We would like to make it very clear that WMG is not pulling out of its current agreement with Spotify in Europe"". We7 chief executive Steve Purdham said Warner and the other major labels had always been ""consistent in their concerns"" about ad-funded and free services. ""But they have also been very supportive of us. I think Edgar's comments are more a reflection that subscription services is currently the key focus for the industry and I strongly support that view, especially in the mobile arenas."" Jon Webster, chief executive of the UK's Music Managers' Forum, which represents artist managers, said the industry must support services that tempt fans away from piracy. ""Anything that's going backwards is denying where the world's going,"" he said. ""New media has to give the consumer what they want and the consumer is in a world where they want things right here, right now - and if you don't give it to them, they'll steal it. ""There are new business models out there and they are beginning to work and we are in a transition phase.""     "

460,"A major London road remained open for weeks after a report warned of a small risk it could collapse at any moment.  Hammersmith Flyover, used by 90,000 vehicles a day, was shut on 23 December 2011 as salt water from gritting had rotted internal steel cables.  But a draft report obtained by BBC London showed months earlier Transport for London (TfL) knew it could have seen a ""sudden catastrophic collapse"".  TfL said monitoring suggested a ""number of years of life"" left in the bridge.  The Emergency Preparedness Plan, which was written on 29 October 2011, was obtained through a Freedom of Information request.  It also detailed how TfL would respond to a collapse, outlining co-operation with emergency services, an exclusion zone, debris removal and PR strategy.  The report reads: ""The immediate plans are to install some form of temporary structure beneath the flyover, to strengthen it and prevent the likelihood of a sudden collapse, however remote the possibility.  ""It is likely to be 3‐4 months before construction can commence.  ""Until this structure is in place there is a very remote possibility that Hammersmith Flyover will collapse.""  Not only does the high structure carry heavy traffic, but roads and pedestrians pass underneath.  John Knapton, a highway engineer and concrete expert, said: ""The report was saying if the bridge collapsed it would do so without any warning whatsoever - and would be more likely to do so when traffic was there, because of the weight.  ""There is also the danger of things going on beneath the flyover. You would expect fatalities.""  Mr Knapton, who advised the government on lessons learned from the Twin Towers collapse, argues at the very least TfL should have put in place a 7.5 tonne weight restriction.  But this was not done.  A TfL spokesman admitted a strengthening prop system only came into effect on 27 November.  That means the at-risk bridge was open to all traffic - without additional support - for more than four weeks after the collapse warning.  Mr Knapton said there have been similar ""catastrophic"" bridge collapses in the US and developing countries.  And Ynys-y-Gwas Bridge in south-west Wales - built to a similar design as the flyover - suddenly collapsed in 1985 after metal tendons corroded.  A motorist whose car tumbled into the river below was lucky to escape.  Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, said: ""It horrifies me. They flatly denied what now appears to be the case - that they knew there was this danger, however small, of imminent collapse.  ""It is extraordinary and I'm almost lost for words - not so lost for words that I won't be taking this up with them now and asking them to completely come clean.""  TfL's surface transport boss Garrett Emmerson said: ""There's always a possibility of any structure collapsing, however remote, for whatever reason.  ""The monitoring we undertook indicated a number of years of life in the structure, so it could carry on taking heavy goods vehicle loadings.""  After inheriting the flyover in 2000, TfL began using audio equipment to monitor cable deterioration.  A spokesman said: ""TfL is satisfied it took appropriate action based on the information available at the time to ensure restrictions were not applied unnecessarily.""  BBC Inside Out has also obtained the most recent inspection report into all 36 TfL flyovers.  Some 27 were considered a ""medium risk"", defined as: ""Superficial or moderate defects or damage, capacity may be slightly or significantly affected.""  Seven flyovers were in ""poor"" or ""very poor"" condition, with capacity significantly affected.  Every flyover had non-cosmetic defects, with the BBC counting 541 in all - an average of 15 each.  Four flyovers were deemed to be in ""good"" or ""very good"" condition.  Blackwall Lane Viaduct had the most defects, with 34.  And there were concerning comments on the A406 Flyover. The report notes: ""TfL's attention is drawn to the condition of Maurer expansion joints.  ""The risk of joint failure is significant and unpredictable, leading to a possible major road accident.  ""This should be addressed by special investigation as a matter of urgency.""  TfL refused to confirm whether this has been addressed.  Meanwhile the assessment of Westway Flyover Section 5 branded it ""high risk"".  That is defined as: ""Severe defects, one or more elements failed, structure unserviceable, possible failure of a critical element, may need to be weight restricted or closed.""  The BBC asked John Knapton to carry out a visual inspection of the flyover.  He found numerous vertical cracks with white marks along the concrete - salt that had got into the structure from gritting.  Mr Knapton said the salt was likely to be ""in the bridge right now corroding the embedded steel"".  There is an alternative to salt grit, a chemical called CMS. But TfL admitted this winter all but one of its flyovers will be laced with salt grit.  A spokesman insisted Hammersmith Flyover was the only structure where CMS was needed.  He said TfL has a programme of inspection and maintenance that will ensure all London's flyovers remain safe for years.  Inside Out tried to obtain reports on London flyovers controlled by the Highways Agency. But the agency refused the Freedom of Information request on cost grounds.  BBC Inside Out is on BBC One in the London region on Monday, 3 December at 19:30 GMT and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter."
461,"Life is speeding up. News travels fast, data is everywhere and buzzing gadgets keep our schedules ticking over. What can we learn from the physics of the very, very slow?  In two famous - and famously lengthy - experiments, scientists wait for pitch to drip from a funnel. It happens about once a decade, because pitch is a substance so viscous that it is, to all intents and purposes, a solid. Lives have come and gone while the drops went undripped, or fell unwitnessed.  Recently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up.  The invisible, inevitable progress of these inky half-fluids has captured the public's attention; the drops have acquired meaning and drama.  But alongside the storytelling, Dr Kostya Trachenko is adamant there are important measurements to be made. He and his undergraduate students at Queen Mary University of London put their pitch into five different funnels, with different sized openings.  Pitch, or bitumen, is the black muck left over from distilling crude oil, and can also be produced by heating wood. It is a liquid at high temperatures but becomes very hard when it cools down, which makes it useful in waterproofing and road surfacing.  At normal room temperature, in fact, a lump of pitch can be shattered with a hammer.  ""We convincingly saw that it behaves like a liquid,"" Dr Trachenko says as he shows me the set-up, clearly proud of his students' work. ""And we were also able to quantify it - because in physics it's important to attach a number to the process.""  As you would predict for a liquid, the bigger openings let more pitch through: almost 53g over the course of a year for the widest (6mm), compared to 5g for the narrowest (2.5mm).  This rate is positively heart-stopping by comparison with the best-known experiment of this kind, which began in Brisbane, Australia, in 1927. There, at the University of Queensland, Prof Thomas Parnell let some pitch solidify in the top of a funnel - and waited.  Prof Parnell, a Cambridge graduate and veteran of World War One, wanted to show his students that if you watched it for long enough, it would still flow like a liquid.  It was a long wait. The funnel dripped its first drop in 1938 and only eight more have fallen since.  In 1961, just three drops later, a new lecturer called John Mainstone adopted the experiment after a colleague pointed it out, gathering dust in a cupboard. He eventually persuaded the university to put it on display and the drops became talking points.  Prof Mainstone, however, never saw the pitch in motion. In 1979, the sixth drop went on a weekend. In 1988, with the experiment proudly displayed at Brisbane's World Expo, Prof Mainstone was fetching a drink when the seventh drop fell. By 2000, a video camera had been set up to capture drop number eight, but it malfunctioned at the crucial moment.  When the ninth drop fell in April this year it was watched by three webcams and thousands of online enthusiasts - but not by Prof Mainstone, who died eight months earlier at the age of 78.  The Queensland experiment itself was pipped to the post of posterity in July 2013, when another long-standing funnel of pitch became the first to drip a drop in public. At Trinity College Dublin, a very similar set-up dating from 1944 was filmed as it shed a black blob into its own beaker, offering the first ever glimpse of such an event taking place.  Dr Shane Bergin, a physicist and senior research fellow at Trinity, explains that it was the feeling of suspense in the Brisbane story that rekindled interest in the Dublin drop. ""Eventually, when our one was caught on camera, it provided the world with a kind of scientific 'Aaaah' moment,"" he says. ""As in, finally, we see it!  ""In a world where we expect to expect things to happen very quickly, and stuff is demanded of us instantaneously, it's a little quirky to think that a lot of stuff just happens on a time scale that's much slower than we can normally appreciate.""  All this drawn-out drama could be accelerated, of course, if the pitch was warmed up. Pitch is one of a group of substances called ""glasses"" which, when cooled, become hard and solid-seeming, despite maintaining the jumbled molecular structure of a liquid. There is no obvious shift to a more rigid, crystalline organisation of molecules, which happens when water and other liquids freeze. Glasses just get steadily slower and stiffer as the temperature drops.  So the famous experiments, Dr Trachenko insists, could be made even drearier. ""If you put it in the fridge, it would take thousands of years,"" he points out, with a dry smile. ""For a theorist like myself, 70 years is actually not that long.""  Window glass belongs in the same category, but debate has raged for years among physicists as to whether solid glass in fact represents a different ""phase"" of matter. Dr Trachenko believes that all of the pitch drop results, including those of his students' project, are important evidence to the contrary.  ""Even though glass is a familiar system, explaining how it forms is a big deal in modern physics research,"" he says.  ""Once we assume that the behaviour is essentially liquid-like... we can come up with equations to predict how long it would take for solid glass to flow, even though we would never ever see it.""  Dr Trachenko is firmly in the camp that sees glass as ""merely a very viscous liquid"" and has published calculations and models in support of that view, based on the way it absorbs heat and behaves under pressure.  The popular myth, however, that ancient windows are thicker at the bottom because the glass has sagged with the centuries, is wide of the mark. They have thicker edges because they were made that way, Dr Trachenko is quick to explain.  To see glass flow would take an almost unimaginably long time, he says - but it would happen.  ""If you wait longer than the age of the universe, you'll see this as a liquid."" Dr Trachenko taps the glass cabinet that houses his students' pitch funnels. ""It would flow. And that would be the end of it.""  That is a long wait to win an argument. In the meantime, he relies on maths.  ""For physicists, one billion years is not much different from one second. It's just a number. It's an extremely long number, but I can quantify the process.""  And to go with the numbers, he now has observations from the dribbles of bitumen inside the cabinet.  Their comparatively speedy flow, with multiple drips from multiple funnels, allowed Dr Trachenko's students to calculate - and publish - the average ""viscosity"" of their pitch, measured in units called pascal-seconds. (About eight million pascal-seconds, to be precise.)  By that measure, they estimate it is thirty times runnier than the pitch used in Queensland, a million times runnier than glass, and a hundred billion times thicker than water.  Relative runniness can be important. A recently rediscovered pitch drop experiment at Aberystwyth University in Wales actually predates the famous Queensland funnel by 13 years - but its pitch is stiffer and has never yielded a single drop.  In fact, it has barely entered the stem of the funnel and is unlikely to bear fruit for at least 1,300 years.  The Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow, meanwhile, contains two remarkable demonstrations set up in the 1800s by renowned physicist Lord Kelvin. Intrigued by some of the same questions as Drs Parnell, Mainstone and Trachenko, Kelvin placed bullets on top of a dish of hard, black pitch, and corks at the bottom: over time, the bullets sank and the corks floated.  Lord Kelvin also showed that the flow of pitch is genuinely glacial, with a mahogany ramp that allowed it to slide imperceptibly downward and form similar shapes and patterns to rivers of ice in the Alps.  The inexorable intrigue of these experiments exerts an obvious pull on our imagination.  ""People are genuinely curious,"" says Dr Bergin from Dublin, where the Trinity College pitch drop is slated to be moved into a public exhibition space. ""We want to use it as a hook to show that physics tries to understand the universe, from the nitty gritty to the super duper, and all of the wacky stuff that's in there as well.  ""We're going to start a new, bigger pitch drop here in Trinity as well. We figured, why not?""  Back in London, Dr Trachenko similarly loves the idea of challenging the intuitions of his students - and the public. ""It reminds people that the physical world is not about us,"" he says. ""We are just passers-by.""  But he also maintains that there are real findings to be made.  Modelling how materials like glass behave in the longest of long terms, Dr Trachenko says, could help plan for the safe disposal of nuclear waste that takes millions of years to decay. ""That's not an experiment you can check in the lab.""  He is clearly not finished with pitch - nor with his students.  ""There are two jars on my shelf,"" he says with a hint of mischief. ""The second one is more viscous.""  As soon as the fastest flowing funnel in his current set-up is empty, Dr Trachenko is obviously itching to test out the even stickier stuff. He guesses that the next crop of students might need the entire length of their degree to get results.  ""If they measure the viscosity of that one, then maybe they can hope for an extra grade.""  And if they learn from history as well as physics, his students will be checking their camera twice."
462,"China says it has cracked a terror plot to kidnap athletes, journalists and tourists at August's Beijing Olympics.  The security ministry said 35 arrests had been made in recent weeks and explosives seized in the north-western Xinjiang province.  It said 10 others were held when police smashed another plot based in Xinjiang back in January to disrupt the Games.  The province is home to many Muslim Uighurs, some of whom want independence in the region they call East Turkestan.  Uighur activists have accused the Chinese authorities of fabricating terror plots to crack down on the people of the region and prevent them airing legitimate grievances.  Thursday's development was announced by a Ministry of Public Security spokesman at a news conference.  Wu Heping was quoted by AFP news agency as saying: ""The violent terrorist group plotted to kidnap foreign journalists, tourists and athletes during the Beijing Olympics.""  Mr Wu said two terror rings had been smashed by the authorities and that militants had planned to launch attacks to disrupt the Olympics from next month.  In recent weeks, he said, police had seized nearly 10kg (22lb) of explosives and ""jihadist"" literature during raids in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi.  He said the militants had sought volunteers to carry out suicide bombings in Urumqi and other Chinese cities.  Mr Wu also provided more details on another alleged plot, which the authorities said they had smashed last month.  He said those militants had planned to attack hotels and government offices in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities.  Poisonings and remote-control bombings were planned and 13 practice explosions had already been carried out, he said.  China said last month a plane crew had foiled a hijack attempt of a flight from Xinjiang to Beijing and two passengers had been detained.  But some observers question if China is inflating a terror threat to justify a clampdown on dissent ahead of the Olympics.  China brands the Xinjiang separatists as terrorists and has claimed more than 260 terror acts have been committed in the province over the past two decades.  Many in Xinjiang resent the recent and large-scale influx into the region of Han Chinese settlers, observers say, though there have been few reports of violence.  At the 1972 Munich Olympics, Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and killed nine Israeli athletes."
463,"Megson's dismissal came after he told chairman Jeremy Peace he would quit at the end of his contract in June.  ""The club accepts this as a letter of resignation,"" said a statement by the club, who have installed assistant boss Frank Burrow as caretaker.  ""The board believes it's now in the best interests of WBA that Gary Megson no longer remains in charge of team affairs,"" the statement added.  The club have issued instructions to the Albion squad not to speak to the media over Megson's dismissal.  Megson has had a roller-coaster reign at West Brom, guiding the club to promotion twice but appearing to be constantly on the verge of leaving.  Megson's departure had been on the cards for some time after his public falling-out with chairman Jeremy Peace over summer transfer spending.  While Megson believed he did not have sufficient funds to mount a realistic battle for Premiership survival, Peace expected more after landing the likes of Kanu, Jonathan Greening and £3m striker Robert Earnshaw.  The acrimony was evident with Albion calling the timing of Megson's letter - three days after a dismal 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace - ""extremely unhelpful"".  In a official statement Albion said: ""This is a crucial period for the club and the board regards the timing and manner of Gary Megson's announcement as extremely unhelpful, particularly following the team's disappointing performance at Crystal Palace on Saturday.  ""Nevertheless, the board intends to move swiftly to appoint a new manager who will be fully focused on the job of taking the club forward in the Premiership.  ""Until such time, Frank Burrows will act as caretaker manager.""  ""The board would like to acknowledge Gary Megson's major contribution during his term as manager and wishes him well in the future.""  Megson had brought the situation to a head when he revealed: ""I won't sign a new contract. I don't intend to talk any more about the decision I have made.  ""I have a contract until 30 June and I intend to carry on doing my job until then.  ""I will give all the effort and drive that I can to succeed on behalf of the football club.  ""If training is not going good enough, if the results don't go the right way, I will continue to be upset about it.""  Megson was yet to be offered a new deal by Peace and as the weeks went by his chances of getting one appeared increasingly remote.  The manager had joined the club from Stoke where he spent just four months in charge before the club was taken over by an Icelandic consortium who wanted their own hierarchy.  In his first season Megson rescued Albion from relegation to the old second division and in the following campaign he steered them into the play-offs.  In 2002, Megson was awarded a new three-year contract after Albion famously overhauled Black Country rivals Wolves to clinch their first Premiership place.  But Megson's accomplishments were marred by boardroom disagreements.  He threatened to leave the club after a row with Peace's predecessor Paul Thompson during the promotion season of 2001-02.  And old wounds reopened again this summer when Megson professed himself unhappy with the way the club was moving under Peace.  West Brom, who have won just once this season, sit two points above the relegation zone.  The team's next game is against Chelsea at home on Saturday."
464,"Almost an entire battalion of Russian soldiers committed suicide last year, the country's chief military prosecutor has said.  A total of 341 military personnel killed themselves in 2007, a reduction of 15% on the previous year.  But Sergei Fridinsky said the numbers were worrying and called for a national strategy to prepare men for service.  Bullying, often extremely violent, is rife in the army and is the most common reason for suicide.  ""Almost a battalion of military servicemen - 341 people - were irrevocably lost in the past year as a result of suicide,"" Mr Fridinsky said.  The BBC's Russia analyst, Steven Eke, says dedovshchina - literally, rule of the elders, a culturally specific, often very violent, form of bullying, is cited as the most frequent trigger for young soldiers taking their own lives.  Conditions of military service - compulsory for one year for Russian men - are so harsh that many parents and young men offer bribes to avoid getting conscripted.  Yet Mr Fridinsky said that about half of the suicides were among professional, contract-based soldiers, who would not face this kind of bullying.  He suggested that Russia use the experience of the US in Iraq and Afghanistan to help their troops deal with the psychological trauma of combat."
465,"Southport manager Alan Wright has left the Conference Premier side by mutual consent with them 18th in the table.  The 42-year-old was in charge for six months, having replaced previous boss Liam Watson in May, and leaves after losing the last six games.  The role was his first in management, having had spells as a coach at Blackpool, Fleetwood and Northwich.  ""Football is a results-driven business and our recent run led to this decision,"" a club statement read.  The former Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers defender made 304 Premier League appearances during his playing career, and was looking to improve on the Sandgrounders' 20th-placed finish in the league last season.  However, after his side's poor start to the season, Wright and the club decided to go their separate ways.  ""An appointment to replace Alan will be made by the time of our next fixture on 21 December when we face Salisbury,"" a club spokesperson told BBC Sport.  ""We need to have dignity for Alan and so it is not appropriate to talk about who the next manager will be.  ""No-one wanted Alan in this situation and it is with great regret we part company."""
466,Some of you who spend a lot of time online will have spotted a minor slip-up on the site yesterday when we ran a gallery of readers’ suggestions for alternative designs to the new London Olympics logo. Turned out that one of them was a thinly disguised parody of a notorious internet shock website.  No offence intended – we simply didn’t spot it and as soon as we did we took it down.
467,"The designs were part of Oor Wullie's Bucket Trail, which saw 55 of the sculptures displayed across Dundee, with the remainder touring Scotland.  An original design was bought for £50,000 by businessman Garreth Wood, raising the highest individual amount.  About 20,000 people visited a ""farewell exhibition"" of the sculptures in Dundee at the weekend.  The statues were displayed for 10 weeks before being auctioned to raise funds for the Archie Foundation's Tayside Children's Hospital Appeal.  They included a Tim Peake-inspired ""Astro Wullie"", which raised £12,000, a design commemorating David Bowie, which went under the hammer for £19,000 and a design inspired by computer game Minecraft which fetched £34,000.  Tangerine Terror, a sculpture inspired by Dundee United FC, was bought for £16,000 by the club's chairman, Stephen Thompson.  The charity's director of fundraising Cassie Thompson said the amount raised was ""amazing"".  She said: ""I can't put it into words how i feel right now.  ""It has exceeded our expectations so much more than I ever thought.  ""The generosity in the room and on the internet, I mean it just goes to show how Oor Wullie, a national iconic character, just how far-reaching it has been.  The auction was held at Dundee Rep Theatre."
468,"Thousands of people are set to flood the Ukrainian capital Kiev for Saturday's final of the Eurovision Song Contest.  The event is the biggest international event staged in the country, which also hosts the semi-final on Thursday.  Up to 10,000 people are expected in the capital - many have already arrived.  Ukraine is determined to put on a good show following the turmoil of the ""Orange Revolution"".  Mass protests on the streets of the capital last year led to the opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko taking office.  ""Ukraine has come such a long way since Ruslana won Eurovision last year. Her victory meant a lot for the dignity of Ukrainians,"" the president said.  Following his inauguration Mr Yushchenko admitted that Ukraine's reputation was at stake if Ukraine failed to successfully host Eurovision. Two cabinet ministers were then put in charge.  Ukraine had been due to spend around 5m euros from the state budget on hosting the contest. But that figure was more than doubled a few months ago.  To encourage people to come, visa restrictions were lifted to people from the European Union and Switzerland from 1 May.  ""This contest is a serious step for Ukraine towards the EU,"" Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Tomenko said at the official opening of the competition.  ""I would like the slogan of Eurovision in Ukraine to be very simple: Ukraine and Europe together forever.""  There had been fears Ukraine would not be ready.  Last year's demonstrations by the opposition severely delayed preparations for Eurovision.  But in the last few weeks, the inside of the venue known as the Sports Palace has been dramatically transformed.  A huge glass stage has been installed complete with state-of-the-art technology.  The outside of the venue has been entirely covered in green material to hide what is normally an ugly Soviet building.  ""I'm so excited that Eurovision is being held in my home city,"" says Tanya, a student who is going to watch the final at the Sports Palace.  ""There's such a positive and vibrant atmosphere. I can't wait for the big day.""  As people continue to pour into Kiev, there is still a problem with the lack of accommodation.  None of the promised new hotels are ready and it is thought this may have put off some Eurovision fans from coming to Ukraine.  Away from crowds on an island in the middle of a river in the capital, there is plenty of room.  The site is run by the same people who helped to organise the original tent city.  ""We know that many foreigners saw the Orange Revolution on the television and now when they come to Eurovision we want to show that part of history,"" says EuroCamp spokeswoman Nina Sorokopud.  ""We want people to feel how it was, that atmosphere of solidarity.""  There is enough space for up to 5,000 campers. Conditions are quite basic and so far there are just over 200 people staying there.  Back in the city centre there are green posters everywhere advertising Eurovision.  The organisers say this symbolises ""the dawn of a new age for both the song contest and Ukraine itself"".  Many people here hope that Eurovision will help the country to shine on the international stage and allow Ukraine to become known for something other than protests."
469,"""The agency and its officers did not discharge their responsibilities in a satisfactory manner,"" the CIA inspector general wrote in a scathing report.  The document was completed in June 2005 and kept classified until now. Its release was ordered by Congress.  Mr Tenet, former CIA director, said the inspector general was ""flat wrong"".  But some former CIA employees have told the BBC that the criticisms are justified.  Mr Tenet, who enjoyed strong support from President George W Bush, resigned in 2004 citing ""personal reasons"".  The review team led by Inspector General John Helgerson found no ""single point of failure"" that would have stopped the attacks on 11 September 2001.  But he says US spy agencies lacked a comprehensive plan to counter al-Qaeda.  The report concludes that Mr Tenet, ""by virtue of his position, bears ultimate responsibility for the fact that no such strategic plan was ever created"".  It adds that various bodies ""did not always work effectively and cooperatively"".  Mr Helgerson called for accountability boards to look at the performance of Mr Tenet and his aides.  Such a move was rejected after the internal report was submitted to CIA leaders.  Current CIA Director Michael Hayden said the decision to release the report was not his preference, but that he was making it available as required by Congress in a law signed by Mr Bush earlier this month.  ""I thought the release of this report would distract officers serving their country on the front lines of a global conflict,"" he said.  The BBC's James Coomarasamy says the criticism is in keeping with previous inquiries into the 11 September attacks.  It is notable, however, for having an unusually critical tone for an internal inquiry and for its personal criticism of Mr Tenet.  In a statement, the former CIA director said he had implemented a ""robust plan, marked by extraordinary effort and dedication to fighting terrorism, dating back to long before 9/11"".  ""Without such an effort,"" Mr Tenet added, ""we would not have been able to give the president a plan on September 15, 2001, that led to the routing of the Taleban... and combating terrorists across 92 countries"".  But former CIA analyst Ray McGovern told the BBC the inspector general's criticism was justified.  ""... [George Tenet] was too busy schmoozing with foreign leaders and getting sort of swamped with the detail that he forgot that his job was to manage the intelligence community and so the cracks such as existed became wider and wider. He didn't talk to the FBI and 9/11 happened.""  Meanwhile, the former head of the CIA's Osama bin Laden unit, Michael Scheuer, described the agency's rank-and-file employees under Mr Tenet as ""lions led by asses"".  ""Many of the difficulties that were listed in that report today - the inability to share information, the lack of people to support and run operations against Osama bin Laden - those were problems that were brought to Mr Tenet's attention as early as 1996 and he never did anything about them,"" he told the BBC.  Our correspondent says the administration has already taken steps to address some criticisms against the intelligence community, making this latest report more of an interesting historical document than a consequential one.  But Lori Van Auken - whose husband, Kenneth, died in the World Trade Center attack - said of the report: ""We're talking about complete and utter incompetence, and people should be held accountable and we should know who they are..."""
470,"""There is no clear diagnosis,"" said Palestinian envoy to the UN Nasser al-Kidwa, but he declined to confirm that Mr Arafat had not been poisoned.  Mr Arafat died in a military hospital in France on 11 November from a so-far unexplained illness.  France handed over the records to Mr Kidwa, who is also Mr Arafat's nephew, despite objections from his widow.  Mr Kidwa told a news conference that he had not had time to study the full report - which is 558 pages long - and was speaking from a non-medical standpoint.  Mr Kidwa added that the Palestinian people had the right to know the truth about how their 75-year-old leader had died.  The issue of Arafat's cause of death has been clouded by a row between the Palestinian Authority and his widow, Suha Arafat.  Her lawyers argued that under French law she alone had the right to see the report and to choose whether to divulge it.  ""I can understand the feeling of a wife to keep the information and to remain the unique source but we have to consider the political view... not only the personal,"" Mr Kidwa told journalists.  ""Arafat does not belong to a person or a family, but the whole Palestinian people.""  He said he would hand over the report to the Palestinian Authority, which had set up a committee to study it."

472,"Johnny Ball and Fern Britton are among the 14 celebrities who will take part in this year's Strictly Come Dancing.  Also competing are Olympic stars Louis Smith and Victoria Pendleton, model Jerry Hall, Kimberley Walsh of Girls Aloud and cricketer Michael Vaughan.  Denise Van Outen and actor Colin Salmon will take part alongside EastEnders' Sid Owen and Westlife's Nicky Byrne.  Actress Dani Harmer, Daybreak's Richard Arnold and ex-Emmerdale star Lisa Riley will also line up in Saturday's show.  In the first episode the stars will be matched with their professional dance partners.  At 74, former children's TV host Johnny Ball is the oldest competitor to participate in this year's show.  His daughter Zoe hosts Strictly's spin-off show It Takes Two, and Ball revealed it had been a challenge keeping his involvement under wraps.  ""I kept it secret from Zoe for over six weeks, which I hated doing as we tell each other everything,"" he said. ""She is over the moon with excitement.  ""I know that on It Takes Two she will be as impartial as it is possible to be for a girl who loves her dad. For me, the great worry is causing her embarrassment.""  Ball and his fellow contestants will hope to follow in the footsteps of McFly drummer Harry Judd, winner of last year's competition.  Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly will return as hosts, while returning judges Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman will be joined by ballet star Darcey Bussell.  Bussell previously appeared as a guest judge on the show and will now become a full-time member of the panel.  Previous panellist Alesha Dixon left at the end of the last series to join ITV1 show Britain's Got Talent.  Saturday's show will feature a red carpet event and a dance number around BBC Television Centre featuring the professional dancers, judges and hosts.  British cyclist Pendleton, who retired from her sport after winning gold and silver medals at the London 2012 Games, had previously spoken of her desire to take part in the show.  She said the show gives her something to ""focus on"" after the Olympics but admitted she was intimidated by fellow Team GB star Louis Smith.  The gymnast, she said, ""can probably dance loads better than I can - and he can do tricks as well. He's going to be flipping onto the dance floor, that's what I imagine.  ""I have no dance experience which is slightly concerning,"" the 31-year-old continued. ""People might feel sorry for me - I hope so.""  Smith, 23, won a silver medal in the pommel horse event and previously displayed his singing talents as a contestant on The X Factor.  Harmer, best known for playing Tracy Beaker on CBBC, was the first celebrity to be unveiled ahead of the latest Strictly series.  Walsh, whose involvement was confirmed over the weekend, has since tweeted a photo of herself practising with dancer Anton du Beke.  Salmon has appeared in the James Bond and Resident Evil film series, while Riley is known to millions of soap fans as Emmerdale's Mandy Dingle.  Strictly Comes Dancing begins on 15 September on BBC One at 18:30 BST.  Full details of all this year's participants can be found on the show's official website."
473,"He said officials in Iran could never believe there were no complex hidden messages in his film.  ""My objective is not to test the limits of censorship,"" he said.  He said there was no chance of Iran honouring his work in the way the V&A Museum in London was hosting a retrospective in his honour.  He added that Iran's ban on him and other directors was at ""status quo"".  ""Nobody is doing anything to change it,"" he said. ""I have accepted it as a reality"".  Kiarostami, who won the Cannes Palme d'Or in 1997, says that his films offer simple messages, such as the lack of rights of women in 2002's Ten.  ""Ironically, even in these simple films the (Iranian) authorities think there must be a complex hidden message behind it,"" Kiarostami said.  ""What you need to appreciate is that the authorities have neither a quarrel with me nor my films. They have a quarrel with the audience of my films.  ""It is because they as a group represent a force - that is why they are perceived as being a possible problem.""  The exhibition at the V&A, featuring installation art and photography, runs until 19 June."
474,"Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s.  The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the ""pride of the pipsqueakery"".  The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been ""brutally drab"".  And he accused music paper NME of being out to ""get Morrissey"" in the 1990s.  The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994.  He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and ""steps inside and stays for two years"".  ""For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone,"" he wrote.  He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a ""mewling miniature monster"" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an ""uncluttered commitment"".  Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of ""constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue"" in court.  This is Morrissey's chance to right every perceived wrong in his life - teachers, the NME, judges (50 pages), John Peel... Even The Thompson Twins, who stopped The Smiths' debut album from getting to number one. However, it is a thoroughly entertaining read, with a laugh-out-loud moment every couple of pages. Michael Stipe is criticised for not brushing his teeth before an REM gig. His primary school teacher is described as the sort ""who will never marry and will die smelling of attics"". There are revelations: Love affairs with a man and a woman; a thorough analysis of The Smiths' break-up (Johnny Marr was the ""master"", Morrissey ""the servant""); and enough titbits to delight fans (he was a 100 metres champion, turned down a part in Friends, and is a fan of A-ha). There is also beautiful writing. Manchester of the late '60s is described as ""an old fire, wheezing its last, where we all worry ourselves soulless, forbidden to be romantic"".  The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together.  The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an ""unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths"".  ""The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!"" Morrissey wrote.  Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey.  When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr ""pinned him to the swivel chair"".  Travis, Morrissey drily noted, ""would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan"" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed ""saved his life and made it count in the long run"".  The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and ""allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'"".  In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: ""Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?""  The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was ""Kafka-esque in its nightmare"".  One teacher, he recounted, ""stands and stares and stands and stares"" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over.  ""At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine,"" Morrissey wrote.  The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as ""a last-minute content disagreement""."
475,"A Shropshire cliffside railway which first operated in 1892 has been put up for sale.  Bridgnorth Cliff Railway is the last remaining inland funicular in England.  It is being sold as a going concern for between £700,000 and £800,000 by husband and wife Allan and Jean Reynolds, who have run it for 15 years.  The sale includes the Grade II listed buildings at the top and bottom of the cliff which are currently used as a guest house and tea rooms.  The railway transports people up and down the 111ft sandstone cliffs that separate High Town from Low Town, and the River Severn.  Two cars on parallel tracks, connected by steel ropes, counterbalance each other - as one rises to the top station, the other runs to the bottom station.  The cars are now powered by an electric winding engine, but were originally driven by a system of water balance.  Mr and Mrs Reynolds put the railway on the market this week because they have decided to retire.  Mrs Reynolds said: ""We've got two sorts of customers.  ""One is local Bridgnorth people who use it as part of the transport system simply to get from Low Town to High Town because the shops and the doctors and chemist are in High Town so it's really quite important.  ""We are also a tourist attraction and we get a lot of visitors.""  She said they had spent the last 15 years updating and preserving the railway and were ""anxious"" that it went to the right people.  ""It really needs someone to carry on where we've left off and look after it,"" she said.  She added that at the height of the tourist season the railway makes 200 journeys a day and carries 2,000 people, who pay £1 for a return ticket.  There are thought to be around 15 working seaside funicular railways left in England. Examples can be found in Bournemouth, Scarborough, Torbay and Hastings."

477,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Barack Obama has accepted the Democratic Party's historic nomination to run for president of the US in front of a crowd of some 75,000 people. In an address at the party's national convention in Denver, he promised he would do his best to keep alive the American dream of opportunity for all. ""America, we are better than these last eight years,"" he told cheering crowds. ""We are a better country than this."" Mr Obama is the first African-American to be nominated by a major US party. In his speech at Denver's Invesco stadium, Mr Obama promised to reverse the economic downturn afflicting the US and restore the nation's standing in the world. I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom    ""We are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight years,"" he said. He also attacked the record of the Bush administration and his Republican rival for the presidency, John McCain. ""This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st Century, the American promise alive."" Mr Obama criticised Mr McCain as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans and said he had failed to help them on issues such as the economy, health care and education. He also stressed that he would call for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, whereas Mr McCain stood ""alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war"", he said. His supporters and those sympathetic to him are breathing a sigh of relief    ""I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, who yearn for a better future,"" he said He rejected criticism by the McCain campaign that he is a ""celebrity"", pointing to his family's past financial hardships, and said his rival should stop questioning his patriotism. In a final rallying call, Mr Obama recalled the message of Martin Luther King, who - 45 years ago to the day - gave his ""I have a dream"" speech in his historic march on Washington. ""America, we cannot turn back,"" he said. ""We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to walk into the future."" Joined on stage by his family and running-mate, Joe Biden, Mr Obama was given a standing ovation by the crowds. Earlier in the day, Mr McCain ran a TV advert in which he congratulated Mr Obama on the historic nature - and date - of his nomination, saying it was ""truly a good day for America"". The political truce was short-lived, however, with a spokesman for the McCain campaign issuing a statement following Mr Obama's address that dismissed his words as ""misleading"". If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden    ""Tonight, Americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of Barack Obama,"" spokesman Tucker Bounds said. ""The fact remains, Barack Obama is still not ready to be president."" The BBC's Justin Webb in Denver says that this needed to be a serious speech by Mr Obama and it was. One feature was that Mr Obama made frequent reference to the future, our correspondent says. The Obama camp knows that Americans are worried about Mr McCain's age and ever so subtly they are making an allusion to it. Martin Luther King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, had earlier told the convention that his father's dream lived on in Mr Obama's candidacy. ""He is in the hopes and dreams, the competence and courage, the rightness and readiness of Barack Obama."" Former Vice-President Al Gore also called on the Democrats to ""seize this opportunity for change"" and elect Mr Obama. Linking Mr McCain firmly to the policies of President George W Bush, Mr Gore said it was vital that Americans changed course if they wanted to tackle a ""self-inflicted economic crisis"", protect the rights of every American and halt global warming. Mr Gore added that the US was ""facing a planetary emergency"" and that the ties of Mr McCain and the Republicans to big oil firms meant they would not act to end the country's reliance on fossil fuels. Mr Gore's address, warmly received by the crowd, followed performances from singers Stevie Wonder, Sheryl Crow and John Legend. The Obama campaign took the unusual move of holding the closing night speeches in the sports stadium to allow ordinary voters, as well as party delegates, to attend. Tens of thousands of people gathered to hear Mr Obama's speech    Mr Obama's much-anticipated appearance was the highlight of the party's carefully choreographed four-day event. Questions remain as to whether Mr Obama can cement his standing within his own party, and reach out to those parts of the electorate that are yet to be convinced by him, the BBC's Matthew Price in Denver notes. He was resoundingly endorsed by ex-President Bill Clinton on Wednesday, which may help consolidate his standing. Earlier that same day, in a moment of high drama, his defeated rival Hillary Clinton cut short a roll-call vote to endorse Mr Obama's candidacy by acclamation, in a powerful gesture of unity. The presidential election on 4 November will pit Mr Obama against Mr McCain, who will be nominated next week at his party's convention in St Paul, Minnesota. Republican officials say Mr McCain has chosen his running-mate, but the person's identity has not yet been announced. Mr McCain is due to hold a 10,000-strong rally in the swing state of Ohio on Friday, at which it was expected he would present his vice-presidential candidate.     "
478,"Six major environmental organisations today added their support to the growing anti-bypass campaign in Newbury, Berkshire.  Friends of the Earth, the Council for British Archaeology, Greenpeace UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Wildlife Trusts and the World Wide Fund for Nature all voiced disapproval of the new road scheme.  In a joint statement they said that a solution to the serious traffic problem was needed but that ""the proposed bypass route is not the answer"".  It said: ""Traffic on the A34 in Newbury will be back to the intolerable levels of today within five to 10 years of the bypass opening.""  Yet supporters of the scheme say the new road will provide essential relief to the congested town centre.  Contractors began work in earnest on the project last week but have since suffered numerous delays and setbacks.  Clearance has been hampered by well-organised activists employing effective disruption tactics.  Protesters have built tunnels and tree houses and are using themselves as human shields to prevent security men and diggers from moving in.  The ensuing conflict over the future of the prime countryside has become known as the 'Third Battle of Newbury' after the two 17th century English Civil War battles that took place in the same area.  Yesterday contractors supplied as many as 300 of their own security guards.  350 trees were felled, and there were 39 arrests.  In a separate development, Thames Valley Police have asked the government to help meet the rising costs of the enterprise.  They fear that policing the protest could cost up to £12 million."
479,"But Volkert van der Graaf - sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment - was also a perfectionist with rigid morals who felt it his duty to protect weaker groups in society.  He saw Fortuyn as a threat to those groups, comparing his rise to that of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.  But he said during the trial that he was now ""struggling"" with the question of whether his act was acceptable.  Volkert van der Graaf is 33, Dutch, white and from the town of Harderwijk, east of Amsterdam.  An interview with Van der Graaf three years ago on the website of the group Animal Freedom - which stresses that he was not a member - reveals a man committed to animal rights from an early age.  At 15 years old, he worked caring for oil-covered birds in Zeeland.  As a student in Wageningen, home to a major university specialising in life sciences and agriculture, he joined an anti-vivisection group.  He was also active with the Inter-University Consultation on Animal Use - an organisation which he said aimed to reduce the use of laboratory animals in education.  At the time of the Animal Freedom interview, Van der Graaf said he worked for Environment Offensive, a group aimed at ""stopping the expansion of factory farming"".  ""Through legal procedures we fight permits for factory farms and fur farms, using the law as our tool,"" the interview reads, fuelling speculation that Van der Graaf had been angered by Mr Fortuyn's stated plan to lift restrictions on fur farming if elected.  Van der Graaf says his parents would not let him give up meat as a teenager, but he later became a vegan.  The text suggests a personal struggle with the ethical issues surrounding the human treatment of animals - ranging from concern for the worms he used while fishing as boy, to whether his diet should exclude ""eco-eggs"".  ""Many animal protectors act from the assumption that 'nature is good',"" he said, ""but every dark side of humans can also be found in nature"".  ""Protecting animals is civilizing people,"" he said.  A man said to be a member of Environment Offensive told Dutch television that Van der Graaf had started out believing that the law was his weapon.  ""Something must have gone wrong, something derailed,"" the activist was quoted as saying, referring to Fortuyn's killing.  On 6 May 2002, just nine days before the Dutch general election, Van der Graaf shot Fortuyn five times at close range as he left a radio studio in the central town of Hilversum.  He was arrested minutes after the shooting, and made a dramatic confession to the court at his first appearance there on 27 March.  The two-and-a-half week trial generated enormous public interest, and was frequently punctuated by vocal contributions from Fortuyn's supporters.  The final reading of the verdict - which fell short of the life sentence demanded by prosecutors - prompted booing and a mass walk-out from the courtroom."
480,"A UK court has ordered evangelical preacher Gilbert Deya back to Kenya to face five counts of child stealing.  The self-proclaimed bishop of a congregation with 36,000 UK members claimed he could give infertile couples 'miracle babies'  It is also unclear how Mr Deya and his wife convinced churchgoers that they were pregnant when they were not and how they believed that they had given birth in backstreet Kenyan clinics.  Kenyan police say Gilbert Deya Ministries is an international child trafficking ring.  A British family court judge agreed, saying infertile couples and congregation members were ""deceived"" by Mr Deya and that he was motivated by ""the most base of human avarices: financial greed"".  Mr Deya regards the children as miracles given to him by God for his followers.  ""The 'miracle babies' which are happening now in our ministry is beyond a human imagination but it's not something that I can say - I can explain because they are of God and things of God cannot be explained by human beings,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Face the Facts programme in 2004.  He denies all charges and plans to appeal against extradition, saying he is the victim of a Kenyan political vendetta.  Kenya sought Mr Deya's return in 2005 after his wife, Mary Deya, and two other women were arrested in Nairobi on child stealing charges.  That followed a raid on the Deya home when 10 children were taken into care.  Mr Deya told British police he was the children's natural father and his 57-year-old wife was their mother - DNA tests proved negative and forged birth certificates were found in his home.  The three women were found guilty and Mr Deya's wife has been sentenced to two years in prison - she is appealing against this.  British and Kenyan officials say vulnerable church members were convinced that Mr Deya had the power of prayer to make them pregnant although they showed no outward signs.  They say he used trickery to convince women they had delivered babies.  A former stonemason who moved to London from Kenya in the mid-90s, Mr Deya developed 14 churches in Britain along with African and Asian branches.  A ministeries advertisement said: ""God has blessed us with miracle babies that the world has never seen anything like before. Your donation is very useful to your miracle.  ""Please send your donation and expect your miracle. Ten pounds, a hundred pounds, a thousand pounds - make cheques payable to Gilbert Deya Ministry"".  Desperate women, some past the menopause and others who were infertile, were convinced that being prayed for by Mr Deya and travelling to Kenya would result in a child.  Once there, they were convinced by Mrs Deya and others that they were in labour and taken to illegal clinics where they underwent what they believed to be childbirth.  In a related case heard in a London family court, a baby was removed from a couple who belonged to Deya Ministries after their local GP alerted authorities when the woman tried to register him. The woman had not been pregnant and returned from a brief stay in Kenya with the child.  Mr Justice Ryder granted custody of the child to Haringey Council and publicly rebuked the church's practices.  ""The funds of his ministry have been generated at least in part by the tithes collected from a congregation that, on the facts I have found, have been deceived by the claims that have been made about Mr and Mrs E's miracle births,"" Mr Justice Ryder said, referring to the couple in that case.  Mr Deya's extradition hearing was told that the women who believed they had given birth had been assaulted in illegal clinics in Nairobi slums.  Kenyan police believe this explains unclear recollections about their 'birth' experience.  Millie Odhiambo-Mabona, executive director of The Cradle, a Kenyan children's rights charity, said no-one is sure where the 'miracle babies' came from.  None of the children taken from the Deya house have been identified.  She believes the women who became convinced they had given birth were simply devout, not wilfully naive.  ""Some believe in the power of witchcraft and those who are Christian believe in the power of God,"" said Mrs Odhiambo-Mabona of the intense level of spirituality in some African countries, including Kenya and Nigeria.  ""They believe Bishop Deya is a serious man of God so if he prays for them and then they have babies for them it is a religious reality."""
481,"Tesco has sold its garden centre chain Dobbies for £217m as the retailer continues with its strategy of focusing on its supermarket business.  Dobbies has been sold to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital.  The sale comes a week after Tesco announced the sale of UK restaurant chain Giraffe and its Turkish business.  Tesco bought Dobbies in 2007 for £150m and it is now the UK's second largest gardening retailer.  Dobbies - which has its headquarters in Lasswade, near Edinburgh - operates 35 garden centres in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.  Tesco said that the business contributed £17m to its annual profits last year.  Tesco has embarked on an asset sale programme in recent months, disposing of what it considers to be non-core parts of its business.  In addition to the recent sale of the Giraffe chain and Kipa, Tesco sold its South Korean business, Homeplus, last September for £4.2bn.  The sales are part of attempts by Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis to revive the retail giant's fortunes.  Announcing the sale of the garden centre business, Mr Lewis said: ""Through their hard work and dedication to customer service Dobbies colleagues have built a great business and I would like to thank them for everything they have done.  ""It was a difficult decision to sell the business but we believe this agreement will give Dobbies a bright future while allowing our UK retail business to focus on its core strengths."""
482,"Train companies must stop dumping human waste from toilets on railway tracks, a transport minister has said.  Lady Kramer branded the practice ""utterly disgusting"" and called on the industry to take action.  The RMT rail union is also demanding action, saying it is a potential health hazard for track workers.  The train companies said carriages without toilet tanks were being phased out and it was not often an issue raised by passengers or workers.  Modern trains are fitted with toilet tanks, which are pumped out at the depot when they become full.  But older rolling stock, which is still running on many of Britain's busiest routes, still discharges sewage directly on to the track.  Former Conservative minister Baroness Wilcox raised the issue as the House of Lords debated the 20th anniversary of rail privatisation.  ""I am very sorry to see that still we have raw sewage going out on to the lines,"" she told peers.  ""It is a terrible thing to see after all these years since November 5, 1993 that we should still be doing that.""  She asked Lady Kramer: ""Before we rush forward to HS2, which I am looking forward to enormously, I would like to urge you to think about the men working on the lines and working in the stations who are having to deal with this excrement.""  The Lib Dem minister replied: ""The comments you make totally resonate. This is just utterly disgusting and I think it does speak to the fact that customer service has not always been at the centre of railways because customers I think are very concerned about this issue.""  She said InterCity 125 trains would be replaced from 2017 by new models which would solve the problem.  But she added: ""It is a tougher issue on the local diesel trains which are gradually going out of service and we could indeed use some help from the industry in trying to tackle that problem.""  The RMT rail union claims parts of the rail network, such as stretches of the the East Coast Mainline, are ""like an open sewer"" and it was a frequent source of complaints from workers.  RMT General Secretary Bob Crow said: ""It really is a shocking indictment on the state of our railways 20 years after privatisation, and with hundreds of millions of pounds a year being creamed off in private profits, that raw sewage is still being dumped on the tracks up and down the UK.  ""Not only is it a filthy way of disposing of effluent, but it also poses real health risks and dangers for RMT members out there working on the tracks.  ""It should be stopped and the train companies should be the ones who pay the price for upgrading the trains and employing staff to empty the tanks.""  The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train companies and Network Rail, said the issue did not come up in a bi-annual national passenger survey and it was not often raised as an issue by staff.  A spokesperson said: ""The majority of rail carriages that have toilets are fitted with tanks and the number of older carriages which are not will fall further in the next few years as new InterCity trains are introduced.  ""The industry is always listening to customers and has spent millions of pounds on installing and improving passenger toilet facilities.  ""Train companies and Network Rail also take their duty of care towards staff very seriously and ensure that depot and trackside teams are given the right training, equipment and protective clothing for their roles."""
483,"About one in 1,000 Europeans and Americans have a resistance to HIV Doctors in Germany say a patient appears to have been cured of HIV by a bone marrow transplant from a donor who had a genetic resistance to the virus. The researchers in Berlin said the man, who suffered from leukaemia and HIV, had shown no sign of either disease since the transplant two years ago. But they stressed it was an unusual case which needed further investigation. Experts said the result may boost interest in gene therapy for HIV. Berlin's Charite clinic said the 42-year-old patient was an American living in Berlin, but the man has not been identified. He had been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, that causes Aids, for more than a decade and also had leukaemia. The clinic said since the transplant was carried out 20 months ago, tests on the patient's bone marrow, blood and other organ tissues have all been clear. To promise to millions of people infected with HIV that there is hope of a cure would not be right    In a statement, Professor Rodolf Tauber from the Charite clinic said: ""This is an interesting case for research. ""But to promise to millions of people infected with HIV that there is hope of a cure would not be right."" Roughly one in 1,000 Europeans and Americans have an inherited genetic mutation, which prevents HIV from attaching itself to cells. Two million people die of Aids every year and HIV is estimated to have infected 33 million people worldwide. Professor Andrew Sewell, from the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Immunology at the University of Cardiff said in theory a bone marrow transplant such as this one ""should work"" and it was surprising that no one had tried it before. Most people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa and this is hugely expensive    ""The problem is most people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa and this is hugely expensive, you have to find a matched donor, and it's a pretty severe and painful operation. ""So it's going to be an option for very few people."" He added that gene therapy to knock out the mutation of the key CCR5 receptor was a possibility for future treatment. Professor Philip Goulder, an immunologist at the University of Oxford said: ""It's a really interesting case which looks at a treatment which really hasn't been thought about before. ""But without having that much information about the specific case you would want to be very cautious about getting too excited and you wouldn't be able to replicate that treatment for a lot of people with HIV."" Paul Ward, deputy chief executive at the Terrence Higgins Trust said: ""This case gives us something to explore in future studies but it's certainly not a quick fix as gene therapy is complex and expensive. ""With no cure in sight, prevention should be our number one priority.""     "
484,"Correspondents reported scenes of excitement and confusion as the first residents went through the Ledra Palace checkpoint in the centre of Nicosia.  The Turkish Cypriots announced on Monday that they were easing the restrictions to build confidence between the divided communities.  Some of those crossing the green line were keen to show their children the sights of the southern part of Nicosia for the first time.  ""I'm going to get a Cypriot passport so I can get a job in Europe,"" said one young Turkish Cypriot man before running off to present his ID card to the Greek Cypriot police.  One woman carried candles, hoping to light them in what had once been her local church, in celebration of Orthodox Easter this Sunday.  By lunchtime more than 350 Turkish Cypriots and 140 Greek Cypriots had crossed the line. All must return by the end of the day.  The Greek Cypriot Government has given a cautious welcome to the decision, but said it had been designed to deflect attention from the Turkish Cypriots' ""negative attitude"" to the peace process.  ""The wall hasn't fallen,"" said a spokesman, in a reference to the end of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  The island has been divided since Turkish troops invaded the north in 1974, following a brief Greek-Cypriot coup backed by the Greek Government.  Thousands of people displaced from their homes have never returned, and earlier this year a high-profile peace push by the United Nations ended in failure.  But while these steps will clearly go some way to ease the tension and the economic imbalance between the two communities, there are no signs that the key political issues of territory and sovereignty are any closer to being resolved, says the BBC's Tabitha Morgan in Cyprus.  The easing of border restrictions comes a week after the Greek Cypriots signed the European Union accession treaty paving the way for EU membership next year.  But EU membership will, in effect, apply only in the internationally-recognised Greek part of Cyprus if the island is not unified in time for formal membership in May 2004.  Serdar Denktash, the deputy Turkish Cypriot prime minister and son of the president, said the easing of restrictions would be a test of whether the two sides could live together.  ""This is a unilateral decision passed to build confidence and promote peace,"" he said.  Greek Cypriots have announced a series of proposals to allow trade between the two sides and to enable Turkish Cypriots to work in Greek part of the island.  The green line is manned by UN peacekeepers."
485,"Premiership football is attracting an increasing number of high-earning fans, according to the annual benchmark survey of the British game. The Sir Norman Chester Centre for Football Research at Leicester University confirms many supporters' perceptions about the changing face of football. Percentage of fans born with 20 miles of club's ground: 70% The centre's annual report questioned 26,000 English Premiership supporters plus 3,000 Celtic and Rangers fans. It found a sport whose fans are willing to pay large sums but are also concerned about price rises. Supporters are increasingly like to be women or children, while the 45% with access to the internet is higher than the national average. And despite their image as the epitome of the modern Premiership club, Manchester United's Old Trafford ground was voted as the worst to visit. The survey discovered that 11% of fans earn more than £50,000 a year, although there is a major north/south divide. Wealthy west Londoners Chelsea have the highest percentage of big earners - 33% of Stamford Bridge season ticket holders make over £50,000 a year The comparative figure is only 4% at Sunderland and less than 10% at most northern and Midlands clubs Chelsea fans also have the highest total football-related spend - £1,746 Of current Premiership clubs, Southampton fans spend the least - just £714 a year The rising price of attending games also continues to concern fans, but those attending games still believe they get value for money. 64% of respondents said high ticket prices are now the most serious problem facing the game Chelsea again topped the chart, charging an average of £666 for a season ticket last season The lowest figures was £315 at Everton 59% said football still offers reasonable value for money 25% said it gave good value The report also confirmed the changing make-up of crowds. Women and children are attending top-flight matches in greater numbers as the sport continues to nurture a ""family"" image. At Middlesbrough and Derby, female fans buy 20% of season tickets 80% of those questioned regularly take children to games A third of fans had seen racism at games, while many supporters from ethnic minorities remain reluctant to attend games. 1.6% of the fans surveyed said they came from ""another UK or foreign background"" Arsenal have the most - 2.5%, followed by other London clubs Just over 30% said they had witnessed racism towards players from other supporters The survey found that half of fans were happy with ground improvement although a quarter wanted to return to standing areas. But when it comes to facilities, fans say it is the Premiership's biggest and most successful club which has got it wrong. Man Utd's giant Old Trafford ground was worst ground to visit, followed by fellow ""big clubs"" Leeds and Chelsea Liverpool's Anfield is the number one venue Interesting answers to the oldest question in football - why fans support a particular club - also feature in the survey. Manchester United have the fewest locally-born fans - just 46% of their season ticket holders The three north-eastern clubs - Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough - have most, alongside Everton and Aston Villa - all with more than 80% Despite the view that a club is for life, 9% admit to having transferred their allegiance"
486,"The Territorial Army would be renamed the Army Reserve under plans unveiled by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.  He told the BBC legislation would be needed for the change, which would also see territorials get regular Army kit, and train with full-time forces.  As part of the recent defence review, the numbers of regular soldiers is set to fall from 102,000 to 82,000, while reservists will double to 30,000.  He said the reservists would become an ""integral part"" of the Army.  Mr Hammond said he hoped that a number of those leaving the slimmed down regular forces would join the reserves and ""help change the ethos"".  Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if he was attempting to get an ""army on the cheap"", Mr Hammond said cutting the size of the regular army was ""unfortunately one of the steps we had to take to rebalance the defence budget"".  He said that it made sense for many of the support functions, like logistics, to be done by reservists because there was not such a great demand for them during peacetime.  The defence secretary said he wanted to see a name change - ""in my head they are the Army Reserve, an integral part of the regular Army"" - but added that the change would need to be approved by Parliament.  TA soldiers usually have full-time or part-time jobs and attend training sessions in their own free time. They are paid about £35 a day for each session.  They have to commit to between 19 and 27 training days a year and if they meet this commitment they get a tax-free lump sum called a bounty, which ranges from £424 to £2,098.  Travel to and from their units is also subsidised and they do not have to pay towards their kit.  Britain has had a reserve of part-time or retired soldiers - often known as yeomanry - since the Middle Ages but the system was only regularised in 1907 with the passing of legislation creating a Territorial Force.  It was mobilised just before World War I and its soldiers fought alongside regular soldiers in the trenches of northern France.  In 1920 it became the Territorial Army and in 1939 it was doubled in size as war clouds approached again.  The TA withered away during the 1960s but in 1971 it was reformed and expanded although its role remained unclear until the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.  As the regular Army became increasingly stretched in the early 21st century the TA became more important and 6,900 TA soldiers were mobilised for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  In recent years it has also supported regular troops in Afghanistan and the Balkans."
487,"Paula Radcliffe's crowning as BBC Sports Personality of the Year is a fitting finale to what has been a staggering year. In the space of 12 months, Radcliffe transformed herself from also-ran to how-did-she-run-that? Radcliffe became new marathon world record holder, European 10,000m champion, Commonwealth 5,000m champion, winner of the London Marathon at her first attempt, world cross country champion - the list goes on. This is a woman who was determined to break the old British stereotype of a plucky loser, the nice person who finishes just out of the medals. She was fed up of of jokes about her nodding head and had enough of glorious failures - and she proved herself in brilliant fashion. Off the track, Radcliffe is as pleasant an individual as you could hope to meet, popular with both the national media and her fellow athletes. She is intelligent enough to be fluent in both French and Italian and translate the IAAF magazine into English to keep up her language skills. But her relaxed manner hides a steely determination which has made her as ruthless a sportswoman as Britain has produced. Born 28 years ago to a brewery executive father and a headmistress mother, Radcliffe started running aged seven, accompanying her father for the odd mile as he trained for marathons. Aged nine she joined Bedford Athletics Club and met the man who is still her coach, Alex Stanton. In her first national race, as a schoolgirl, she finished 299th. So how did she become the world's best distance runner? In the main, through unbelievable hard work and a unshakeable belief that it would come right if she kept at it. Radcliffe, unlike some of her rivals, is clean. But her high-profile stance against drugs has won her as many enemies as admirers. All year there have been sniping comments that her new-found success must have been down to doping. The jibes came despite Radcliffe asking to be tested before and after every race and actually being tested more often than any other British athlete. Her husband and manager Gary Lough also acts as her minder, for she admits there is a serious chance someone could try to doctor her water bottles. Next year she will attempt to add the world 10,000m gold to her trophy cabinet, and after that comes the really big one - a likely joust at the Olympic marathon title in Greece. But for now, she can sit back and allow herself a small smile of satisfaction at a wonderful 2002."
488,"In the deciding frame, O'Sullivan missed a key blue with the rest to let the Scot steal it at the death.  The enthralling match saw Maguire open up a 3-1 lead at the interval with breaks of 103 and 84.  O'Sullivan, who beat Maguire 10-2 in the UK Championship final, levelled at 5-5 before the dramatic finale.  The match pitted provisional world number one O'Sullivan against the provisional world number two, and it lived up to expectations with some nail-biting moments and high-quality shots.  Maguire made a strong start, and a miraculous escape from a horrible snooker helped him to take the opener before O'Sullivan levelled with a 68 in the next.  Breaks of 103 and 84 took Maguire 3-1 ahead, and he went further clear by winning the scrappy fifth frame but he seemed less assured after the break.  O'Sullivan showed his class with runs of 103 and 72 before Maguire stopped the rot with another frame.  More pressure came Maguire's way as the defending champion made runs of 66 and 64 to force a decider, but O'Sullivan failed to make a winning position count with the crucial missed blue.  O'Sullivan was philosophical about the result, saying he would quickly forget about the match.  ""I had my chance and I didn't take it,"" said O'Sullivan.  ""If you don't take your chances then don't expect another one.  ""You just have to put these results behind you. In 10 years' time will this match have much significance in what I've done in my career? I don't think so.""  Maguire said he had resigned himself to defeat in the final frame.  ""At 4-1 up I was feeling brilliant and I felt as though I didn't fancy missing if I split the pack, I was confident I could clear up at one visit,"" he said.  ""But he's made a 100 break to come back to 4-2 and I was thinking 'what have I got to do to beat this guy?'  ""I was never in doubt he was going to clear up. I was 100% sure he was going to clear up.  ""I was actually thinking 'what am I going to do tonight now that I'm out?'""  Earlier, former world champion Shaun Murphy shrugged off a slow start to seal a 6-3 win over Ali Carter in the opening match of the tournament.  Carter took the opening two frames before a break of 66 in the third got Murphy into the swing of things.  Murphy levelled the scoreline, but a 77 edged Carter back in front.  But with neither player finding top gear, Murphy proved better at grinding out the remaining frames as Carter's frustration got the better of him.  Murphy admitted he had not hit his best form, but said he had been short of practice time because of illness.  ""I'm very pleased about my game considering I had not practised over Christmas because I was ill,"" said Murphy.  ""I was going to the toilet every 20 minutes. I'm still not well and Ali was poorly during the match too.""  In the final match of the day, Wales' Ryan Day provided the quality in a low-key wildcard round victory over a misfiring Barry Hawkins.  Day raced into a 3-0 lead as Hawkins spurned a series of opportunities, although the Englishman did pull one frame back before the interval.  The fifth frame saw Day in with a chance of a 147 maximum break, but he broke down on 113.  Hawkins took a scrappy sixth, but that was as good as it got as Day made breaks of 55 and 120 to seal a 6-2 win."
489,"Bradford City pulled off one of the great League Cup shocks with a penalty shoot-out victory over Arsenal in front of an ecstatic home crowd.  The League Two side prevailed 3-2 on spot-kicks, to the delight of a capacity Coral Windows Stadium.  Gunners skipper Thomas Vermaelen missed the crucial penalty on a difficult night for the Premier League side, who have won only once in the last six matches in all competitions.  Garry Thompson volleyed the hosts ahead, before Vermaelen headed home a Santi Cazorla cross at the back post with with only two minutes remaining of normal time.  Defeat is another setback in a disappointing domestic season so far for manager Arsene Wenger and his club, who last won a major title in 2005.  Victory for the Bantams means they have now won their last nine penalty shoot-outs and are the first team from the bottom tier of English football to reach the semi-final of the competition since Wycombe in 2006-07.  Wenger had shown his intent with a starting XI that included just three changes from the side that beat West Brom on Saturday and 10 from the one that began the epic 7-5 win over Reading in the last round. French midfielder Francis Coquelin was the only survivor from that game.  The last time the teams met was in the Premier League in January 2001, but they started Tuesday's game 65 places apart in the league pyramid.  Arsenal had the better of the opening exchanges, and both Vermaelen and Lukas Podolski spurned presentable headed opportunities.  ""From Bradford's point of view it has been a magnificent effort. ""They made Arsenal hurry in every single department and played excellent football themselves. ""Arsenal's internationals came on and eventually got the equaliser, but this was such a fantastic effort from City. ""There is such a big gap between these two sides. They made Arsenal look extremely ordinary.""  They were left to rue their wastefulness when Vermaelen brought down the lively Nahki Wells and Thompson volleyed home the resulting Gary Jones free-kick from close range to spark jubilation amongst nearly 24,000 supporters in the packed-out home stands.  Coquelin came close to an equaliser for the two-time champions when his low volley beat Bantams keeper Matt Duke but not the post, before Gervinho managed to totally miss the ball when presented with an open goal from Gibbs's low centre.  But the first half belonged to Bradford, who have not lost a Cup game since a 4-2 defeat by Watford in the FA Cup third round in January. Wells nearly doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time but his low half-volley trickled just wide.  The second half started in a scrappy fashion, with the hosts continuing to frustrate Arsenal with their energetic display.  The top-flight side dominated possession, but passing errors and a lack of cutting edge continued to plague their game.  Just when it looked like the team from the fourth tier were going to make the semi-final for the first time in their history, Vermaelen headed in a pinpoint cross from Cazorla to send the game into an extra 30 minutes.  Neither side could find a winner so it was down to penalties and successful efforts from Nathan Doyle, Gary Jones and Alan Connell allied to misses from Cazorla, Chamakh and Vermaelen gave the Bantams a famous win.  The draw for the semi-finals takes place straight after the Leeds v Chelsea quarter-final on Wednesday, 19 December. Along with Bradford, Aston Villa are already in the draw, with Swansea taking on Middlesbrough in the other quarter-final.

490,"Drinks manufacturer Britvic is planning to move its UK head office out of Essex by the middle of 2012.  The Chelmsford-based company said it was looking to leave its Broomfield Road site for premises with better travel links for its UK employees.  The firm behind Robinsons, Tango, and J2O is considering locations around the junctions of the M25 and M1.  The company said its production factory at the town's Widford Industrial Estate will be unaffected by the move.  About 280 employees currently use the offices in Broomfield Road.  The company said it would try to make the move for them as ""easy as possible"".  A spokesperson said: ""Chelmsford has played an important part in the history of Britvic and we will continue to maintain a significant presence in the town with our production site and offices in Widford.""  ""However, the growth of our GB and international businesses requires us to establish a new head office that is more central to all our operations.""  The company has been synonymous with Chelmsford since a chemist in Tindall Street began selling vitamin and tonic drinks to its customers in the mid-19th Century."
491,"Schumacher recovered from a last-place starting position on the grid following a stall to power his way up to third in the final, championship-deciding grand prix of the 1998 season.  Savouring his victory, Hakkinen said: ""When Michael was forced to start from the back of the grid it raised an enormous amount of pressure from me.  ""The race was not as difficult as others I've had this season. But a lot of that's down to the team who kept letting me know where Eddie and Michael were.""  ""When Michael went to the back I knew it was up to me. I made a fantastic start and got close to Mika at some points but just couldn't manage to get in front.""  It is the first time in seven years that McLaren has won the drivers' championship.  The tension rose before the race began with a false start by Jarno Trulli in the Prost Peugeot, which sent him to the back of the line up and shortened the race by one lap.  The Ferrari had nudged forward by a couple of inches and stalled as the German put it into gear.  Schumacher acknowledged the mistake, which gave him a mountainous 20 cars to overtake, with only the tiniest shake of his head.  The final race of the 1998 season eventually got under way after being reduced from 53 to 51 laps.  The initial sparring saw the second Ferrari of Eddie Irvine race into second from third, behind Hakkinen, the leader.  But he found himself stuck behind two-time Suzuka winner Damon Hill in the Jordan, and the subsequent battle put nearly 30 seconds between the German challenger and Hakkinen before he could move up to fifth.  The Monaco-based driver, whose racing career was in doubt after an horrific crash in Australia in 1995, managed to squeeze a hand out of the cockpit to acknowledge his eighth grand prix victory of the season.  Damon Hill finished a clinical race by grabbing fourth at the final corner to give the Jordan team fourth - their highest ranking in the constructors' championship.  Williams finished a disappointing season with Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jacques Villeneuve in fifth and sixth respectively.  McLaren also took the constructors' championship for the eighth time in its history.  British driver Johnny Herbert came in 10th in his final ride for Sauber before driving for Stewart next year.  The 1999 season begins in Melbourne on 7 March."
492,"US pharmaceutical giant Merck has announced it will cut 8,500 further jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015.  The company's shares rose 2.35% to $48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts.  The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.  Merck said it will be shifting its focus to areas it sees as high growth, such as cancer treatment.  It is also pulling products in late-stage trials it estimates will not be so successful, and licensing other products to alternative companies.  The New Jersey-based company anticipates its costs will be reduced by $1bn at the end of 2014, from cutting marketing, administrative, research and development operations.  Kenneth Frazier, chief executive at Merck, said: ""While these actions are essential to ensure that Merck can continue to fulfil its mission into the future, they are nevertheless difficult decisions because they affect our dedicated and talented colleagues.  ""We appreciate the contributions of all our employees, and we will support them during this time of transformation.""  Merck will also be selling property in New Jersey to help save costs.  Alex Arfaei, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said he was concerned Merck was putting too much faith in a handful of experimental drugs.  He said these include a new type of cancer drug that boosts the immune system, a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, improved versions of its cervical cancer vaccine and its treatment for hepatitis C.  ""Overall, today's announcement makes us more cautious about the potential of Merck's pipeline"" of experimental drugs, Mr Arfaei said."
493,"Local scientists say it's now so badly damaged that another hurricane would simply sweep it away.  But they don't primarily blame hurricanes for the damage to the coral here on the Belize Barrier Reef; they blame climate change.  And they are backing a petition pressing the United Nations World Heritage Sites Committee to acknowledge that climate change is already damaging world heritage sites.  The five sites are the Belize Barrier reef, at 321km (200 miles) long, the biggest in the western hemisphere; the Australian barrier reef; and glacier parks in Nepal, Peru and the Rockies where glaciers are disappearing as the climate warms.  The World Heritage Sites Treaty stipulates that listed sites should not be damaged by signatories to the treaty, but it was mainly designed to protect the world's treasures in the event of wars.  The stakes are high because if the UN accepts the case, it might lead to poor countries attempting to sue rich countries for damages for the greenhouse gases they've emitted.  Scientists in Belize believe their case is strong. They say the 297km (185 mile) reef here has suffered more than 40% damage since 1998.  They particularly implicate three events of coral bleaching when water temperatures were high.  Corals get their colour from tiny single-cell plants - zooxanthellae - which provide for the reef-building creatures, the polyps.  When temperatures are very high for a protracted period, the zooxanthellae are driven away, the coral loses its colour, the polyps lose their food and so the reef is weakened.  The reefs then easily fall victim to the many forces that assail them - over-fishing, pollution, creatures that eat them, tourist snorkellers who inadvertently smother them with sand, and particularly the storm waves of hurricanes.  Local fishermen say there is no record of bleaching before 1998.  Billy Leslie, who runs the Hustler Dive School in San Pedro in northern Belize, said: ""My father was a commercial fisherman. He tells me that we have never heard of coral bleaching like this. It's a horrible sight to see; the coral just gets whiter and whiter every day.""  Richard Foster, a wildlife cameraman, said: ""I first started diving here in the early 80s and you just won't believe the difference with today. The corals were so thick they were competing with each other on the bottom. There was no space between the corals.  Dr Melanie McField, from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, US, has been studying the reefs for more than a decade.  She is confident that climate change is a key factor: ""On an annual basis, the sea temperatures in the Caribbean haven't changed much, but we are now registering prolonged periods of severe heating that we didn't see before.  ""When the water temperature is elevated we get a bleaching alert - and this coincides pretty accurately with the bleaching events.  ""The other big sign that the water temperatures are to blame rather than local pollution is that the bleaching episodes happen all over the Caribbean at the same time.""  Dr McField is angry that Belize has been working hard to protect its reefs but is suffering from a problem beyond its control.  She is also concerned about another major fear for the future of the corals - ocean acidification.  The Royal Society, the UK's academy of science, argued last year that so much CO2 from fossil-fuel burning was being absorbed into the oceans that surface waters were becoming acidified.  Research in Plymouth and Jerusalem shows that many species of corals are easily damaged by even a slight lowering of pH.  A small minority of coral researchers believe that fears over climate change and acidification have been exaggerated.  They argue that over time the reefs will adapt to warmer waters and that calcium littering the ocean floors will buffer the effects of acidification.  Dr McField accepts that reefs might eventually adapt but says this could take thousands of years.  In the meantime countries making money from reefs would suffer huge economic damage, she says.  Miguel Alamilla, who runs a marine protected area off the town of San Pedro, has a message for the big nations emitting greenhouse gases.  ""They need to open up and don't be egoistic but think globally,"" he said. ""Be aware that people are dependent on the coral reef and their livelihoods depend on that.  ""If it is destroyed what will happen to them?""  The UN campaigners believe these are powerful arguments in their favour.  They will face, though, determined resistance on the World Heritage Committee from the US. Objections to the petition include:"
494,"Every year in November, burning barrels are rolled through the streets of Ottery St Mary, with some even carried on people's backs.  Past events have raised thousands of pounds for charity.  Organisers have not been able to obtain insurance this time because of a claim made after last year's event.  With the claim being processed, the normal insurers will no longer provide public liability insurance which is needed should anything happen to an individual.  Ottery carnival president Andy Wade, who heads the organising committee, said it was the first time he could remember a claim being made.  He said they would continue to search for alternative ways of obtaining the correct insurance for the 4 November event.  ""It would be most unfortunate if it could not go ahead. I am convinced there is an answer out there somewhere,"" he said.  The event was nearly cancelled in 2003 after insurers also pulled out.  The tradition is believed to have originated from pagan rituals to ward off evil spirits."
495,"EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has called for the EU to evolve into a ""federation of nation-states"".  Addressing the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Barroso said such a move was necessary to combat the continent's economic crisis.  He said he believed Greece would be able to stay in the eurozone if it stood by its commitments.  Mr Barroso also set out plans for a single supervisory mechanism for all banks in the eurozone.  He called the plans a ""quantum leap... the stepping stone to the banking union"".  The European Central Bank would get much greater powers of oversight and regulation of Europe's 6,000 banks under the plan.  Mr Barroso said said eurozone countries should not rely on bailouts from the ECB, saying the bank ""cannot and will not finance governments"".  ""But when monetary policy channels are not working properly, the Commission believes that it is within the mandate of the ECB to take the necessary actions - for instance, in the secondary markets of sovereign debt,"" he added.  With respect to Greece, Mr Barroso said he believed the eurozone had reached a ""turning point"".  This was a very federalist speech. Mr Barroso made it clear that the creation of a single banking supervisor, and moves towards full banking union, are just a first step. He wants the EU to become a federation of nation states. No-one will be forced to come in, he said, but the speed should not be dictated by the slowest or the most reluctant. Before the next European elections in 2014, the European Commission intends to put forward explicit ideas on how to change EU treaties to reflect moves towards closer political union. There will be huge arguments ahead - there are big differences within the Eurozone about the pace of political change. But countries like the UK, which don't want to take part in any further integration, are going to have to work out how best to protect their interests as other EU member states pool more of their sovereignty.  ""If Greece banishes all doubt about its commitment to reform, but also if all the other countries banish all doubts about their determination to keep Greece in the euro area, we can do it,"" he said to applause from MEPs.  Mr Barroso said he was not calling for a ""superstate"", but rather ""a democratic federation of nation states that can tackle our common problems, through the sharing of sovereignty"".  ""Creating this federation... will ultimately require a new treaty,"" Mr Barroso said.  The inability of governments thus far to respond effectively to economic developments was ""fuelling populism and extremism in Europe and also elsewhere"", he added.  The banking union would be a big first step in the creation of closer union within the eurozone, the BBC's Chris Morris in Strasbourg reports.  There will be opposition to the plans - the German government, for example, says far fewer banks should be involved, our correspondent says.  Britain does not want to take part but supports the idea of a single supervisor for the eurozone, as long as it does not affect the integrity of the wider EU single market, he adds.  Last week Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner in charge of financial regulation, said he hoped such a scheme could be set up by early 2013."
496,"Weaver, 28, signed a three-year deal after 10 years at City - during which he made more than 200 appearances.  Striker Todorov, also 28, fell down the pecking order at Portsmouth last season and has signed a one-year deal.  ""They're two proven Premiership players who are now Championship players,"" boss Alan Pardew told Charlton's website.  ""Nicky hasn't had the breaks in his career that he has deserved, but this is a great opportunity for him while Svetoslav's quality and precision, which is proven in this division, will be very important to us, especially in home games.""  The duo have become Pardew's seventh and eighth signings of the summer.  Todorov said he was confident of making a positive impact at The Valley.  ""Leaving Portsmouth was a big decision for me but I'm looking forward to playing for Charlton,"" he said.  ""I like the way Alan Pardew's teams play. I saw his teams at Reading and at West Ham and liked their style."""
497,"The idea was suggested to police by Rabbi Eliezer Fisher.  The newspaper Maariv said rabbinical authorities had sanctioned the plan to use the product - considered impure by Jews and Muslims - if it might save lives.  Police had no immediate comment on the proposal, according to Reuters news agency.  Israeli Deputy Defence Minister Yaacov Edri said he supported the proposal.  ""If bags of pig lard will prevent zealous Muslim terrorists from carrying out attacks, I'm all for it,"" Maariv quoted him as saying."
498,"The son of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was fined the equivalent of US$500,000 (£265,000) and given a four-year suspended jail term.  Sir Mark, who denies any knowledge of the plot, agreed a plea bargain and will now co-operate with investigators.  He left Cape Town on a flight to London's Heathrow on Thursday evening.  Sir Mark admitted breaking anti-mercenary legislation in South Africa by agreeing to finance a helicopter.  The businessman said he did not initially know the helicopter's alleged purpose - that it was to be used in the alleged coup attempt, instead believing it was to be used as an air ambulance.  But in his plea bargain statement, Sir Mark says he came to realise the helicopter was to be used for mercenary activities before the deal was finalised.  Speaking outside court, an emotional Sir Mark said: ""There is no price too high for me to pay to be reunited with my family and I am sure all of you who are husbands and fathers would agree with that.""  ""I know that what matters to Mark now is to be reunited with Diane and the children as soon as possible.""  Her son is now leaving South Africa for the first time in five months.  An advisor to Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that: ""We are confident that justice has been done,"" implying that they would no longer seek Sir Mark's extradition.  The BBC's Alastair Leithead said it seemed Sir Mark could now turn ""state witness"" as part of his co-operation with the South African authorities.  If Sir Mark had been unable to pay the three million rand fine, he would have incurred a five-year prison sentence, with his four-year suspended sentence on top of that.  Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean lawyer for a close friend of Sir Mark accused of leading the alleged coup plot, former SAS officer Simon Mann, says that his jail term has been reduced from seven years to four by a court in Harare.  Mann was last year found guilty of illegally buying weapons in Zimbabwe, which were allegedly intended to be used in the Equatorial Guinea coup plot.  A further 14 men were found guilty in Equatorial Guinea of being involved in the alleged plot to overthrow President Nguema, who has ruled Africa's third-largest oil producer for the past 25 years.  Nick du Toit was jailed for 34 years, while opposition leader Severo Moto, who is in exile in Spain, was given 63 years in absentia.  Both men escaped the death penalty demanded by the prosecution.  Sir Mark, 51, was arrested in August at his home in South Africa and released on bail.  News of Thursday's hearing in Cape Town came as a surprise. The defendant was not expected back in court until 18 February.  After his plea, his lawyers released a statement saying: ""It should be noted that Sir Mark was not charged with any involvement in the attempted coup d'etat in Equatorial Guinea.  ""The plea bargain was entered into solely as a result of his financing of the charter of a helicopter in circumstances where he should have exercised more caution.""  Sipho Ngwema, a spokesman for South Africa's Directorate of Special Investigations, also known as the Scorpions, said Sir Mark had promised to co-operate with South African investigators."
499,"An overview of the plan for the 2012 Olympics in London. On 15 March 2007 the government announced the budget for the Games had risen from £2.4bn to £9.35bn, although she said the cost of the Games would be £5.3bn. New venues will cost £3.1bn. These include the Olympic Park at Stratford and the athletes' village. There will be £1.7bn spent on regeneration and infrastructure. £600m will be spent on extra security. The government has set aside £2.7bn in a contingency fund in case costs rise further. The Olympics will have to pay an £840m tax bill. £390m will be spent on other costs, such as the Paralympics and community sport. Income: The government will provide £6bn, with other funds coming from London council tax payers and the National Lottery. Further income will come from International Olympic Committee TV and marketing deals (£560m); sponsorship and official suppliers (£450m); ticket revenues (£300m); licensing (£60m); London Development Agency (£250m) There will be 9.6 million tickets for sale - 8 million for the Olympics and 1.6 million for the Paralympics. Organisers say 75% of all tickets will cost less than £50 and offer free travel on London transport. A sell-out rate of 82% for the Olympic Games and 63% for the Paralympics is estimated. Tickets for the athletics will start at £15 and there will be 20,000 £10 tickets for the Olympic Park to watch events on big screens. An aerial view of London's planned Olympic Park for 2012    Olympic Village   The village will have 17,320 beds and provide each athlete with 16 square metres' floor space. Each apartment will have a TV, internet access, a private courtyard. The dining hall will cater for 5,500 athletes at a time. The Olympic Village Polyclinic will be converted into a lifelong learning centre for the east London community, with a nursery, primary and secondary schools. The village will be converted into 3,600 apartments. Most of them will be affordable housing. The media and press centre would become a creative industries centre for east London. After the Games four arenas would be 'deconstructed' and relocated to other parts of the UK along with the swimming pools that are used for water polo and the 50m training pools. Charities will be given the sports equipment used in the Games for free. Tessa Jowell will be Olympics Minister, responsible for delivering the Games. Government will create an Olympic Delivery Authority to ensure delivery of Olympic infrastructure and new venues. There will also be a Cabinet-level Olympic Security Committee to co-ordinate all security planning. 80% of athletes would be within 20 minutes of their events and 97% of athletes within 30 minutes of their events. 93% of training venues are to be within 30 minutes of the athletes village. The aim is for 90% of venues to be served by three or more forms of public transport. There will be two major park and ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars, within 25 minutes of the Olympic Park. There are 9,000 planned park and ride spaces to be made available at Ebbsfleet where spectators can board a 10-minute shuttle service to the Olympic Park. This is the same station where continental spectators travelling by Eurostar will join the shuttle to the Olympic Park. It is predicted that on event days 78% of spectators are likely to travel from within London and 22% from the rest of the UK and Europe. Organisers estimate 80% of visitors and staff of the Games will use rail services to reach the Olympic Park. Low or no-emission vehicles will be used to transport Olympic athletes and officials. A tri-generation plant will supply electricity, heat and chilled water to the Olympic Park using technology which produces 33% lower CO2 emissions than from the electricity grid. By 2012 it is estimated that over 135,000 hotel rooms will be available within 50km of the Olympic Park, up from 120,000 presently. According to London 2012, for the first time in any Games live Olympic backdrop presentation facilities will be available to broadcast rights holders via rooftop studios on the main press centre with a direct view of the Olympic Stadium and Park.

500,"An Old Bailey jury took just an hour to clear Neil Horan, 57, from Nunhead, south London.  He then performed an Irish jig in his Irish national costume outside the court in celebration.  Mr Horan, who disrupted the men's Olympic marathon this year, denied exposing himself to the girl in his bedsit in 1991.  He has not worked in a church for 10 years but stages stunts to publicise his beliefs about the second coming and the end of the world.  He stepped in front of the leader in the men's Olympic marathon race, possibly costing him the gold medal.  And last year he was jailed for two months for disrupting the British Grand Prix race at Silverstone by running on to the track in front of speeding cars.  Mr Horan agreed he was naked but denied getting the child to touch him.  During his defence, Mr Horan broke down after calling on God to ""strike me down"" if he was lying.  After being cleared, he said: ""It is the happiest day of my life.  ""As for the women who accused me, I wish them well.  ""But there is a lesson to be learned for other priests, who should be careful not to get too close to women they deal with.""  Horan said he would not be disrupting any more sporting events.  A statement by the Archdiocese of Southwark said: ""Neil Horan's faculties to practise as a priest were formally withdrawn on health grounds."""
501,"Since the early '60s, Curtis Mayfield had been proving to the world what a great commercial writer he was. Not only churning out hits for his own band, The Impressions, he'd also scored serious chart action with acts like Major Lance, Jan Bradley and even Brian Hyland. But while his pop soul credentials were immaculate, he'd also been carving out a name as black music's premier exponent of songs that mirrored the civil rights movement in the USA. By 1970 this strand in his music had morphed into Black power consciousness, and his first full foray into tougher territory came with his first solo album, Curtis.  While he was still ostensibly with the Impressions when he recorded Curtis, the music he laid down was a different beast entirely. Rather than the smooth pop of his former band, he chose a grittier funk nand psychedelic edge with which to deliver this missive of consciousness-raising. Recorded at a time when, as Curtis himself said: ''...people stopped wearing tuxedos...people were getting down a little more'', the album, encouraged by his manager, allowed Mayfield to spread his wings and experiment a little more.  While the juxtaposition of strings, harps and throbbing backbeats may well have sprung more from his lack of musical education, the results were startling. Mixing contemporary issues about racial pride and civic responsibility (Miss Black America, Move On Up) the albium was a heady brew of realism and danceable grooves. Only boasting one hit ((Don't Worry) If There's Hell Below We're All Going To Go), Curtis still sold well and opened up Mayfield's career to the extent that he shook off the chains of commercialism once and for all (he left the Impressions for good the following year), becoming a spokesman of his generation."
502,"Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier was back at Anfield to see his side qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals with a magnificent performance.  An early Jari Litmanen penalty and a second-half header from Emile Heskey were enough to give the English side victory over Roma.  And with Barcelona taking all three points in a 1-0 win at Galatasaray, it is the clubs from England and Spain who qualify from Group B.  Houllier was given a rapturous welcome on his first appearance at an Anfield game for five months following heart surgery. And Liverpool got the perfect start as Litmanen - in for the injured Michael Owen - scored from the penalty spot in the sixth minute. The first corner of the night caused panic in the Roma defence and Marcos Assuncao impeded Danny Murphy as the Liverpool midfielder was poised to shoot. Litmanen calmly stroked the penalty into the bottom left-hand corner, and Liverpool immediately set about doubling the advantage. Moments later Steven Gerrard struck a fierce free-kick from 25 yards that Franceso Antonioli did well to parry.  Liverpool flooded forward, with John Arne Riise and Heskey going close as Roma could only manage brief raids out of their own half. Gabriel Batistuta went closest for the visitors in the 35th minute but he failed to connect from inside the six yard box from a corner. Liverpool's dominance was embodied by the energetic Gerrard, who went in at half time needing attention after a challenge with Aldair sent him crashing into the hoardings. Roma boss Fabio Capello brought Marco Delvecchio and Vicenzo Montella on for Batistuta and Lima after the break, and the Italians soon picked up their game.  A smart move inside the Liverpool box ended with Francesco Totti going desperately close - his shot from six yards deflecting wide of the post. The match remained in the balance with chances at either end, Candela heading over in the 58th minute and a Riise shot seconds later stretching Antonioli at the other end. The decisive moment came in the 63rd minute when Damiano Tommasi was booked for pulling back Litmanen. The yellow card proved less significant than the free kick, as Heskey climbed highest to power Murphy's flighted ball into the bottom corner. Roma pushed forward in search of a lifeline, but despite the efforts of Totti they could only create half chances and failed to trouble Dudek in the closing stages. Liverpool continued to look dangerous at the other end through Heskey and the impressive Riise. And with a two-goal cushion the home crowd did not need to wait for news from Turkey to begin celebrating on the final whistle."
503,"Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that the campaign against the M11 extension contributed to a 100% increase in costs.  The Newbury bypass - the scene of Britain's most notorious road protest - was 50% over budget.  Protesters are warning of a similar campaign against airport expansion.  They say the projects ran over budget because of their action, but a spokesman for the Highways Agency said the protesters were only one factor that caused budgets to overrun.  During the M11 campaign protesters barricaded themselves inside houses in east London, which were later bulldozed.  In Newbury they dug tunnels and took to the trees.  The road cost in excess of £100m and took 34 months to complete. It was opened in November 1998.  In total more than 1,000 people were arrested."
504,"He was much loved and admired for his appearances in the long-running series The Two Ronnies, with Ronnie Corbett, as prison inmate Fletcher, in the series Porridge, and as Arkwright, the bumbling, stuttering, sex-obsessed shopkeeper in Open All Hours.  Born in Bedford in 1929, Barker went to school in Oxford, became an architecture student and even toyed with the idea of becoming a bank manager, the archetypal middle-class profession he would later parody so effectively in his comic sketches.  However, he joined Aylesbury Repertory Company in 1948, while still in his teens, before taking to the West End stage at the invitation of Sir Peter Hall, where he appeared in Mourning Becomes Her in 1955.  He appeared in several more plays, and also broke into radio. He was in 300 editions of The Navy Lark as A B Johnson.  Ronnie Barker first worked with Ronnie Corbett in The Frost Report and Frost on Sunday, programmes for which he also wrote scripts. In 1971 they teamed up for the first Two Ronnies.  The scripts relied on masterful wordplay and impeccable timing, and Barker wrote many of them.  Barker himself, however, was among many viewers who regarded his portrayal of Fletcher in Porridge as the best work he ever did. The series ended in 1977, and was followed by the less successful Going Straight, about Fletcher's return to civilian life.  Open All Hours, with David Jason, which ran for several series, was the work which Ronnie Barker probably enjoyed most. He also played - less successfully - a Welsh photographer in The Magnificent Evans and, later, a short-sighted removal man in Clarence.  He wrote three films without dialogue - A Home of Your Own, Futtocks End and The Picnic.  Ronnie Barker won a number of awards. In the late 1970s he was three times the British Academy's best light entertainment performer, and in 1975 he took the Royal Television Society's award for outstanding creative achievement. In 2004 Barker was honoured with a Bafta tribute award and celebration evening for his contribution to comedy.  Equally convincing in an overall, uniform or frilly frock, one of comedy's great chameleons was less happy when asked to walk on stage and play himself. He was modest about his writing skills and often submitted his scripts under pseudonyms, in order for them to be judged on their own merits.  Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself ""completely boring"" without a script.  And when he considered that his own scripts had begun to decline in quality, he left showbusiness in 1988 to open an antique shop near his Oxfordshire home.  As well as citing a decline in health for his reason for retiring, Barker said he always felt he should quit while he was ahead, and he had no further ambitions.  He resisted all calls back from retirement, until he felt compelled to write a play for his actress daughter Charlotte, in 1998. The play received poor notices, and Barker's name was only added to the bill at the behest of the director.  He finally gave in to public demand in 2002, delighting millions of viewers with his first TV drama appearance in more than a decade, as Winston Churchill's manservant, in The Gathering Storm.  Three years before, he had enjoyed a Two Ronnies Reunion Night on BBC One. Barker joined Corbett to introduce the best of their sketches, and the hardware shop ""Four candles - Fork handles!"" set-piece was judged the most popular by a television audience of millions.  Earlier this year the two actors once again reunited for The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, for a six-week run that proved popular with audiences.  Viewers rediscovered the pleasures of the duo's tightly scripted routines, and proved that while Corbett's golfing jumpers had passed their sell by date, the pair's impeccable delivery and the comic chemistry between them had a longer lasting appeal."
505,"You can see why online charter schools in the United States were seen as the next big thing.  Charter schools - publicly funded independent schools - have continued to expand across the US, with supporters seeing them as a way of re-energising standards in state education.  And the educational technology sector has been pushing to bring some hi-tech start-up innovation to teaching and learning.  So it's easy to see how the next step for a 21st Century education seemed to be a virtual classroom, combining the autonomy of charter schools with the flexibility of learning online.  Except a major report, based on research in 17 US states with online charter schools, has found ""significantly weaker academic performance"" in maths and reading in these virtual schools compared with the conventional school system.  The National Study of Online Charter Schools, the first major study of this growing sector, has taken a wrecking ball to the idea that pupils learn as effectively in such an online setting.  Despite the digital glitz, it concludes that online learning has failed to match the teacher at the front of the class.  The report, from researchers at the University of Washington, Stanford University and the Mathematica policy research group, found online pupils falling far behind their counterparts in the classroom. In maths, it was the equivalent of pupils having missed an entire year in school.  Online schools are still relatively small in pupil numbers, but this idea of virtual schooling has been growing quickly and has been seen as a significant future alternative to mainstream classes.  There are currently about 200,000 pupils in online charter schools in the US, says the study. In 2012-13, there were about 65,000 - and although students pay no tuition fees, based on annual funding levels of $6,000 (£3,900) per pupil, that represented $39m (£25m) in public spending.  Online schools, with no physical limits, can grow rapidly, with the study highlighting that one online charter school in Pennsylvania enrolled more than 10,000 full-time pupils.  More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch  These online schools, otherwise known as ""virtual"" or ""cyber"" schools, are defined by teaching more or less everything online. They are an alternative to attending a traditional school, rather than providing additional lessons.  But low achievement in these schools, identified by this research, has raised big doubts about this approach.  The study found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that there was much less teacher contact time in virtual schools. On average, pupils in bricks-and-mortar classrooms received the same amount of teacher time each day as the virtual pupils received on-screen each week.  The online schools relied much more on students driving their own learning and often determining the pace at which they advanced.  And the biggest problem identified by the researchers was the difficulty in keeping online pupils focused on their work.  ""Challenges in maintaining student engagement are inherent in online instruction,"" said report co-author Brian Gill.  ""And they are exacerbated by high student-teacher ratios and minimal student-teacher contact time, which the data reveal are typical of online charter schools nationwide.""  The researchers compared the performance of pupils in online schools with their equivalents in the mainstream schools, in terms of gender, ethnicity, relative wealth or poverty and the prior attainment levels. The most consistent difference in online schools was a disproportionately high intake of white students.  Researchers found that only 2% of online schools outperformed their bricks-and-mortar equivalents in reading. In maths, no online schools were better, and 88% were ""significantly weaker"".  James Woodworth, of Stanford's Centre for Research on Education Outcomes, described the findings as ""sombre"", but said that at least they provided evidence for discussions about the future role of online schools.  The University of Washington's Center on Reinventing Public Education suggested that the findings showed the need for a better regulatory framework for online schools.  The centre's director, Robin Lake, said: ""We need policies that address legitimate concerns without needlessly restricting growth.""  How do you inspect standards in such a different type of school? What should be the admissions rules for virtual schools, so they can teach the type of pupils who would benefit? And how can for-profit providers be incentivised to raise standards rather than recruit more students?  The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools said it was ""disheartened"" at the ""large-scale underperformance"".  Nina Rees, the group's president, said failing charter schools should be closed - and that included online charter schools.  But she highlighted that this report only examined schools that were fully online and that there were many successful examples of so-called ""blended"" learning, where some of the learning was online, but there was also a traditional classroom and teacher.  The study also highlights certain groups who benefit from online schools - such as rural students with limited options, students at home with health problems, those with families moving around the country and those who for whatever reason did not fit in with a conventional school.  Connections Academy, a big US provider of virtual charter schools, said comparisons should recognise the ""distinct nature of instruction and the population served by online public schools"".  The academy called for a more ""productive direction"" to find ways to strengthen online schools.  Because, as it points out, this is a form of education being chosen by a growing number of American families."
506,"She blamed aides to President Viktor Yushchenko for the ""deeply unjust"" move on Thursday, saying they had schemed against her.  She had roused the crowds during the Orange Revolution which swept Mr Yushchenko into power last December.  But on Friday Ms Tymoshenko distanced herself from Mr Yushchenko, who has pledged to root out corruption.  ""Today we are two different teams,"" she said. ""I think these two teams will go their own way.  ""I will not go to the elections with those people who have discredited Ukraine so much. I do not mean the president, but his closest circle,"" she said.  However, she criticised Mr Yushchenko, saying he had ""practically ruined our unity, our future, the future of the country,"" and added: ""I think this step is absolutely illogical.""  Ukraine's acting Prime Minister, Yuri Yekhanurov, has begun trying to form a new government.  President Yushchenko said he had sacked the government because it had become consumed by a power struggle.  He said he acted to preserve the ideals of the Orange Revolution, after his government had been accused of corruption.  Mr Yekhanurov said his priority would be to ensure stability.  Some of the old team are expected to be given jobs in the new administration, says the BBC's Helen Fawkes in Kiev.  The Orange Revolution ousted the regime of former President Leonid Kuchma, widely condemned as corrupt.  But the past week saw three senior government officials resign, precipitating Mr Yushchenko's dismissal of the government.  One of them, a presidential aide, alleged that corruption was worse now than under the previous authorities.  Mr Yushchenko said in-fighting between members of the team had affected affairs of state.  Correspondents say Ms Tymoshenko and the head of the Security and Defence Council, Petro Poroshenko, were at loggerheads from the start.  In a live interview on Ukrainian television, Ms Tymoshenko rejected claims that she had reneged on earlier commitments. She said her cabinet had done an extraordinary job and left the economy in good shape."
507,"Two years ago I was involved in a linguistic incident at work. I called a disabled colleague a spaz after hearing he'd spilt coffee over yet another expensive bit of computer kit.  My colleague laughed it off. It was a friendly bit of banter - spaz in this case meaning I thought he was being a bit of a stereotype like the helpless disabled people you used to see in telethons and charity posters.  I use the term with irony as someone who was regularly called a ""spaz"" in the school playground, though I'm visually impaired and not what we once called ""a spastic"".  To confuse the issue, a non-disabled colleague had overheard and told me that she found that term offensive and thanked me not to use it in front of her. I was offended that she was offended because I didn't feel it was her place to be offended... after all, it's not her word and she wouldn't have been taunted with it.  There is a history of minority groups reclaiming words once used against them. Gay people refer to each other as queer or queens. Black people use nigger in a friendly way. It's about humour, irony and taking the sting out of once powerful and hurtful taunts. It ain't what you say, it's the way that you say it.  So what did Tiger Woods mean when he said: ""I was so in control from tee to green, the best I've played for years... But as soon as I got on the green I was a spaz.""  Is the fact that a nation has lost sight of the origins of the word a good or bad thing? Is it harmful or is it genuinely meaningless now?  ADAPT is America's biggest grassroots disability rights organisation. I rang round some of their members and found out that they didn't even know about the Woods story as it wasn't reported as widely over there. But they did have views on the s-word.  ""When people say 'you're such a spaz' they're talking about someone with cerebral palsy,"" says Nancy Salandra from Philadelphia ADAPT. ""People use it all the time but they are wrong. It's part of the language now, like retard, but it doesn't make it right.""  ""I would think that anybody in the disability community would see it as offensive,"" says Babs Johnson of National ADAPT. ""It would be looked upon as someone having a fit or seizure or something like that. Body movements that you're not able to control.""  Tiger Woods used the word in a live TV interview. An article on Tuesday in online newspaper The Age tracked the reporting of Woods comments and found that spaz was edited out of subsequent news packages. They also say that an LA Times reporter got Tiger to re-word his sentence replacing spaz with wreck so he could report it with no problems.  Never was its potency or currency so big as when the programme featured Joey Deacon in the early 1980s, believing the story of a 60-year-old man with cerebral palsy overcoming the odds would touch the hearts of under-12s.  Oh, how wrong. It unleashed a monster. Spaz, spastic, spacker, joey, spazmo - all became familiar phrases that year and were still being used years later by gurning children in the playground. Spaz became synonymous with useless incompetence - the type you see in disabled people portrayed badly on TV.  Joey even got a mention in a Human League song and on Minder. Not long after, The Spastics Society famously changed its name to Scope. They should have charged Blue Peter for the re-branding expenses.  Interestingly though, Scope were criticised by many younger disabled people last October after they came out against a new US brand of wheelchair, The Spazz, which started selling in Britain.  They said: ""It may be a good chair but we can't accept the name. If it carries on, it won't be long before children are calling each other 'spazzo' in the playground again.""  It was felt that Scope didn't appreciate the irony and humour, used empoweringly, by a company trying to associate something positive with a previously negative word.  Though this golfing incident has whipped up some interesting discussions around language, I'm convinced Tiger never meant to use the word offensively.  But has this whole debate just fanned the flames of those who rail against so-called political correctness or has it made people think about how they might subconsciously be putting disabled people down?  To hear some politically incorrect language used positively with razor sharp disability humour, the new podcast from Ouch featuring disabled comedians Mat Fraser and Liz Carr can be found on www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/podcast  The use of that word is completely unacceptable, whether it's intended to be 'ironic' or not. Nor is it, as the author contends, his word simply because he too has a disability. I'm sure Tiger Woods didn't think about its true meaning when he uttered it but if we allow its use without comment it will gain currency, as will the message that it's OK to make fun of people just because they're different. It's wrong, pure and simple.  Adam, UK  The word ""spaz"" was common currency in UK playgrounds by the early 1970s, long before any Blue Peter stories.   Simon Gray, London  I agree completely with Damon Rose that the way a word is used is the most important thing, although often who uses it has a big effect. I have an artificial leg and was nicknamed ""Peg"" at school. When my friends used it I didn't mind, but when other people used it to tease me I hated it. The word ""cripple"" is generally a lot worse, but I'll use it ironically at times to subvert people's meanings or draw attention to their subconscious attitude.  Bob, Southampton  Re-inforcing a negative stereotype is never acceptable even if the victim accepts the abusive comment. It is still abuse.  Lynda Lawrence, Surrey  Great article. The fact is there are times you can use a word and times you can't. I would probably be far more willing to ironically call a disabled friend a spaz than to use it anywhere else.  Paul Johnson, Horsham, UK  Why should Tiger Woods be made to apologise for something that had absolutely no negative intent? This is another shining example of political correctness gone too far. Surely the reactions of agencies such as ADAPT have only served to make a mountain of a molehill, while those with disabilities are saying to the tv screen ""none taken""?  Mike, Pembrokeshire  If the use of the word ""spaz"" has caused offence, who has caused it the most - Tiger Woods who said it in the first place but reached a relatively small audience thanks to the US media, or the BBC who have blown the whole thing out of proportion and have made sure that everyone in the UK is now aware of it?  Colin Hunter, Bolton  'Idiot' was once a term for people with learning disabilities, now it has lost that meaning. I doubt 'spaz' will ever become a readily used term and will fade away. As will 'scope-head' which I believe is now a term of abuse in some playgrounds across the country. However, until then it's probably better to find a derogatory word about oneself that doesn't refer to derogatory stereotypes of others.   Neil, London  The use of the word john meaning toilet was an insult, should we stop using that? If i called my boss a spaz i would expect some reprisal, but if i called my best friend a spaz it wouldnt matter. Its all about context and good judgement. Tiger woods did not have good judgement, i dont think   Andrew,  What grated on me the most was what Dame Tanni Grey Thomson said yesterday on the matter. ""You know he's not one of the rough football players who's gambling and getting drunk and being in clubs, you know he's quite a straight guy."" I'm wheelchair bound; like gambling, drinking and going to clubs. I'm offended that she used the things i like to do in a dergotory way. Will she be made to apologise along with Tiger for the offence caused?   Robin Malinowski, Newcastle-upon-tyne  People should say what they want to say, offensive or not. Who's problem is the offence? I certainly have no guilt offending anyone, its my life and I will say what I want.  Mike Brown, Corby, Northants, England  Speaking as an American, I was shocked to read this article and find that Britons use ""spaz"" to refer to cerebral palsy. Over here, it's a very mild insult used generally to refer to someone who is uncoordinated or graceless. There's no implication of a physical handicap. What this article really demonstrates is that Europeans once again have failed to appreciate that Americans have their own culture.  Darrell, USA  Saying that people who aren't disabled can't be offended by such words is like David Brent in The Office claiming that white people can't be offended by racist jokes. Words carry a lot of meaning, historical baggage and emotional impact. Please use them with more respect.   Brian, Luxembourg  I take the point about minority groups reclaiming offensive words but Tiger is not, as far as I am aware, part of the group in society to whom the word ""spastic"" was once applied. To me thinking ""spaz"" feels wrong - let along saying it in public during an interview.   Lindsay , Stirling  My 11 year old son has Asperger's Syndrome and frequently finds it difficult to understand other people's actions and comments. For the past few weeks a small group of slightly older kids have been calling him a 'spaz' at every opportunity. While he may not fully understand what a 'spastic' is he does realise that the phrase is being used to hurt him and he is becoming very upset about it. I can understand you colleague becoming upset at you calling you friend a 'spaz'. I would too as I know the hurt it causes my son when it's used.  Jude, N. Ireland  I'm offended that you were offended that your non-disabled colleague was offended. A comment does not have to be applicable to you for you to find it offensive. I'd probably ask you not to use such terms in front of me in just the same way I'd ask you not to use racist or homophobic terms, even though I am white and straight.

508,"Every year at the end of October a crowd gathers in central Moscow next to a large stone, brought from a Soviet prison camp.  As music plays quietly, people step up to a microphone, one by one, and read out a list of names.  After each name comes a date and one, stark word: ""Shot.""  The ceremony is organised by Memorial, Russia's oldest civil rights group established in the late 1980s by dissidents including Andrei Sakharov.  It works to restore the memory of the hundreds of thousands of victims of Soviet political repression.  But Russia's justice ministry has called for Memorial to be ""liquidated"", throwing the group's future into doubt and raising protest at home and abroad.  ""The aim is to put pressure on independent, civil society,"" argues Memorial's Alexander Cherkasov, who says the ministry's complaints concern details of how Memorial and its numerous national branches are registered.  Memorial's leaders contacted the ministry to discuss the new requirements at a conference called for late November, but they won't have a chance. They have been summoned to a Supreme Court hearing on 13 November which will rule on the organisation's closure.  ""They want to shut us down,"" Mr Cherkasov believes. ""There's no understanding that groups like this are an important part of a healthy society.""  This summer, Memorial's human rights wing was forcibly registered as a ""foreign agent"" under a new law singling out groups that receive grants from overseas.  Over the years, its activists have been a regular thorn in the government's side, documenting human rights violations in Chechnya, political detentions, and more recently criticising Russian involvement in the crisis in Ukraine.  But highlighting the darkest episodes of Russia's past may also be unpopular, when politicians are busy stoking national pride and recalling more glorious eras.  ""It may be a political gesture, to shrink the possibilities for organisations like Memorial,"" said EU Ambassador to Russia Vygaudas Usackas.  He called for Russia to demonstrate that such concerns over free speech were ill-founded, by giving the group time to comply with new regulations.  Russia's foreign ministry rejects all suggestion that the case is political: the justice ministry has uncovered ""violations"" at Memorial that need addressing, a statement reads.  But those gathered around the Solovetsky stone were sceptical.  ""I think it's an attempt to stop what we're doing now,"" Elena Bagrimenko says, after laying a candle and flowers beside the memorial stone.  Her own great grandfather was a priest, killed in the purges - Stalin's deadly, paranoia-fuelled drive against supposed ""enemies of the state"".  ""Of course we are worried,"" she adds as others intone more names in the background. An economist, a hospital accountant, a peasant - all shot.  ""If Memorial is stopped our history will be silenced and the victims forgotten, just as we were beginning to remember them,"" she argues.  ""If we don't remember these things, they can repeat and I'm afraid they will,"" adds Mikhail Markovich, who believes that political repressions in Russia are increasing again.  But he takes hope from the large crowd queuing to recall the victims of Stalin's Terror.  A sign on the square recalls that in 1937-38 more than 30,000 people were executed in Moscow alone. Without the work of Memorial, their names and their stories may never have been known."
509,"It came about after a legal battle between the Professional Golfers Association of India (PGAI) and Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM).  TSM organised the previous Indian tour for eight years, but the PGAI annulled its contract in June.  But European Tour regular Jyoti Randhawa insisted: ""This is not a breakaway tour, it is a tour.""  The new tour is being run under the auspices of the Professional Golf Tour of India.  Confusion still lingers, however, with many domestic players refusing to ditch the PGAI and backing TSM to continue playing a role.  But Asian Tour player Gaurav Ghei urged his fellow players to join the new tour.  ""Our tour is going to grow,"" he said. ""The guys on the international tour have agreed to take time out to play on the domestic circuit."""
510,"A Derbyshire rock band have teamed up with an eighties pop star to record a Marilyn Monroe-themed concept album.  Saracen, from Matlock, enlisted the help of US singer Robin Beck to provide the voice of the Hollywood icon on several tracks on Marilyn.  Beck, who had a UK number one hit in 1988 with First Time, was approached through a friend of the band who works in the music industry.  Guitarist Rob Bendelow described her contribution as ""an inspiration"".  The band, which formed in 1977, came up with the idea for the collaboration two years ago when Bendelow wrote a song about Monroe's relationship with John F Kennedy for use on a concept album about the former US president.  After Beck agreed to lend her vocals to the track, Bendelow was so impressed with her performance he decided to change the whole direction of the album.  He said: ""Robin's performance of the song left me speechless and perspiring. One Sunday morning, with a pal we listened to it in my car.  ""His smile was so wide when Robin ripped out of the speakers that I thought his jaw was going to break.  ""He asked me how many songs Robin was going to do on the album. When I replied: 'Just this one I think?', he retorted: 'You must be joking.'  ""Our discussions that day led me to re-evaluate the whole album to determine which songs had to come from Marilyn.  ""I was then able to talk to Robin about the possibility of her doing all of the first person numbers - some of which weren't even written at that point.""  ""Robin was totally up for it - it was delightful. She truly stepped up to the plate with each song in turn.  ""I used my wife's reaction each time as an acid test. When listening to Robin's rendition of Not For Sure, Bridget's goose pimples were the size of blueberries.  ""I found Robin's attitude alone to be inspirational. It was all very special.""  Beck's contribution was recorded at her home studio in Florida and added to the mix in the UK.  Marilyn also features contributions from legendary saxophonist Snake Davis who has played with Paul McCartney, Cher and Tina Turner.  Bendelow said he was delighted with the finished product and even dreams of one day turning it into a musical.  He said: ""Pretty much everyone involved with this album has told me, independently, that it would make a fantastic West End-style rock musical.  ""Recently we went to see We Will Rock You in Birmingham. Magnificent. But throughout the show, a little part of me couldn't help imagining Marilyn unfolding up there on the stage."""
511,"The fixture is part of the South Yorkshire club's 150th anniversary celebrations, confirming their status as the world's oldest football club.  ""I think he's quite honoured to be invited to mark 150 years of the game,"" Sheffield FC chairman Richard Tims told BBC Sport.  Inter Milan won 5-2 and Tims added: ""This is where football kicked off.""  With Fifa president Sepp Blatter having attended the club's anniversary dinner last month, Tims believes Sheffield's contribution to shaping the game is recognised across the globe.  Formed on 24th October 1857 by Sheffield cricketers William Prest and Nathaniel Creswick, many ideas the club adopted are still used in football today.  ""In the early days, this club was the driving force behind the organisation of the game. That's what Blatter and football historians recognise,"" Tims said.  ""This wasn't just the first football club - it made many innovations to the game. It was pioneering, and developed things like crossbars, corner kicks and free kicks.  ""I'm not saying that without Sheffield FC there wouldn't have been football, but we were there first.""  Currently playing in the UniBond First Division South, Tims insists the club's emphasis remains not so much on climbing the leagues as providing an alternative to the modern game.  ""Before the Football League came along around the time of professionalism, football was just a game, played for sporting endeavour. Now, football is an industry - Sheffield were never really part of that.  ""If you like, this club is a conscience for the world of football and money.  ""Let's not forget what football actually means to most people around the world. It's not about how much money you can make out of it, it's about playing for the love of the game, jumpers for goal posts and all that.  ""We're not a million miles away from league football, and I would never say never, but I wouldn't say it's high on our agenda. We are realistic - five years ago we didn't even have a ground.""  As part of his visit, Pele will open an exhibition which will include the first public showing in 40 years of the original hand written rules of football. A Sheffield FC visitors centre will feature in the club's future plans.  ""People are always interested in the historical roots of things,"" said Tims. """"We've got artefacts and memorabilia that should be of interest to every football fan around the world.  ""Sheffield FC is a powerful brand. We're trying to become everyone's second favourite football team, so whether you support Bolton Wanderers or Boca Juniors, you can still support the world's oldest football club."""

513,"Campaigners against plans to install 400,000 volt power lines through a North Somerset valley have held a public meeting.  The Save Our Valley group is fighting proposals for 160ft (48 metre) high electricity pylons through the valley near Nailsea, Backwell and Wraxall.  The National Grid wants to install the pylons to link a new power station at Hinkley Point with Avonmouth.  Protesters say the new power lines would ruin the countryside.  Two options have been proposed. The first would see some of the existing power lines to the west of Nailsea in the Causeway area replaced.  In the second option, new lines would be built running south of Nailsea across Youngwood Lane, Backwell Lake, Backwell Common, before turning north across Wraxall.  A spokesman for the group said: ""If Corridor 2 is built, Nailsea would be surrounded on three sides by 160 feet high, 400,000 volt overhead power lines.  ""Backwell will be exposed to these cables for the first time and Wraxall will have them directly overhead.  ""Wraxall Primary School and church will both be overshadowed by pylons and power cables and the tranquillity and purity of Backwell Lake will be gone forever."""
514,"The charges ranged from armed rebellion to ""outrage against the constitution"".  Sentencing is next month and they could face the death penalty, says the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt in Ethiopia.  Hundreds of thousands took part in demonstrations complaining of fraud and vote-rigging by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's government in the 2005 polls.  The opposition leaders refuse to recognise the court and did not present evidence in their defence.  The judge said that because they had failed to defend themselves he had no option but to find them guilty.  One leader of the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy in London, found guilty in absentia, told the BBC it was ""very sudden and tragic news"".  Almost 200 people died in two waves of protests.  The CUD blamed the deaths on the security forces but Mr Meles accused the opposition of starting the violent protests.  His government also points out that it introduced multi-party elections to Ethiopia after years of military rule.  In the elections, the opposition made huge gains but says it was cheated out of victory.  An independent inquiry carried out by an Ethiopian judge concluded that the police had used excessive force.  He went on to accuse them of carrying out a massacre. The judge later fled Ethiopia, saying he had been put under pressure to change his findings and had received death threats.  Two months ago, a judge threw out controversial charges of attempted genocide and treason against 111 people arrested after the election protests.  The violence and the charges of election fraud have tarnished Mr Meles' image as a favourite of Western donors and one of a new wave of reforming African leaders."
515,"Reg Varney's first major TV role was in BBC sitcom The Rag Trade Comedy actor Reg Varney, best known for playing driver Stan Butler in ITV sitcom On The Buses, has died aged 92. He died following a short illness in a nursing home in Budleigh Salterton, Devon, where he had recently been admitted with a chest infection. His daughter Jeanne Marley, 59, said her father had died ""peacefully"" on Sunday afternoon. On The Buses was one of the most successful British comedies of the 1970s, with over 60 TV episodes. Varney's partnership with co-star Bob Grant, who played randy conductor Jack Harper, saw them become household names for a generation of viewers. The series, which ran for seven years from 1969 and spawned three feature films, followed the two characters as they dodged work and did their best to wind up inspector Cyril ""Blakey"" Blake, played by Stephen Lewis. Mrs Marley said he had only recently been admitted to the nursing home after he had begun suffering from a chest infection. She said: ""He's always been very young for his age. When he was in On The Buses he was playing a 35-year-old, but he was actually 50."" The On The Buses cast after Bob Grant's 1971 wedding to Kim Benwell Varney was born in east London as one of five children, and attended school in West Ham. He worked at the Regent's Park Hotel after leaving school, but went on to play the piano and sing in working men's clubs. Varney entertained the forces during World War II, where he served in the Royal Electrical Engineers, and later appeared in seaside shows and played pantomime dames. He first came to the public eye in BBC sitcom The Rag Trade, in 1961, and starred alongside Pat Coombs and June Whitfield in another comedy, Beggar My Neighbour, in 1966. In 1967, Varney opened the UK's first automatic cash dispenser in Enfield, north London. HAVE YOUR SAY I always find it upsetting when a comedian dies as they bring so much happiness to everyone. The success of On The Buses saw him land his own, self-titled TV series, as well as roles in films Go For A Take and The Best Pair Of Legs In The Business. Later in his career Varney spent time in Australia and New Zealand, sometimes working as a pianist. A remake of On The Buses was mooted in 1990, but failed to be commissioned. Varney had lived in Devon for the past 20 years, and had lived alone since his wife Lilian died in 2002. He is survived by his daughter, two grandchildren, and one great-grandchild."
516,"A French appeals court has cleared US airline Continental of criminal blame for the July 2000 crash of a Concorde jet shortly after take-off from Paris.  The ruling comes two years after another French court fined the airline and held it criminally responsible for the crash in which 113 people died.  But Continental may still be liable for damages after the court said the firm still bore civil responsibility.  A piece of metal from a Continental jet was blamed for causing the crash.  But Continental labelled the initial court decision and its explanation absurd, and launched an appeal.  The Air France Concorde burst into flames and crashed into nearby buildings after it took off from Charles de Gaulle airport, killing all 109 people on board and four hotel workers.  Most of the passengers were German tourists heading to New York to join a cruise to the Caribbean.  In 2010, a French court decided that the crash had been caused by a titanium strip that had fallen from a Continental airliner.  The US operator was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, fined 200,000 euros (£160,000) and ordered to pay 1m euros in damages to Air France.  In addition, a Continental mechanic, John Taylor, was given a 15-month suspended prison sentence over the crash.  Thursday's ruling overturned the criminal convictions of Mr Taylor and Continental and quashed the 200,000-euro fine.  But the court said Continental still bore civil responsibility and upheld the 1m-euro payment.  Separately, Air France is suing Continental for 15m euros at a commercial tribunal.  The US airline had consistently argued that the Concorde caught fire before it hit the metal strip, and that they were being used as a scapegoat to protect France's airline industry.  The airline's parent firm, United Continental Holdings, said in a statement it supported the court's decision that Continental was not to blame.  ""We have long maintained that neither Continental nor its employees were responsible for this tragic event and are satisfied that this verdict was overturned,"" the statement said."
517,"Kele Okereke says he's already thinking about the band's fourth record    Saturday 23 August 2008: what could be construed as a pivotal moment in the history of Bloc Party. Their appearance on the main stage at Reading Festival - the mood a mixture of triumph, celebration and defiance - came three days after the startling digital release of their third album Intimacy. Looking back, that show was the centre point of what had been an undulating year for the band which saw them unveil the digital release of their new album. It was a move some saw as backfiring, others as ingenious. Add to that the arrival of children [bassist Gordon Moakes had his first daughter], side projects [guitarist Russell Lissak flirted with electro group Pin Me Down] and an altercation with the Sex Pistols' John Lydon at a Spanish festival - and it's been an eventful 2008. ""It's weird - the year has gone really quickly,"" says Kele, today slumping into his sofa at home struggling to fend off a cold. ""We started writing the record now it's already out - it's been a busy year for us..."" Months before Reading, as the band walked offstage at this year's NME Big Gig at London's 02 Arena in February it seemed like that would be the last we'd see of them for some time. Yet, after secret new year recording sessions, they were already busy plotting the follow up to 2007's second album A Weekend In The City. ""Rather than do it [the recording] in three months we did it in two weeks,"" Kele explains about the evolution of the LP. ""We wanted to do something a bit different this time around to get the record to the fans quicker - we knew before we recorded it that it was going to be an unconventional release."" I've never really felt any sense of satisfaction whilst we've been in Bloc Party    Untypical it very much was - following Radiohead's precedent for releasing their record digitally before in a physical format, and making it available in the middle of the summer festival season [21 August]. ""Every year that we've done this has been different to the year before,"" sniffs Kele. ""That's just part of being in this band, you have to embrace these new experiences. It'd be frightening if every day wasn't different - that's the best thing about it."" The record's arrival was an unexpected bombshell which took fans and the industry alike by surprise was still deemed a success by the group. ""It was nice, because we got it directly to the fans and they seemed to really like it and that's what really counts for us,"" he says. ""I definitely am pleased with how we released it."" ""You're always trying to strike a balance between what is commercially viable and what you might want as an artist."" Kele pauses. ""Things that you want to do and things that you have to do. ""I don't know how we're going to release the next record,"" he admits. ""It might feel quite regressive to go back to a conventional release. ""I've had a chance to think about new music - I'm always thinking about songs."" However, what followed Intimacy was more conventional: a bout of intensive international touring. ""With our previous releases with Silent Alarm and A Weekend In The City by this point into the campaign I'd already started to hate the music,"" he admits. ""Where as this time round I don't hate the music - we did something right."" All which has meant Kele and co. have had little time to think about any music outside of their own this year. Bloc Party will embark on a UK tour in January 2009 ""I don't listen to albums much any more - I don't sit down and listen to records as much as I used to,"" he says. ""It's patience - it just wears thin. I just have no patience,"" he admits. ""The way that I listen to music now because of what we do it's very critical - I listen to something obsessively for like a week and then I never listen to it ever again."" ""That's why singles are good because there's no context it's just a song."" This of course, is a very different band from the gang of fresh faced boys larking around the east end of London in 2004. Kele remains the last member left in the city - the others living miles apart - a situation Kele describes as ""fine."" ""You spend so much time with each other - you need other people in your life. I don't think that it's a bad thing that when you come off tour you don't see each other."" ""It's healthy to have some time apart - to have a life outside of what it is we do."" While it seems Bloc Party are constantly exploring new directions for releasing their music, one thing they're not seeking to change is the live show. ""As a live band we're quite successful,"" he says looking forward to their UK tour dates in the new year. ""I don't really want to mess or interfere with how we perform as a band. ""It's incredibly rewarding - the sensations that we get when we play live, I don't want to manipulate or obscure that. ""I don't really think about doing some kind of Zooropa [U2's famously decedent tour] change - the energy that we produce live is very instinctive and primal so I don't really want to think too much about altering the chemistry."" Four years down the line then, with arena tours, digital albums and creative freedom - you'd imagine Kele couldn't be happier. ""I guess I think my problem is that generally as a person I don'tthere's always some other mountain to climb once you've done something,"" he says. I've always had a drive and a hunger that has maybe stopped me appreciating what we've achieved    ""I've never really felt any sense of satisfaction whilst we've been in Bloc Party. ""I've always had a drive and a hunger that has maybe stopped me appreciating what we've achieved. ""I don't think I'll ever be content whilst I'm in Bloc Party because there will always be something else to do - some other goals to achieve. ""I know that when we stop doing this that's probably when - I mean that's probably going to be too late - but that's when I'll feel a sense of pride about what we've achieved but right now I'm just fighting the good fight. ""We've got more records to make, so that's what I'm thinking about."""
518,"All accounts of the British constitution start with Professor Albert Venn Dicey (1835-1922).  As Vernon Bogdanor acknowledges, it was Dicey who first analysed the British constitution and emphasised its historic nature.  It was also Dicey who explained that much of our constitution is based on conventions.  These conventions are customs or rules that are respected as a fundamental part of our constitution even though they are not enforceable as rules of law.  Here are some of the examples quoted by Dicey in 1885:  When the House of Lords acts as a court of appeal, peers who are not law lords take no part in the proceedings. These conventions remain part of our constitution. Others have developed since Dicey's time. Indeed, the whole system of cabinet government depends on constitutional conventions. Take the Prime Minister, for example. Britain has had one since the eighteenth century, but not because parliament sat down one afternoon and said so. Indeed, it was not until 1917 that a statute first noticed we had such a person, when the official 'now popularly known as Prime Minister' was allowed to live at Chequers. By the same reckoning the cabinet was first spotted in 1937 when parliament decided its members would receive salaries; likewise the Leader of the Opposition. The Ministers of the Crown Act 1937 did mention in passing that there were such things as political parties, but it was not until 1969 that MPs came out of the closet and allowed party descriptions to be printed on ballot papers. Constitutional conventions do not last for ever. As they have not been created by law they do not need formal repeal: people simply stop observing them. There was apparently once a convention that the Home Secretary should be present at a royal birth. Times change - and so do constitutional conventions."
519,"The location work in London was in the can and filming for Terry Gilliam's latest production had been about to move to Vancouver in Canada. Then came the untimely death of actor Heath Ledger.  Ledger, 28, had been the biggest name on the cast list of Gilliam's work in progress, the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, and, according to co-star Christopher Plummer, the American-born director had been a ""very good friend"" of Ledger's.  As tributes poured in for the actor, the future of the $30m (£15.4m) film lay in doubt. ""'Parnassus' is shut down,"" said the Hollywood Reporter. But while Plummer speculated to the press that Ledger could be digitally recreated to finish the film, Gilliam seems to have been hatching a more creative solution - enlisting three big name actors to play incarnations of Ledger's character.  According to Jude Law's spokeswoman, Law, Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp will play the role of Ledger's character, Tony, in the film, subject to negotiation. It is thought that original footage of Ledger will remain.  The plan lends a new twist to a problem that has dogged filmmakers since the early days of cinema - how to complete a movie when one of the headliners dies before it's a wrap.  While Gilliam's close friendship with Ledger appears to be an important motivator in his wish to complete Parnassus, the bottom line is often a more compelling reason to keep rolling.  As casting director Carol Dudley recalls being on the MGM lot during the aftershock of Natalie Wood's death, while making Brainstorm in 1981.  ""People wanted to get their money back. They had to find a way to make it work.""  The film was completed with a stand-in and clever camera angles designed to obscure the fact that the screen siren in the frame was not the same as the name which graced the posters for the film.  The body double approach to making up for a death in service has been around at least since 1937 when Jean Harlow died, aged 26, during the making of Saratoga. With filming 90% complete, a lookalike and two Harlow sound-a-likes (voice doubles) took up where the star left off.  But in those days before computer-generated imagery (CGI), pulling off the body double trick convincingly was a tall order - never more so than in the notorious B-movie Plan 9 From Outer Space. Director Ed Wood had only bagged about two minutes of footage of lead actor Bela Lugosi for the film when the actor died of a heart attack.  Undeterred, Wood rewrote the script and enlisted chiropractor Tom Mason, who stood a foot taller than Lugosi, for the role. Wood tried to conceal the stark difference in height between the two men by having the stand-in stoop. As for the lack of facial similarity, Mason cloaked his face with a Dracula-like cape.  The film was panned, but Dan Jolin, features editor of Empire magazine, says it was all part of Wood's charm.  ""Ed Wood was a singular filmmaker and wouldn't let anything stop him from making the film he wanted to make. It's so obvious the guy standing in for him is a different height. But in a film with wobbly gravestones and flying saucers hanging from bits of string it actually works.""  The advent of CGI lent a more professional edge to filling in for newly deceased actors. Probably the first film to use computers to this effect, says Jolin, was John Candy's last movie, Wagons East.  ""They finished the film without him and used footage of him that was tweaked but it was weird and uneven and it felt like Candy wasn't really in it.""  By the time of Oliver Reed's death, on the set of Gladiator, in 1999, computer effects had progressed to such an extent that Reed's living, breathing absence was barely noticeable. If there was a crack, says Jolin, it was more in the continuity.  ""The only slightly jarring thing was [Reed] was going to live in the film. There was a line he said to Russell Crowe in the film and that was used as the final line and it felt clunky.""  By comparison, Gilliam's novel solution to Ledger's death is consciously low-tech. But the director's biographer, Bob McCabe, says he believes the solution is a ""brilliant idea"" and characteristic of Gilliam's ""fantastic imagination"".  ""If you are a filmmaker you have a responsibility to try to get the film made, but it has to be true to itself.""  Carol Dudley notes Gilliam's idea would be unthinkable in a ""straight thriller. [But] filmmakers like Terry Gilliam are walking a line between hyper-reality and fantasy and so can get away with this sort of idea.""  ""It's something his films can rise to,"" says Dudley. ""Why not make lemonade from the lemon rather than sweep it under the carpet.""  I have seen Brainstorm countless times and, being unaware of the fact that Wood died during filming, have never noticed her absence.  Nancy Bang, Esbjerg, Denmark  Bruce Lee's last film, Game Of Death, features stand-in doubles, cardboard cutouts, and an actor wearing a paper mask with Bruce's photograph printed on it!  Andy, London  It's worth mentioning the first effective use of CGI to complete a film where one of the leads has ""died in service"" was The Crow. After Brandon Lee's tragic death, the film was completed using digital composites from existing footage of Lee.   Dermot Canniffe, Galway, Ireland  I find it amazing what can be achieved these days. I recall watching The Crow - where Brandon Lee died mid-way through filming - and being totally unable to see what is 'genuine' Brandon and the late fill-ins. I'm sure Gilliams fix will be most effective. I just continue to find it very sad that events have occurred which means he has to do this.   Merson Tuffers, Staffs, UK  The notion that Gilliam's solution is novel though, I find hard to believe. Its seems very similar to the idea of 'I'm Not There' - the film in which Heath Ledger himself was just one of the actors playing the character of Bob Dylan along with the likes of Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett.   Charlie, Cambridge  Gilliam's idea is nothing new - David Lynch did it purposely in 'Lost Highway', when Bill Pullman's character is incarcerated, and the next morning has transformed into Balthazar Getty, playing a completely different character - baffling both the police and the audience in typical Lynch fashion.   Martin Conaghan, Glasgow  It's nice to see the film industry using an idea first introduced in Doctor Who. But I bet they won't acknowledge it!  Mick Clarke, Elland West Yorkshire"
520,"Organisers say Help: A Day in the Life is the fastest-selling download album.  Stars recorded 22 songs on Thursday and Friday and by Monday lunchtime fans had spent £40,000 downloading the tracks.  It also features Keane and Kaiser Chiefs and will be released on CD on 26 September. A decade ago, the original Help album raised £1.25m for War Child.  Help: A Day in the Life, which costs £9.99 to download, is currently on the warchildmusic.com website and will be available on major download sites from Tuesday.  ""We receive data from the Official UK Charts Company every week and no download bundle or album has sold anywhere near the amount that Help did in a single week let alone over just two days,"" he said.  The Official UK Charts Company said it was unable to confirm whether Help had set a record.  The War Child site crashed under the demand and the album is on course to be the biggest selling download album, organisers say.  Some fans have downloaded single tracks for 99p each and Radiohead's new song I Want None of This is currently the most popular choice.  Among the other offerings is Coldplay's How You See The World, which had been available in Japan but was remixed by the band remixed in New York on Thursday.  War Child patrons Keane recorded a version of Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road while Kaiser Chiefs covered I Heard It Through The Grapevine.  Antony and the Johnsons, fresh from picking up the Mercury Music Prize, contributed a version of John Lennon's Happy Xmas (War is Over) with Boy George.  Artists were asked to enter the studio at 1200 BST on Thursday, although some started work a few hours early. The completed album went online at about 1810 BST on Friday.

521,"The Daily Telegraph has obtained details of MPs' expenses claims over the past four years which it has published.  Here is a summary of the claims made by some Labour politicians and their reaction to the reports.  Claim: The Sunday Telegraph said Mr Kemp, the MP for Houghton and Washington East, claimed for two DVD players for his one-bedroom flat in the space of a month. He was also reimbursed for the cost of 16 bed sheets and claimed for two flat-screen televisions a year apart, it was reported. In the case of one of them, the Fees Office refused to pay the full £1,699 he asked for on the basis that the maximum claim was £750, it was suggested. The former Labour whip was also said to have bought goods including a freezer and fridge near his north-east England constituency, despite the London flat being designated his second home. He also charged the taxpayer £105.75 for an engineer to attend to his washing machine when he could not work out how to operate it, the Sunday Telegraph claimed.  Response: Mr Kemp told the Sunday Telegraph the claims for bed linen and a second DVD player were ""an error for which I apologise"" and that he would pay back the cash. He said he bought the second TV and fridge before moving in to a new flat. He said there had been a problem with his washing machine but that he would be happy to reimburse the sum claimed. On suggestions he had profited from the sale of his second home by claiming £1,532 to cover legal fees, he said: ""I'll seek advice from HMRC to ensure appropriate liabilities have been met.""  Claim: The Tyne Bridge MP was said to have ""bought out"" his partner's share of a joint mortgage on a flat in London, costing the taxpayer thousands of pounds plus legal fees. The Telegraph said that after the deal, which was approved by the Commons Fees Office, the mortgage interest payments increased by £200 per month.  Response: Mr Clelland insisted it would have cost the taxpayer more had he rented a flat. He said his partner had initially viewed the property as an investment but that she legitimately decided to withdraw her money in 2004, when it was rumoured that MPs might be ordered to hand over any profits made from such properties to the taxpayer. He told the BBC the London flat was ""not a home, it's the flat I live in... [it] is what I have to have to do my work as a member of parliament and that's why the costs fall on the taxpayer.""  Claim: The Telegraph said the Bury North MP claimed nearly £13,000 for a mortgage he had already cleared. The paper says that between September 2005 and August 2006, the Labour backbencher claimed £1,175 a month in interest on his Westminster flat. However, Land Registry records show the mortgage was paid off in January 2004. The Telegraph also alleged that Mr Chaytor ""flipped"" the designation of his second home six times, including once to a house registered in his son's name. He reportedly blamed these actions on ""changing and complex family circumstances"".  Response: In a statement, Mr Chaytor told the Telegraph he apologised ""unreservedly"" for what had been ""an unforgivable error in accounting procedures"". He reportedly told the paper he would arrange repayment to the Commons fees office immediately. Mr Chaytor has referred himself to the parliamentary standards watchdog and has also been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the outcome of investigations. He has decided to stand down as an MP at the next election.  Claim: The Telegraph said the former environment minister claimed £16,000 in mortgage interest payments on his home in his Scunthorpe constituency even though the mortgage had ended 18 months before. Although records show his mortgage had been repaid by March 2006, Mr Morley continued to be reimbursed for £800 a month in 2006-7. The Telegraph claims the anomaly was not spotted earlier as Mr Morley re-designated his London home as his second residence - a move known as ""flipping"" - in November 2007. It says Mr Morley had been renting out his London flat to another Labour MP, Ian Cawsey who nominated it as his second home and claimed back the £1,000 a month rent he paid to Mr Morley. This arrangement ended in March 2008 after the Commons Fees office became aware of the situation.  Response: Mr Morley admits the error was entirely his fault and has apologised ""unreservedly"" for it. He says he repaid all of the money once he had discovered his mistake. He has referred the matter of his expenses to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner for further scrutiny. However, Gordon Brown has acted by suspending Mr Morley as a member of the Parliamentary Labour Party and also suspending the whip from him in Parliament. Mr Morley has also been suspended from his role as Gordon Brown's climate change envoy. He has also said he will stand down as an MP. Mr Cawsey told the Daily Telegraph he had been unaware of Mr Morley's financial arrangements.  Claim: The Telegraph says the Dewsbury MP claimed £66,827 from the second home allowance - the maximum allowed - over three years towards the cost of his London flat - bought in 2001 before he was elected. According to the paper, Mr Malik's claims over the period included £2,100 for a flat screen television, £1,420 for a bathroom, £671 for a fireplace and £730 for a massage chair. It says the Fees Office rejected the TV claim - ultimately granting the MP £1,050 for a TV and £250 for a DVD system - and a further claim for an iPod. Mr Malik is also reported to have claimed for a £65 court summons for not paying council tax. While claiming the equivalent of £443 per week for his London flat, the Telegraph says Mr Malik was paying less than £100 a week to rent a property in his constituency from a local businessman. It says the rental agreement with the businessman, from whom it says the MP also rented a constituency office - began in 2004 and continued until 2008 when Mr Malik married and moved into a larger property in the town.  Response: The justice minister defended his claims as being totally within the rules but did temporarily step down from his post pending an inquiry into whether he had received a preferential rent on his Dewsbury property and if so, whether that breached the ministerial code. He emphatically rejects claims he was paying a peppercorn rent for his Dewsbury property, saying this was a fabrication. Mr Malik has repaid the £65 claim for council tax summons and has said he will make a £1050 donation - relating to the value of the TV - to good causes in his constituency as a ""gesture"". He said he would not give the money back to the fees office because they had approved all his expenditure in the first place. He said he had claimed for ""basic essentials"" under the second home allowance such as mortgage interest, utility bills and council tax and had behaved ""one million per cent by the book"". As for furnishings, he said he did not receive a ""good service"" from the Commons Fees Office which didn't tell him there was an upper limit on individual claimable items. He says the Green Book which governs what MPs can claim was full of ""subjective rules"" and the system was now ""in tatters"". He said he had never ""flipped"" his home arrangements and always spent most of his time in Dewsbury. He said the Telegraph had picked him out - rather than David Cameron, who he said had claimed as much as him - because it was a Conservative-supporting newspaper. Mr Malik was investigated by No 10's adviser on ministerial interests, who, No 10 said, cleared him of receiving a preferential rent or breaching the ministerial code. After that verdict he was appointed as communities minister.  Claim: The prime minister paid his brother, Andrew, £6,577 for arranging cleaning services for his Westminster flat for 26 months.  Since reporting the arrangement, the Telegraph group has clarified that there ""has never been any suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the Prime Minister or his brother"".  Response: No 10 said the two shared a cleaner who worked in both their flats. Andrew Brown paid her and was reimbursed for his share of the cost. He did not do the cleaning himself or gain financially.  There was a formal contract for the arrangement, Downing Street sources add, stipulating the cleaner's hours of work and pay. The cleaner wanted to be paid by one person for National Insurance purposes.  Claim: Gordon Brown also claimed twice for the same plumbing work within six months of each other.  Response: The House of Commons Fees Office said the mistake had been inadvertent and apologised for having not spotted it. Gordon Brown is understood to have repaid the sum involved - believed to be £150.  Claim: The justice secretary over-claimed £1,500 on council tax on his second home.  He made a claim for the full bill despite getting a 50% discount from the local authority for the property.  Response: A spokesman for Mr Straw said he acted within the rules. He spotted the mistaken council tax claim himself and repaid the money himself. Mr Straw later told the BBC: ""I have acted in complete good faith and within the rules. It is an error, which obviously I wish hadn't happened, but in circumstances in which I was incredibly busy during that period - that is not an excuse, it is just an explanation.""  Claim: The culture secretary was reportedly battling with the fees office for eight months over a £16,500 expenses claim to buy and renovate a new London flat which was eventually paid, after being rejected three times.  He also claimed a £19.99 bath robe bought from Ikea in 2007 that was not allowed.  Response: Mr Burnham insists he did not profit from the property transaction. He made only permissible claims and returned a £1,000 surplus to the Fees Office for allowances he did not spend.  On the Ikea receipt, he made a ""genuine oversight"" on one item. When it was discovered, he corrected it and he was not reimbursed.  Claim: The business secretary claimed for improvements on his constituency home after he announced he was leaving Parliament to become an EU Commissioner.  He later sold the property for a profit of £136,000.  Response: Lord Mandelson rejected claims he used taxpayers' cash to ""renovate"" his home for profit, insisting the money was spent on essential maintenance. He said the Telegraph's report - which details a £1,500 gardening bill and £1,350 in house repairs - was presented to provoke public anger. ""The fact is that these allowances would not have been paid if they weren't within the rules,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland.  Claim: Veteran Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman is alleged to have claimed £1,851 for a rug imported from a New York antique centre and tried to claim more than £8,000 for a television. The Telegraph also said he entered a claim for £28,834 - more than £15,000 of which was paid - for improvements to his London home, after telling officials he was ""living in a slum"".  Response: Mr Kaufman refused to comment publicly on the allegations when confronted by reporters in his Manchester Gorton constituency. Earlier, he reportedly told the Telegraph he had offered to repay the money for the rug and called the television claim ""a bit daft"".     Claim: The Welsh Secretary claimed for a new boiler after saying his existing hot water system was ""too hot"".  Response: His old boiler was replaced after it was deemed unsafe and could not be repaired. All his claims were within the rules and ""assiduously"" checked by the authorities.  Claim: The former deputy prime minister claimed £312 for the fitting of mock Tudor beams to the front of his constituency home in Hull and in December 2004 a plumber charged him £210.79 for pipework, taps and to ""refix WC seat,"" according to the newspaper. In September 2006, he put a £112.52 repair bill on expenses, which included ""refit WC seat"".  Response: Mr Prescott said: ""Every expense was within the rules of the House of Commons on claiming expenses at the time.""  Claim: Taxpayers contributed almost £100,000 to help pay the mortgage on a £1.35m flat owned by the Northern Ireland secretary, it is reported.  The money went on mortgage interest payments and council tax between 2004 and 2008 for the flat. Married to a member of the Sainsbury family and worth an estimated £15m - Mr Woodward is the richest member of the cabinet, though he does not draw a full ministerial salary.  Response: The Northern Ireland secretary's spokesman has said the claims are within the rules and guidelines but Mr Woodward admitted politicians collectively looked ""shameful"". He said: ""If I try to make almost any defence of our collective position - or my position - it looks terrible."" However, he added that politicians of all parties ""are good people who try by and large to do a good job"" within a ""rotten"" system.  Claim: The Telegraph claims the Europe minister put solicitors' fees and stamp duty totalling £14,553 on her Parliamentary expenses after buying a central London flat.  Before moving in to her second home in Victoria, she also claimed the £177 a month cost of putting her furniture in storage. Over a period of about eight months in 2005 to 2006, Ms Flint claimed for staying in hotels for an average of three nights a week.  Response: Ms Flint told the Telegraph she had sought advice from Commons officials at each stage and ""never sought to make personal gains from public funds"". She said only about half the cost of her London flat - including stamp duty - was met through public funds as she had contributed a ""substantial amount"" towards the cost of buying it from the proceeds of a previous flat sale.  Claim: The MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East claimed £2,800 for a settee and £2,000 for a carpet to furnish his second home. The Telegraph also accused Mr Goggins, who is Northern Ireland minister, of ""flipping"" his two houses in London and Manchester to make a profit. The paper also reports he allowed a university friend to live rent-free in a home paid for by the taxpayer.  Response: Mr Goggins defended his household purchases by saying he liked to ""live by decent standards"". ""I do not lead an extravagant lifestyle, people should remember that we have to furnish our first home with our own money,"" he said.  Mr Goggins denied flipping his houses and said he was told to change the designation of his second home when he became a minister: ""To try and suggest that I did it to make money is absolute nonsense, it was compulsory.""  On allowing university friend Chris Bain to live rent-free, he said the arrangements were based on a ""30-year friendship"" and due to the fact that Mr Bain had been the joint owner of the property for six years between 1997 and 2003.  Claim: Mrs Beckett found herself in trouble with the Fees Office after attempting to claim £600 for hanging baskets and pot plants.  An official informed her in a letter that expenses had to be ""wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred to enable you to stay overnight away from your main home"". She claimed second home allowances of £72,537 from 2004 to 2008, despite having no mortgage or rent to pay on her constituency home in Derby. As environment secretary and foreign secretary, Mrs Beckett was living at the grace and favour Admiralty House in Whitehall, which enabled her to rent out her London flat.  Response: The former foreign secretary said: ""Grace and favour homes are not rent free, we are taxed on them as a benefit in kind.""  Claim: The Chief Whip claimed £18,000 in expenses without receipts for food over four years. He also claimed £250 a month for a cleaner, £200 a month for ""service and maintenance"", and £200 a month for ""repairs"" - all without receipts. Mr Brown - who has been put in charge of investigating claims involving Labour MPs - also claimed £87,708 for his constituency home between 2004 and 2008. In 2007/8 his mortgage interest repayments were £6,600. But he claimed £23,068 - just £15 below the maximum permitted - by including £4,800 for food, £2,880 for services, £2,880 for ""repairs and insurance"", £1,810 for utilities, £1,640 for phones and £897.65 for cleaning.  Response: Mr Brown, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend, told his local newspaper, The Journal, that his claims were ""not unreasonable"" and were all for genuine expenses. He added: ""I am working flat out for the people that I represent and the politics that I believe in.""  Claim: The tourism minister claimed £25,411.64 for security patrols at her London home after she was mugged.  She also requested £528.75 to have a Chinese needlepoint rug repaired and cleaned but that was deemed excessive by the Fees Office and she was handed back just £300.  Response: Mrs Follett told the BBC: ""I claimed it, it's within the rules and I have no comment to make."" She had earlier told the Telegraph that only two of the claims she had submitted during the last 12 years had been disputed and that the one item not accepted had been claimed in error.  Claim: The Telegraph suggested the immigration minister had claimed for nappies and women's clothing when submitting requests for expenses.  It said it was unclear how these items had been justified because parliamentary rules only allowed payouts for items which were ""exclusively"" for MPs' own use.  Response: Mr Woolas has threatened legal action over the ""disgusting"" allegations. He said the items had been on supermarket receipts submitted as part of a claim for food expenses but that he had never asked for money for them. Mr Woolas described the expenses records as ""stolen property"".  Claim: In response to Mr Woolas' complaints, the Sunday Telegraph claimed that in August 2004 he had submitted five receipts totalling £210.31 for food and was reimbursed in full. However, the paper points out that the receipts included non-permissible items such as disposable bibs, nail polish, comics and a ladies' jumper.  Response: Mr Woolas told the newspaper he understood the extrapolation but insisted he had done nothing wrong. He has pointed out that - under rules at the time - he was not obliged to submit receipts for food totalling up to £400. He has also pointed out that he did not claim for women's clothing, as the newspaper claims. He said he had actually submitted six receipts totalling £245.98, meaning he did not receive taxpayers' money for some items. ""I am being hung out to dry for being honest,"" he said.  Claim: Care Services Minister Phil Hope was said to have spent more than £37,000 over about four years on refurbishing and furnishing a two-bedroom south London flat.  Response: Mr Hope has said his claims for running and furnishing the flat were ""in full accordance with the rules"" and that the purchases were ""no more than was necessary to live in a habitable residence"". However, he has decided to pay back £41,709 of the money in light of the public anger about the expenses system. He said negative coverage about his claims had been a ""massive blow"" to him and his family and reduced the standing in which he was held by his constituents.  Claim: The Labour whip offered to ""dig out"" other receipts after she over-claimed rent on her constituency home by £2,600 - an offer which was accepted by the Commons fees office. After the Brent South MP bought a home in Wembley, she claimed £2,650 for a central heating system and installed a whirlpool bath in a suite costing £2,308 - even though her main home was just 15 miles away in east London. Though just £800 was claimed for the bathroom, the parliamentary green book says payments should not be made for ""capital costs of repairs which go beyond making good dilapidations and enhance the property"".  Response: Ms Butler denied the claim about the whirlpool bath and said she was taking legal advice. ""There is nothing underhand here in any of my claims. All the claims are for legitimate expenditure,"" she added.  Claim: The chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee claimed more than £75,000 to fund a second home in Westminster, even though his family home is just 12 miles away in Stanmore.  The Telegraph also suggested he changed his designated second home for a single year to property in his Leicester constituency, before claiming more than £4,000 on furnishings.  Response: Mr Vaz told the BBC he lived in Leicester and that his second home was in Westminster. He has had a Westminster flat since becoming an MP in 1987. He made no claim for the Stanmore home, which he acquired on getting married and was - he pointed out - not in central London. ""It's on junction 4 of the M1 and I keep the Westminster flat for early morning meetings as do many MPs who live in that block,"" he said.  Claim: A health minister, the Telegraph claimed he had switched his second home designation to a more expensive jointly-owned London property and claimed full mortgage interest payments, in order for his partner to ""benefit from the system"".  The couple had previously split the mortgage costs, the paper said. However, it claimed that Mr Bradshaw was now submitting the entire cost of interest on the property to be paid out of expenses.  Response: Exeter MP Mr Bradshaw told the BBC he had always claimed for their London home and only briefly switched to claiming for his constituency property between 2003 and 2006, because of a temporary rule telling ministers to claim constituency rather than London costs. The minister said before he and his partner entered into a civil partnership in 2006 he had claimed only a proportion of the mortgage interest - even though he would have been entitled to claim it all. Since then, he had claimed for and paid the full mortgage interest on their London property, as the rules allowed, he said. He added that he always submitted comparatively low claims and had long called for reform of the expenses system.  Claim: According to the Telegraph, the Labour MP for Luton South spent £22,500 treating dry rot at the coastal property in Southampton she had designated as her second home - even though it was a two-hour drive from Parliament and 100 miles from her constituency.  Response: Ms Moran has now said she will pay back the money claimed for her Southampton home. She said it was claimed in full consultation with staff at the Commons fees office and said she had stuck to the rules. But she added: ""However, I do understand constituents' anger at the current fees regime, which is why I will be repaying the full amount claimed for my home in Southampton."" Explaining her claim days earlier she said her partner had worked in Southampton for 20 years and that she could not ""make him come to Luton all the time"". She said: ""I have to have a proper family life and I can't do that unless I share the costs of the Southampton home with him."" Ms Moran also said there had been some ""inaccuracies"" which were ""probably actionable"" in the Telegraph reports.  Claim: Within a year of being elected in 2005, Ms Ussher is said to have set out to the Commons authorities over two pages a list of ""essential repairs"" to her Victorian house in south London.  It detailed how the house ""was relatively cheap to purchase but requires quite a lot of work"". Among the work listed was replacing ""rotten"" sash windows and a ""grimy"" stair carpet. She received the full £22,110 allowance, although her requests to replace ""strange"" plumbing and ""bad taste"" Artex were refused. The Sunday Telegraph claimed she had already lived in the house for five years.  Response: The work and pensions minister's spokesman said Ms Ussher ""fully supports"" the review into MPs' expenses claims and believed it was right that MPs expenses' claims should be published. ""All her claims were in line with the relevant House of Commons rules and guidance and have been approved by the Fees Office,"" he said.  Claim: Former long-serving Labour MP Tam Dalyell attempted to claim £18,000 for bookcases, two months before retiring from Parliament in 2005, the Telegraph alleged.  Response: Mr Dalyell, formerly MP for Linlithgow, said he was ""absolutely unrepentant"" about the claim. He told the BBC he had bought the bookcases to store documents gathered during his political career and had approached the Fees Office to ask what proportion of the £18,000 he could claim back in expenses. He said the office eventually paid about £7,800. He said he believed it was ""a legitimate office expense"" and would ""definitely not"" pay the money back.  Claim: It is claimed the junior minister had a £450 widescreen television delivered to his family home in Wales and then claimed it on his allowance for his second home in London.  Response: Mr Brennan, Parliamentary Under Secretary in the Cabinet Office, said the Telegraph story was ""a thinly-disguised smear which has absolutely no basis in fact"". He said all items claimed for which were purchased in or delivered to his Cardiff home were for exclusive use in the London property, and after the larger items were stored in his garage they were taken east by a local business. Mr Brennan insisted that he had always stuck to the rules, but said the system needed to be ""urgently reformed"".  Claim: The MP for Brent North made a profit of almost £200,000 from a flat mortgaged and renovated with the help of taxpayers' cash, the Telegraph has alleged. He is yet to respond.  Claim: The Telegraph accused the MP for Rhondda of ""flipping"" his second home twice in two years, allowing him to claim almost £20,000 in expenses.  Response: Mr Bryant, who is deputy leader of the House of Commons, described the allegations as ""unfounded and inaccurate"". The openly-gay MP said he moved to a more secure property after ""a series of attacks on my home"" and had asked the Fees Office what work on the new house he could claim back.  Claim: The Solicitor General - one of the government's top legal advisers - was refused a £268 claim for Christmas decorations.  Response: Ms Baird insists she has broken no rules.  Claim: The former Trade Secretary used the expenses system to claim more than £125,000 for the London flat owned by his partner, it is claimed.  Over the past five years, Mr Byers is said to have spent more than £27,000 on renovation, redecoration, maintenance and appliances at his flat in Camden, north London.  Response: Mr Byers told the Sunday Telegraph all his claims were within the rules and had been approved by Commons authorities.  Claim: The Telegraph has suggested the former Home Secretary claimed for a £199 pouffe, a £370 armchair and an £899 sofa.  He is also said to have submitted receipts for £486.50 spent at Marks and Spencer last August on items including slotted spoons, three rattan bins, oven mitts, wineglasses and ice cube trays. His expenses claim for 2007-08 also included a letter from the TV Licensing authority warning the occupier of the property ""there is no valid television licence"". Mr Reid's office pointed out that the TV licensing letter was addressed to the previous occupier of the property.  Claim: The former Prime Minister used his parliamentary expenses to remortgage his constituency home for £296,000 - nearly 10 times what he paid for it - just months before buying a west London house for £3.65m.  According to the Sunday Telegraph, the loan would have been enough to cover the cost of the deposit on the new home. It said he was able to claim for interest repayments on almost a third of the new mortgage on his constituency home.  Response: His spokesman told the newspaper Mr Blair only claimed back the interest repayments on the portion of the mortgage which covered the purchase price and improvements to the house. There was no cost to the taxpayer in the rest of the money raised against the property, he added.  Claim: The government whip claimed up to £1,150 in ""petty cash"" over eight months on her second home allowance. When told by the fees office in 2004 that cash payments were not permitted, she stopped claiming but did not return the money. Ms Ward, MP for Watford, switched her second home to a flat just a few minutes walk from her old property and more than doubled her mortgage interest payments.  Response: Ms Ward told the Telegraph that the claims for ""petty cash"" were clarified as ""miscellaneous household items"". She denied ""flipping"" her second home for financial gain, saying that she had sold a one-bedroom flat and bought a two-bedroom flat in anticipation of her new family. As she had an offset mortgage, she said, her housing costs had ""fluctuated"".  Claim: Edinburgh North and Leith MP Mark Lazarowicz claimed more than £5,000 in costs for legal and professional fees incurred in extending the lease of his London flat.  Response: Mr Lazarowicz has decided to repay about £2,675 of those costs.  While the claims had been approved by the Fees Office, he said he had only realised the scale of the legal costs associated with the extension - which led to a lengthy dispute - in recent days.  He said the amount was ""much higher"" than many of the public would be prepared to accept and that it was right that he repaid a ""substantial"" share of it.  Claim: The Telegraph says Labour MPs Alan and Ann Keen - who are married - have claimed £137,679 between them towards a central London flat despite the fact their family home is less than ten miles away. According to the paper, the couple bought the London property in 2002 and have, between them, claimed more than £30,000 towards it in each of the past four years. The couple's main home is in Brentford. Alan Keen is MP for Feltham and Heston while Ann Keen - a junior health minister - is MP for neighbouring Brentford and Isleworth. The paper said the couple claimed for interest payments on a £520,000 mortgage for the London flat even though the actual purchase price of the property was £500,000. It also claims the Fees Office had reduced their awards in 2007 because both MPs had claimed for council tax on the London property. Among the couple's claims on the London property, the paper adds, were a £50 call-out fee for fixing the sound on a home cinema system.  Response: The couple say that, under the second home allowance rules, married MPs are entitled to separately claim for a property that they share and live in together. Alan Keen said the Commons authorities had agreed to the mortgage repayment claims after the couple explained to them that their bank had asked for the loan to be secured against both properties for added security. He said the authorities had agreed that the value of the London flat was £520,000, the couple having bought it for £500,000 and agreed to pay the seller an additional £20,000 for fixtures and fittings.  Claim: The government whip attempted to spread his claim for stamp duty on his second home in London across two financial years. Mr Austin, MP for Dudley North, divided the stamp duty on the purchase of the London flat in March 2006 into two claims - £6,770 on 28 March and £1,344 on 3 April. As a result, he was able to claim nearly all his second home allowance for the financial year 2005/6. Although the £1,344 claim was rejected by the fees office, Mr Austin was repaid for the move's legal costs in 2006-7. He was also alleged to have ""flipped"" his second home weeks before purchasing the flat.  Response: Mr Austin told the Daily Telegraph that an error in calculating the costs of the move resulted in the stamp duty claim being refused. He said the fees office had advised him to split the costs over two financial years. Mr Austin added that he apologised for the miscalculation and no payments were received or made as a result of the error.  Claim: Labour's former chief whip claimed £3,100 towards the cost of treating the gables and walls of her constituency home.  Response: The MP for Durham North West says the gables needed correcting because of a problem of ""hornets getting into the cavity wall"". The work was ""essential"" to maintaining the basic infrastructure of the house, she added.  Claim: The Labour whip and MP for Birmingham Hall Green over-claimed £4,059 on his mortgage over two years.  Response: Mr McCabe told the BBC he disputes the sum. He said he ""did make an error"", as he told the Telegraph. But once the Fees Office notified him of this, he sorted it out by offsetting against subsequent claims.  Claim: The Wirral South MP claimed for interest payments on his mortgage that he had already paid off, the Telegraph reports.  Having repaid £295,000 of the loan in 2002, Mr Chapman continued to receive £15,000 over 10 months for the interest part of the mortgage which he no longer paid. According to the Telegraph, this situation was not unique to Mr Chapman.  Response: Mr Chapman says the Fees Office has informed him that the advice he was given in 2002 about what he could claim back on his mortgage was incorrect and he was effectively ""misled"". He regrets the error was not spotted earlier but that it was dealt with in 2003 when it emerged. He says he never intended to receive money he was not entitled to and stresses there is no evidence that this ever happened. He says he has done nothing wrong. However, he has decided to stand down at the next election because of the damage that the allegations have done to him, his family and his constituents.  Claim: The former Labour party chairman claimed £16,000 on furniture and decorating his second home but repaid it all last year after the rules on what MPs could claim for were tightened up.  Response: ""I personally decided to ask for an audit of my old accounts based on the new system.  ""All the amounts that I have claimed were with the rules and appropriate and had been approved. Despite the terrible flaws in the system I have done everything humanly possible to do the right thing.""  The MP has since announced he will be standing down at the next election for health reasons.  The Bridgend MP submitted receipts for more than £4,000 on furniture for her designated second home, in London, that was delivered to her constituency home in Wales.  Response: ""The Welsh shop in Wales even when it is for installation in London by a London contractor.""  Claim: Ms Johnson, a government whip and MP for Hull North, claimed nearly £1,000 for hiring an architect for a decorating project at her second home.  Response: Her spokesman said her home was in a conservation area and had required planning permission to replace the windows. The work was carried out after it had been found that the windows were rotten. All of the expenditure had been approved. However, Miss Johnson repaid the money around two months ago.  The MP for East Leeds claimed £62,000 in expenses over four years for his London flat while having a mortgage of £26,000. The fees office questioned him over buying furniture in Leeds despite having assigned his London flat as his second home.  Response: The Labour backbencher said that although bought in Leeds, the items were for his flat in London. He added: ""The goods were purchased in Leeds mainly because I prefer shopping with my wife. They were transported to London when convenient, either by car (the smaller items) or by van.""  Claim: The paper says Mr Davidson claimed nearly £1,500 for reclining furniture for his London flat although it was delivered to his main home in Glasgow. It reports that the MP paid a property search firm nearly £6,000 to help him find a flat, a proportion of which was reimbursed from public funds. It also says he paid a ""family friend"" £5,500 to renovate his second home.  Response: The MP for Glasgow South West, a member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, says he employed a professional property firm after spending ""many fruitless hours"" looking for a flat in London. He said the Fees Office agreed the cost of this was ""acceptable"". The Commons authorities gave him permission to employ a Glaswegian firm to do essential work on his flat rather than a London-based one as it was cheaper, he added. The furniture was initially sent to Glasgow as his constituency home was always occupied while access to his London flat for deliveries was limited as it fronted onto a bus lane and had restricted parking. It was later delivered to London.  Claim: The Daily Telegraph alleged that the former cabinet minister claimed £31,000 of taxpayers' money for flood damage to her second home, even though she had a building insurance policy at the time.  Ms Kelly also tried to claim £3,600 for a sofa and chairs, £2,355 for a dining table and chairs, and £2,000 for a plasma screen television but they were reduced by the fees office for being excessive.  Response: Ms Kelly insisted that she made an entirely legitimate claim after flooding at her constituency home. She told the BBC that ""my claim was neither ludicrous claim nor a phantom claim"", unlike others featured in the Telegraph. She argued that the furniture which she claimed to replace was ""worthless"" since it was 30 years old having been inherited from her parents - and so could not have been claimed on insurance. She says that the rebuilding work was handled in her absence whilst she was juggling being a minister and the mother of four young children. She concedes that she did not explore whether she could have claimed on her building insurance.  Claim: The North East Derbyshire MP spent £1,800 on a television, £2,900 on a sofa and £1,950 on a bed within months of being elected. She also claimed a total of £90 for 12 wine glasses and six champagne flutes. She says she told the fees office she did not want to claim the full amount for the household goods as she was aware that they were luxury items, before submitting her receipts. She received £750 each for the television and the bed plus £2,000 for the sofa.  Response: Ms Engel said she had put her expenses with explanatory notes on her website.  Claim: The junior education minister submitted a receipt for a £100 pair of hair straighteners. But she was told she would not be reimbursed because the fees office was ""unable to allow costs relating to personal items, in this case hair stylers"".  Response: Ms McCarthy-Fry, who is also MP for Portsmouth North, told the Daily Telegraph: ""I fully accept this was a personal item that was claimed in error and was correctly rejected by the fees office.""  Claim: The Daily Telegraph said Dr Gibson claimed for a flat which his daughter and her partner lived in rent-free. It also claimed the Norwich North MP then sold it to them for less than he paid and well below market value.  Response: Dr Gibson has insisted he acted within the rules and ""made nothing on the house whatsoever"". But he said he could understand why members of the public might think his arrangements were ""unfair"" and offered to stand down as an MP if his constituents wanted.  Claim: The chancellor claimed £10,000 towards the cost of furnishing the London flat he bought in 2005, according to The Telegraph.  Mr Darling bought the £226,000 property near the Oval cricket ground, claiming £2,074 for furniture and £2,339 for carpets. There was also a £765 claim from Ikea and £768 from Marks and Spencer's for a bed. The £146 cost of staying in a hotel while his flat was being renovated in September 2005 was rejected by the fees office on the grounds that the property was counted as his second home.  But Mr Darling successfully argued that he was ""between second homes"" and the bill was later paid. He also used his expenses to cover the stamp duty of £2,260 and legal fees totalling £1,238.  It was also reported that Mr Darling ""switched"" the location of his second home four times in four years, allowing him to claim thousands of pounds towards the cost of both his Edinburgh home and for the London flat.  In further disclosures about MPs, Mr Darling was said to have spent £1,400 for help filling in his tax return over two years.  According to more of the Telegraph's revelations, in July 2007, having just become chancellor, Mr Darling claimed £1,000 for the service charge at his south London flat.  This charge covered the six months to the end of year, during which time he had begun to claim second home allowances on his grace-and-favour home in Downing Street, and rent out the other flat.  Response: Mr Darling said: ""The claims were made within House of Commons rules which were designed to reflect the fact that MPs have to meet the cost of living in two places.""  He added that he had employed an accountant ""to ensure that the correct amount of tax was paid in respect of my office costs"".  On the service charge bill, Mr Darling's spokesman initially insisted that the report was wrong. However the chancellor has now said that he will repay £700 of the bill to cover the period when he was not living there.  ""When I reclaimed the cost of the service charge in July I was living in the flat. However, because the service charge covered the period beyond September until December I will repay the service charge from September to December.""  Claim: The communities secretary claimed for three different properties in a single year, spending almost £5,000 of taxpayers' money on furniture in three months, the Telegraph reports.  She also claimed for stays at London hotels after selling her flat. In March 2004, she declared her property in her Salford constituency was her second home and spent £850 on a television and video and £651 on a mattress. In April, she switched her second home to a flat in south London, claiming £850 a month for the mortgage.  In August, she sold the flat, making a £45,000 profit, and stayed in hotels over the following two months. In December, she bought another London flat for £300,000, claiming a monthly mortgage of £1,000 and a grocery bill of £400.  It was also reported that she claimed for accountancy services and a £219 digital camera.  Response: Ms Blears has admitted she did not pay capital gains tax (CGT) on the £45,000 profit from the flat sale and has agreed to repay £13,332. CGT is charged at 40% on the sale of homes the Inland Revenue does not consider to be a main residence. At the time, it was registered as her second home for expenses purposes. Ms Blears said she had complied with both Commons and Revenue and Customs rules but had agreed to repay the tax anyway. Ms Blears said her outlay on furnishings - such as mattresses and pillows - was ""reasonable"". She added that her use of an accountancy firm was in line with Commons rules.  Claim: The Daily Telegraph said the Transport Secretary did not pay capital gains tax on the sale of his London home in 2006. Previously, it had reported that Mr Hoon switched his ""second home"" designation - refurbishing his family home in Derbyshire at taxpayers' expense before buying a London townhouse.  At the time he was defence secretary and later Commons leader and had a ""grace and favour"" Whitehall apartment. After losing that apartment in 2006, the newspaper says he bought a Georgian townhouse in Westminster and declared that as his second home. He went on to claim £21,995 in 2006/07 and £23,083 in 2007/8 - the maximum allowed. His monthly mortgage interest payments, picked up by the taxpayer, increased from £270 to almost £900.  The newspapers also said that his claims for accountancy services reached almost £3,000 over two years, and that he put a £200 digital camera on office expenses.  Response: Mr Hoon said he rejected ""any suggestion of any wrongdoing"" and said he had been ""assiduous"" in reporting his tax obligations. He said the Inland Revenue and a firm of chartered accountants he had consulted had both agreed there was no need to pay capital gains tax. A spokeswoman said he did not intend to repay any money and Downing Street has said it believes he complied with the letter and the spirit of the law.  In response to the earlier claims, Mr Hoon said he still had ""significant costs"" to meet at his grace and favour flat at Admiralty House - although it was rent free. ""These were comparable to the costs I would have incurred if I had continued to live in my own property, therefore a claim under the ACA for my constituency home was not unreasonable,"" he said. He said officials told him it was within the rules and similar claims had been made by previous ministers. His claim for accountants was also within the rules, he added.  Claim: The foreign secretary claimed almost £30,000 for doing up his £120,000 constituency home over five years, it was reported. He spent up to £180 every three months on the garden at the property in South Shields. Additionally, he paid the husband of former Labour MP Meg Munn for tax advice.  Response: According to Mr Miliband's spokesman ""at every stage, David Miliband followed procedures and rules as laid out by the parliamentary authorities.""  Claim: The International Development Secretary's constituency home was damaged in a house fire in 2007 after he spent more than £30,000 on repairing it, according to the Telegraph.  He told the fees office he was ""under-insured"" and claimed almost £2,000 on items lost in the fire, which he later repaid when his insurers reimbursed him. He claimed £2,413 in accountancy bills and £230 for a digital camera, but was forced to pay a £750 bill for Christmas cards himself after being told they were not covered by the allowance. He also reportedly charged for advice from media consultant Scarlett McGwire and paid for advertising at lower league Johnstone Burgh FC.  Response: Mr Alexander said that he had sought the advice of the Fees Office after the fire that damaged his property, ""to obtain their guidance as to what it was appropriate to claim in these circumstances, given my continuing need for accommodation to allow me to undertake my work as an MP"". He said the camera was used to take photographs of constituency events.  Claim: The Home Secretary was reported to have bought husband Richard Timney, whom she employs as her assistant, a £240 Apple iPhone on her office expenses. Ms Smith had previously been forced to pay back £10 she had claimed for two adult films he watched.  She also charged the taxpayer for her accountancy costs and £1,600 for three digital cameras and a camcorder over three years.  Response: A spokesman for Ms Smith said the claims were needed for responses to ""constituents' needs"", according to the Daily Telegraph.  Claim: The Leader of the Commons claimed over £10,000 for the services of media consultant Scarlett McGwire. Ms Harman, who is Labour's deputy leader, submitted more than a dozen claims for the adviser's help between 2004 and 2007.  Response: A spokesman for Ms Harman said: ""The sum paid to Ms McGwire was in respect of advising on and drafting speeches, including speeches on flexible working for parents, on tackling domestic violence and increasing childcare; drafting questionnaires to her constituents; editing of her annual report to her constituents on issues such as housing, the NHS and policing; editing of constituency newsletters; and editing of other reports for her constituency and parliamentary work.""  Claim: The Environment Secretary claimed £1,882 for tax advice over a period of three years, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: Mr Benn, who is the MP for Leeds Central, has not yet commented on the report.  Claim: The Daily Telegraph alleged that the work and pensions secretary avoided paying capital gains tax on the sale of a London flat after claiming expenses for tax advice from an accountant. The paper says he also charged for a £395 accountant's bill that included advice on the sale of his flat.  Response: Mr Purnell is challenging the allegation that he avoided capital gains tax. A spokesman said any such suggestion was ""completely untrue"". He said Mr Purnell sought advice that the rules were the same for MPs as other taxpayers and asked Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to double-check his calculations. The spokesman added: ""When he bought his constituency home, the sale of his London flat fell through, but it was sold within the period that HMRC continue to treat it as not being liable for CGT. No one pays CGT when they sell the only house they own and James was not liable for capital gains tax on his London flat."" HMRC confirmed that there was no capital gains tax to pay, the spokesman said. Downing Street has said it was backing Mr Purnell.  Claim: The Telegraph says Ms Cooper re-designated, or ""flipped"", her second home from a property in South Yorkshire to the London home she owned with her husband Ed Balls in 2005 - after he was elected to the Commons. After that, the paper says the couple each claimed half of the share of their £1,468 mortgage interest costs. In May 2007, the couple moved to a larger home in London and began claiming £1,031 each in mortgage interest as well as £2,000 in moving costs. According to the paper, the two submitted the same claim twice in July 2006. Additionally, Mr Balls was said to have charged £33 for two Remembrance Sunday poppy wreaths, although the claim was turned down.  Response: Ms Cooper, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said she sought advice from the Commons authorities before changing her second home arrangement in 2005. The two MPs say they split the cost of bills evenly and since moving in 2007, have claimed less than in allowances than in the previous two years. Between them, they claimed just over £24,000 in 2007-8, above the £23,083 limit for a single MP but well below the £46,000 threshold for couples. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner investigated their second home arrangement in 2008 and approved it, pointing out the couple had paid capital gains tax on the flat sale. The couple said the 2006 'double claim' was an inadvertent error and the correct amount was paid once spotted. Mr Balls added that the claim for the wreaths ""was submitted in error by a staff member"".  The Medway MP claimed £118,000 for expenses at his second home, including stereo equipment, redecoration and a pair of Kenyan carpets, the Daily Telegraph reported. In 2006 he claimed £750 for a ""multi-room audio system"" and £830 for a DVD recorder and other electrical products.  Response: Mr Marshall-Andrews said the claims for his TV and DVD recorder were met from second home allowances ""in error"". They were used mainly for office purposes and should have been claimed as such, he told the paper. He added that all his other claims had been ""within the spirit and letter of the law"".  The Leeds North East MP declared his mother's London home as his main residence, letting him claim thousands of pounds on improving his family home in Leeds, the Daily Telegraph said. He also overcharged by £2,850 in 2004 by claiming for full mortgage payments when he was entitled only to the interest, it added.  After being challenged by the Commons authorities, Mr Hamilton offset £1,950 of the overpayment by submitting receipts for furniture, while agreeing that £900 could be docked from his next month's claim to account for the rest.  Response: Mr Hamilton said he spent the majority of his time with his mother before her death, paying a ""substantial"" sum towards the upkeep of her house.  Expenses submitted submitted by the Grimsby MP included 67p for Ginger Crinkle biscuits, 68p for Branston pickle and a bottle of malt whisky costing £22.99. In 2007, Mr Mitchell also claimed £2,938 for interior redecoration of his second home and £1,200 for re-upholstering sofas. He also had a bill for ""security shutters"" at his London second home turned down.  Response: Mr Mitchell's wife, Linda McDougall, told the Daily Telegraph that she had submitted the claims for food on her husband's behalf, and admitted that she ""made mistakes"". The MP himself said it had been necessary to have his sofas re-upholstered hundreds of miles away in Yorkshire because ""because everything is cheaper and better there"" but offered to donate the coverings to the Telegraph's offices. He added that he had suffered a series of break-ins prior to fitting the shutters, but there had been none since.  The Leytonstone and Wanstead MP claimed thousands for the redecoration of his second home before selling it and charging taxpayers £12,000 for stamp duty and fees on a new property, the Daily Telegraph said.  Among other items he was reported to have claimed were £1,222 for new blinds and £5,232 for furniture. Mr Cohen also claimed £4.25 for baby wipes and £8.75 for men's shaving oil.  Response: Mr Cohen said the house had been very dilapidated as the previous owner had lived there since 1933. He had used a back bedroom as an office, but his wife had a stroke while the refurbishment was being planned. This made it necessary to leave the three-floor property. He has offered to refund the cost of the toiletries.  The MP for Weaver Vale in Cheshire charged almost £15,000 in three years for his house in Kennington to be cleaned and for his clothes to be laundered and ironed.  Response: Mr Hall said his claims were ""legitimate and reasonable"" and reflected the cost of having to live and work in London.  The ex-whip, who is MP for Erewash in Derbyshire, spent hundreds of pounds just prior to the end of the financial year to take her second home claim as near to the maximum as possible, the Daily Telegraph alleged. Last-minute items included a £199 DVD player, a £150 fax and a £99 rug.  Response: Ms Blackman told the newspaper that the household items for her rented London flat were purchased ""with the full approval of the House authorities"".  The junior justice minister spent thousands on refurbishing a bathroom at one of her flats before ""flipping"" her second home designation to another property, the Sunday Telegraph said. Ms Eagle, MP for Liverpool Garston, was paid £3,500 in expenses towards the cost of the work.  Response: Ms Eagle told the newspaper that she had been ""scrupulous"" about sticking to the rules. She said she had been required to designate her London property as her main home when she became a minister in 2001. When this rule changed she switched the designation because she spent more time in Liverpool.  Claim: The Enfield North MP - whose seat is a 40-minute drive from the Commons - claimed expenses for £4,500 of repairs at her constituency home before ""flipping"" her second home to another south London property, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: Ms Ryan, a former junior Home Office minister, told the paper that the rules had required her to register her flat as her main home when she was in government because it was closest. But after she was dismissed from her role as Cyprus envoy, she switched it to the Enfield property as she spent more time there.  Claim: The MP for Erith and Thamesmead claimed more than £10,000 for the redecoration of his London flat, which was just 11 miles from his main home, before selling it for a £30,000 profit, the Daily Telegraph reported. After buying a new property, he claimed £10,000 in stamp duty and other expenses incurred in the move and a further £15,000 for a new bathroom, kitchen, carpets, and appliances.  Response: Mr Austin said the report was ""inaccurate and misleading"" and said he was seeking legal advice.  Claim: The Deputy Chief Whip and Labour MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West received £86,565 in second home expenses for his Westminster flat between 2004 and 2008. Most of these claims were mortgage interest payments of £1,000 a month, council tax and ground rent payments.  Response: Mr McAvoy has not responded to the report.  Claim: Mr Lucas - MP for Wrexham and a government whip - claimed approximately £1,000 a month for mortgage interest payments on a London flat, which he sold for a £45,000 profit, the Daily Telegraph said. Taxpayers were then billed £6,000 for sale fees. Mr Lucas then claimed almost £4,000 for staying in hotels before buying a new flat and claiming for stamp duty, purchasing fees, furniture and mortgage interest payments. He also spent £550 on a ""hip hop"" bed and extra-firm mattress, and £838 on a sofa bed.  Response: The MP said he been ""scrupulous"" in adhering to the rules, adding that he was ""confident that I have achieved the appropriate balance between seeking the support I need to perform my duties as MP for Wrexham, and responsible use of the allowances available to me"".  Claim: Ms Jones, an assistant government whip, claimed £87,647 on her London flat between 2004 and 2008, most of which was made up of mortgage interest payments.  Response: The Warrington MP told the Liverpool Daily Post: ""The fees office has said there is nothing in my expenses that they are concerned about.""  Claim: Ms Goodman claimed for a week's stay in a holiday cottage in her Bishop Auckland constituency over a bank holiday, the Daily Telegraph said.  It reported that she submitted a £519.31 claim to the fees office for the cottage in Romaldkirk, Teesdale, between 27 August and 3 September 2005.  Response: The MP - a government whip - told the BBC that she has a large, rural constituency and that before she had a house there she stayed in hotels or rented. During the summer 2005 recess, she wanted to work in the constituency for 10 days and it was cheaper to rent a cottage with her family than stay in a hotel. She worked every day of her stay and has the documentation to prove it, she added.  Claim: After splitting up with his wife, Mr Mahmood checked into a five-star London hotel with his then-girlfriend at taxpayers' expense.  The Daily Telegraph said the Birmingham Perry Barr MP used the Bentley in Kensington for nine nights over a four-week period in 2004 at a cost of £1,350.  He spent a further five nights there in 2008, claiming £1,225.  Response: Mr Mahmood said he had got the most deal possible for the taxpayer. ""I tried looking for other places and that was the best I could get,"" he told the Daily Telegraph. Mr Mahmood, who gave up his rented London flat in December 2008, said using hotels was cheaper than paying for properties that were unoccupied for much of the year.  The MP for South Derbyshire claimed £24,877 in expenses to refurbish his second home in London. Kitchen units, lighting, bathroom items, carpets, tiles leather chairs and a marble table were all among the goods for which he claimed.  Response: Mr Todd - who in 2007 announced his intention to stand down at the next election - said he would refund the fees office for an amount reflecting the items' depreciation when he retires.  Claim: Mr Clapham tried to claim £210 for a pair of glasses for his wife, Yvonne, who he employs as his office assistant, the Daily Telegraph said. But the fees office reduced his payment to £50, telling the Barnsley West & Penistone MP this was the maximum allowable for glasses. He also claimed £64 for dinner services and £19.97 for an iron.  Response: Mr Clapham points out that the dinner set was claimed on the wrong form and, although he was advised to resubmit it, he was too busy to do so. Consequently he never received the money and it will not appear on the official Commons expenses data when it is released.  Claim: The Leicester South MP claimed for bailiffs' fees after the rent on his constituency office fell into arrears. But the fees office said he was not liable for the £472.59 bill and refunded his claim.  Response: Sir Peter told the paper that the arrears were ""entirely the fees office's fault"" after they failed to process a bill.  Claim: The Derby North MP claimed £1,049 for a flat screen TV and £1,456 for a double bed in his London second home.  Response: Mr Laxton told the Telegraph that he ""didn't really particularly have the time to run around and get deals on a TV or beds"".  Claim: Mr Davies, who defected from the Conservatives to Labour, spent more than £10,000 repairing window frames at his 18th century mansion in Lincolnshire, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The defence minister - also MP for Grantham and Stamford - claimed close to the maximum allowable on second home expenses between 2004 and 2008.  Response: Mr Davies told the Telegraph that his expenses were ""entirely legitimate"" and that he had ""absolutely nothing to hide"". He insisted that the cost of upkeep on his home was considerably more than that for which he was reimbursed by the fees office.  Claim: The Oxford East MP claimed for renovations and repairs worth £30,000 on his south London home. Some of the invoices for the work, which included a new kitchen and bathroom, new windows and a hallway, were addressed to his constituency home.  Response: Mr Smith told the newspaper that he had kept to the spirit and letter of the rules, and that all goods claimed had been for the London property.  Ms Smith, elected MP for Sheffield Hillsborough in 2005, claimed for four beds for her one-bedroom London flat, the Daily Telegraph said. The paper reported that she kitted out her flat in 2005 with items at a cost of £7,800 including a king-size bed and two futons. Then in 2006 she bought a £950 sofa bed and a chair worth £550 because she said the futons were broken. Ms Smith also claimed hundreds of pounds for tax advice from Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn.  Response: Ms Smith told the newspaper that she had not claimed for home contents in 2008/9 and would not do so again. She added: ""Future replacement costs will be borne by myself."" In a joint statement with three other MPs, she said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue for 12 years.  Claim: The fees office rejected a £16.50 receipt submitted by Mr Levitt, the MP for High Peak, for the cost of a poppy wreath he laid during Remembrance Sunday commemorations. He was also asked to justify a £5,281 bill for renovations. This was granted, but the fees office refused to refund the full cost of fitting a bathroom at £8,013.77, the Daily Telegraph said. An examination of his previous mortgage interest payments by the fees office showed that he had over-claimed by £6,000, which he duly returned.  Response: Mr Levitt told the newspaper that the fees office was ""quite right"" to reject the poppy wreath claim. With regards to the bathroom, he said: """"The replacement was 'like for like' with the only 'enhancement' being a bathroom cupboard with a shaving mirror above the sink - there was not one there before. And labour costs in London are not cheap."" He added: ""As a former member of the Standards and Privileges Committee, my conscience is clear.""  Claim: Ms Munn's husband Dennis Bates was paid over £5,000 to provide tax advice to at least five ministers, the Daily Telegraph said. Ms Munn, the MP for Sheffield Heeley and a former Foreign Office minister, employs Mr Bates as her parliamentary assistant at taxpayers' expense. Ms Munn published her expenses claims on her website, but blacked out the section which showed she had paid her husband for tax advice tax using her expenses.  Response: Ms Munn has not yet commented. But in a statement, four of the ministers who received advice from her husband said Mr Bates, who worked at the Inland Revenue for 12 years, was ""eminently qualified"" to make sure MPs were meeting their liabilities.  Claim: Mr Knight, the schools minister and MP for Dorset South, was one of several MPs who paid Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn, from their parliamentary allowances for tax advice, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: Mr Knight told the BBC that Mr Bates's services were cheaper than than those of the previous accountant he had used. In a joint statement with three other MPs, Mr Knight said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue.  Claim: Mr Healey, the local government minister and MP for Wentworth in South Yorkshire, was one of several MPs who paid Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn, from their parliamentary allowances for tax advice, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: In a joint statement with three other MPs, Mr Healey said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue for 12 years.  Claim: Ms Merron, the foreign office minister and M for Lincoln, was one of several MPs who paid Dennis Bates, the husband of Labour MP Meg Munn, from their parliamentary allowances for tax advice, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: In a joint statement with three other MPs, Ms Merron said that Mr Bates was was ""eminently qualified"" to give them advice, having worked for the Inland Revenue for 12 years.  Claim: The former deputy leader of the Commons submitted receipts for £3,600 worth of electronic equipment. When the fees office questioned the claim for a TV, DVD player and digital radio in 2004, Mr Griffiths said that, as a Scottish MP, he needed to ""listen to Scottish radio"" and watch ""Scottish TV"".  The fees office turned down his request on the basis that the ""level of purchase"" remained under question.  Response: The Edinburgh South MP admitted that he had made the claim but that it had not been agreed.  ""I asked the fees office whether these items were refundable and was told to put the request in writing, which I did. The fees office came to the view that they were not eligible for funding.  ""None of the items were paid for out of any parliamentary allowance.""  Claim: The MP for Stockton-on-Tees claimed for a £5 donation that he made at a church service to commemorate the Battle of Britain. It was rejected by the House of Commons fees office.  Response: Mr Cook said he had ""no recollection"" of asking to be reimbursed, but accepted that the Telegraph would not have invented the claim and said it was ""wrong"" that it happened.  Claim: The MP for Dover and Deal paid his brother from his expenses to carry out work at his London flat, even though he lived almost 200 miles away. He also claimed for work done on another London property that he owned, although it was no longer his designated second home for three years and he was renting it out.  Response: Mr Prosser said that he had informed the fees office about employing his brother.  ""I phoned a number of London contractors and their estimates for the flooring job alone was more than £200 more than my brother's charge for the whole job so it was good value for money.""  On the subject of the other flat, the Labour backbencher said that he had done nothing wrong.  ""I was living in the flat when the notices were published and the work was carried out. Six months later I moved to my current flat. The invoices for payment should have been sent to me when I was still resident and had they done this my ACA claim would have been settled forthwith.""  Claim: The former Oscar-winning actress repaid £8,000 she claimed towards the publication of an annual report.  She agreed to pay back the money because of a reference to the Labour Party which is a breach of parliamentary rules.  Response: The MP for Hampstead and Highgate said she had not fully read the document and missed the mention of Labour.  ""I failed to proof read a line at the very end of the document which mentioned the party and I have paid back the money.""  Claim: The Telegraph says that the Labour backbencher made claims for a bath mat, gardening equipment and more than £7,000 for property repairs at his home in Birmingham, labelling them as office costs.  The Telegraph also suggests that Mr Godsiff claimed the maximum in second home expenses to cover the mortgage interest of his property in London.  Response: The Sparkbrook & Small Health MP says that he will check to see whether the report was correct.  ""If there is anything that shouldn't have been claimed for then I will gladly go through the files and check it out, and if there is anything inappropriate then I will make recompense.""  Mr Godsiff insists that all claims for his Birmingham home were approved by the fees office because it is also his office, where his secretary worked.  ""She [his secretary] has an office on the property. She also has storage space, where all the old files are kept. The fees office was aware of the arrangement right from the beginning.""  Claim: The Staffordshire Moorlands MP claimed more than £35,000 for renovations to her second home, which included £20,000 for windows and £4,000 for pulling down and rebuilding a chimney.  The parliamentary fees office disputed Miss Atkins claim, arguing that the request for the windows was ""beyond the definition for allowable work set out in the Green Book"" so she was not fully reimbursed.  Response: The Labour backbencher said that the property in Leeds did need some work. ""I bought my second home cheaply because it required some repair so my mortgage interest claim was low but my repair bill was high.""  Claim: The former transport minister got involved in a row with the fees office over claims he made for a baby cot and steriliser at his second home in London.  Having had his claims for the items rejected by the fees office, Mr Harris wrote to them arguing that ""MPs by necessity have to own two of almost everything"".  Response: The Glasgow South MP argues that his claim was valid because he only lives in London as part of his job as an MP.  Claim: The Telegraph reports that Mr Donohoe made a £2,575 claim for a three-piece sofa suite for his second home, designated as his London address, although the address on the invoice was his main home in Ayrshire.  Mr Donohoe produced another receipt with the London address and the fees office left it at that.  Response: The Central Ayrshire MP says that the items were intended for his second home.  ""The furniture was in fact delivered to London, and is in my current flat.""  Claim: The Daily Telegraph says Mr Ainsworth, MP for Coventry North East, submitted two invoices for £8,025 in 2005 for repair and redecoration of his second home in his constituency. Work carried out, according to the paper, included removing a wall, fitting oak beams in the ceiling, removing pipes next to the fireplace, preparing floors to be laminated, fitting pine doors and installing a gate. It says he also tried to claim for a £2,225 sofa and a £1,000 television but was told these were excessive. It adds that he switched his second home to a London flat in 2007.  Response: The armed forces minister said he was only reimbursed for necessary repair work - including removing a dangerous chimney, rewiring unsafe cables and fixing corrosive pipes - and paid for separate improvements out of his own pocket. All his claims were within the rules while he accepted the caps on the costs of the sofa and television.  Claim: Following inquiries by local media, the MP for Stafford raised concerns with the Commons authorities about his expenses claims for 2007-8. He was told that he had been overpaid for claims he made for council tax and water bills by £2,427.88. The Fees Office said it was ""extremely sorry"" for the situation which it said was caused by a ""number of errors"" within its operation.  Response: Mr Kidney said he was unaware of the discrepancy in his claims and ""horrified"" to learn of the Fees Office's mistakes. He has repaid the money.  Claim: The Plymouth Sutton MP met with the Commons authorities to discuss her claims and found ""significant changes"" would have to be made. It emerged she had been under-paid in some years and over-paid in others while some claims had been attributed to the wrong years.  Response: Ms Gilroy said she would repay £1,891 and submit her claims to the Commons committee on members' allowances. But she insisted she had not made any financial gains and, if anything, had been left ""out of pocket"".  Claim: The Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP attempted to claim £3,371 for furniture, including £768 for a Man Ray styling chair and £1,434 for a sofabed, but was refunded only £3,075, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: In a statement, Mr Ainger said: ""I have been in the lowest quarter of MPs for claims in each of the four years."" He has published his expenses on his website.  Claim: Mr Allen, MP for Nottingham North, claimed £495 for the service charge on his London flat and the maximum £400 monthly for food ""on most occasions"", the Telegraph said. His food claims were reduced when he attempted to claim more than £500 a month on two occasions, the paper added.  Response: On his website, Mr Allen says: ""The media constantly misrepresent the costs MPs need to do their jobs as 'expenses' - making people think that money is being paid into MPs' pockets. Electors who want to think for themselves cannot rely on the media: they need and deserve the truth."" He says he supports a range of reforms including a Parliamentary block of flats in London for MPs to live in and a ban on second and third jobs for MPs.  Claim: The Blaydon MP's mortgage interest costs totalled £1,203 by April 2006, the Telegraph said. It added that he claimed for furniture, a washing machine and a microwave, as well as between £200 and £400 each month for food.  Response: Mr Anderson has not responded to the report to date.  Claim: Ms Barlow, MP for Hove, used her second home allowance to spend more than £28,000 on stamp duty, legal costs and renovations despite telling the fees office that the property would become her main home, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: Ms Barlow told the newspaper that the fees office asked if she intended to make the Hove address her main home. ""I said that I probably would do so which I did after the move to Hove was concluded,"" she added. ""I was advised to claim for the cost of moving into the Hove home."" She added that the move took time because her children went to school in Chichester and that she had stopped claiming Additional Costs Allowance in October 2006.  Claim: Mr Barron claimed a London flat in 2004/5 as his second home with a monthly mortgage interest of £1,509, which rose to £1,791 in 2005/6, the Daily Telegraph said. This increased in to more than £2,000 the following year.  Response: To date the Rother Valley MP has not responded to the report.  Claim: The Leeds West MP claim the maximum £400 a month food allowance after consulting with the fees office, the Daily Telegraph said. He also claimed £499 for a dark brown sofa and £599 for a recliner.  Response: Mr Battle has not responded to the report.  Claim: Mr Bayley, MP for the City of York, said a flat in London rather than York was his second home and claimed £1,177 monthly mortgage interest, the Daily Telegraph said. Later, he nominated York as second home, the paper added.  Response: Mr Bayley has not responded to the report.  Claim: Ms Begg spent £1,403 on furniture for the living room of her London flat and £500 on Devonshire carpets for two bedrooms, the Daily Telegraph said. It also reported that the Aberdeen South MP claimed £85,245 over four years.  Response: On her website, Ms Begg wrote: ""I feel confident that, as well as not breaking any rules, I have also acted in an ethical and responsible manner.""  Claim: Sir Stuart claimed £750 for food in December 2005, reduced to the maximum monthly amount of £400, according to the Daily Telegraph. He claimed £1,400 a month rent on his second home, a flat in London, the paper also reported.  Response: The Middlesbrough MP told the Journal newspaper that his claims were ""perfectly reasonable"".  Claim: The Bootle MP claimed £400 a month for food during the 2005 summer recess, according to the Daily Telegraph. In 2008 spent £1,500 repairing his second home, the paper reported.  Response: Mr Benton has not commented on the report.  Claim: The Kingswood MP's expenses for his London second home included a £696 Sony 26-inch LCD TV, a £250 DVD player, a £1067.49 washer-dryer, and a dishwasher costing £574.28, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Response: Mr Berry told the Bristol Evening Post: ""I believe that I have been reasonable but I think there should be a completely independent group of people that go through every MP's expenses. They should have the power to order MPs to pay back anything they think is unreasonable and if they decided any of mine were, I would gladly do that.""  Claim: The MP for Sheffield Attercliffe claimed £1,268 for carpets, £689.99 for a television, £1,135.20 for a bed, £570 for a sofa bed; £1,220 on furniture and £1,433.50 on decoration, the Daily Telegraph said.  Response: On his website, Mr Betts said: ""My intention, in submitting any claims, has been to comply with the spirit as well as the words of any rules and guidance.""  Claim: The City of Durham MP claimed £9,425.19 in stamp duty and other costs incurred buying a London flat and subsequently claimed £1,364.29 monthly for mortgage interest payments.  Response: Ms Blackman-Woods said her mortgage interest payments cost the taxpayer less than renting in central London. In a statement on her website, she added: ""I have always been open, honest and transparent about the expenses and allowances I have claimed since serving as Durham's MP. I have had details of my expenses on my website for many years.""  Claim: Mr Blizzard, MP for Waveney, claims £1,278.25 each month for mortgage interest payments on his London second home, the Daily Telegraph said. It added that he ""made few other claims"", one of which was £363 for a washing machine.  Response: Mr Blizzard wrote on his website that ""all of the money I have claimed from the 'second homes' allowances relates to the cost of living in London"".  Claim: The two Labour ministers have claimed more than £100,000 for a shared London flat since May 2005, according to the Telegraph. The ministers each claimed for their share of the legal costs involved in purchasing the property and then later for the fees to buy the freehold.  Response: Neither has yet responded. Tom Watson stood down as a minister on 5 June, saying the the ""pressure on my young family has been painful"" during his time in office.  Three cabinet members in particular are singled out for their ""modest"" claims under the second homes allowance by the Telegraph. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband had only put in claims for £6,300 a year in rent for his constituency home and for utility and council tax bills. Health Secretary Alan Johnson rented a ""modest"" property but claimed for food and some furniture. Environment Secretary Hilary Benn claimed only £147.78 for food from the allowance which allows MPs to claim up to about £24,000 a year.  Laura Moffat, the Labour backbencher whose Crawley seat is the most marginal in the country, was singled out for praise by the Daily Telegraph. She gave up her flat overlooking the Thames for a camp bed in her office because she did not feel comfortable charging taxpayers for her rent.  Chris Mullin, MP for Sunderland South, gets by with a black and white TV. He claimed the reduced £45 licence fee on his second homes allowance.  Birkinhead MP and possible candidate for the Speaker's chair Frank Field claimed just £9,573 for his constituency home."
522,"There has been a direct bomb attack on the British Government at the Conservative party conference in Brighton.  At least two people have been killed and many others seriously injured, including two senior Cabinet ministers.  The blast tore apart the Brighton Grand Hotel where members of the Cabinet have been staying for the Conservative party conference.  The IRA has issued a statement claiming it had placed a 100lb bomb in the hotel.  The statement read: ""Today we were unlucky, but remember, we only have to be lucky once; you will have to be lucky always. Give Ireland peace and there will be no war.""  The dead have not yet been named. Among the injured were Trade and Industry Secretary Norman Tebbit, his wife Margaret and Government Chief Whip, John Wakeham.  Firemen used BBC arc lights after cables were cut to rescue Mr Tebbit from the rubble, in a painstaking operation that took several hours.  Breakfast television showed pictures of the rescue and a conscious Mr Tebbit, clearly in pain, being stretchered to safety. His wife suffered neck injuries.  The bomb went off at 0254 local time, ripping open the front of the hotel on the top floors and sending masonry crashing down on guests sleeping below.  Fireman say many lives were probably saved because the well-constructed Victorian hotel remained standing, despite the central section of eight floors collapsing into the basement.  At Mrs Thatcher's insistence the conference opened on schedule at 0930. In her redrafted speech to the party she declared:  ""This attack has failed. All attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.""  The Queen was said to be ""very shocked"" by the bombing. Opposition Leader Neil Kinnock expressed his ""horror and outrage"".  Meanwhile security in the seaside town has been massively increased as rescue workers continue to search for people trapped in the rubble.  Detectives are now beginning a major investigation into who was behind the bombing and how such a major breach in security occurred."
523,"The UK government has said it will consider helping Port Talbot steelworks - but any intervention risks falling foul of European Union state aid rules.  The EU does not allow state support of a business if it would distort competition in the single market.  The final decision on whether state aid is allowed is down to the European Commission.  It applies rules agreed by every country in the EU.  But the steel industry is a special case.  Because the European Union already produces more steel than it needs, the member states of the EU agreed to allow uneconomical producers to go bust, rather than let governments save them.  So that is the first question for Port Talbot and the other parts of Tata Steel UK - can they survive on their own? If they can't then the government's hands are tied.  There are some ways round the rules.  The first is national security. Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome, one of the founding treaties of the EU, countries can ""take any measures necessary"" if an industry is essential to national security.  This is supposed to refer to arms, munitions and ""war material"". Does it apply to hot rolled steel? Legal experts think it's unlikely, although Lord West, the former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff has told the BBC that UK production is vital for the defence sector.  The second is a move to avoid ""a serious disturbance to the economy"". This was one of the arguments used to justify the bank bailouts.  It might also be used to justify aid to the Greek banking system.  But the loss of 15,000 UK jobs - or even 40,000 UK and European jobs - may simply not be considered a serious enough disturbance by the European Commission to justify a government handout.  The last option isn't state aid at all. A government can own a company under state aid rules but it is not allowed to keep it going if it would otherwise fail.  This is the closest the government can come to ""nationalisation"".  If the government can convince the European Commission that buying a business is a sensible move that any investor would make for a profit then it is not classified as state aid.  However with Port Talbot reportedly losing £1 million a day this may be a tough sell.  State aid is not banned in the European Union, but it is tightly controlled, and in 2008 the banks met the necessary criteria for a bailout.  As well as being vital for the stability of the economy, it was generally accepted that the UK banking sector had a profitable future.  The aim of the EU state aid rules is to ensure any government intervention produces a sustainable independent industry.  As far as the rules are concerned, it is hard to make that argument for the UK steel industry.  However, in the coming weeks many people will be doing just that, and adding that it is the government's role to provide a bridge - of some sort - to a sustainable future for UK steel."
524,"Choir that sings to the world   BBC News Online's Alex Webb reports on the enduring appeal of the King's College Carol Concert - which began as a way of keeping men out of the pub on Christmas Eve. ""It's a service, not a concert,"" the music office of King's College is keen to point out. And therein, perhaps, lies the secret of the event's success. At a time of year when there are carol concerts everywhere, the King's College Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols - to give it its proper name - is still something special.    We're delighted to share this event with so many people    Special enough to be bought by broadcasters around the world and to be syndicated to more than 300 radio stations in the US alone, thanks to an arrangement with Minneapolis Public Radio. And, via the BBC World Service, the service can be heard from New Zealand to Nigeria, and from Barbados to Bangladesh. ""It's still enormously satisfying,"" King's College director of music Stephen Cleobury tells BBC News Online. ""When three o'clock comes on Christmas Eve, people hear the voice singing Once In Royal David's City, and they feel Christmas is beginning."" The service, which is broadcast live on Christmas Eve at 1500 on BBC Radio 4, was first held on Christmas Eve 1918. Its genesis was in a wooden hut in Truro, Cornwall, where since the 1880s the Christmas Eve service had consisted of nine carols alternating with nine lessons - read by an ascending series of church figures, starting with a chorister and ending with a bishop. The rather humble purpose of the service was to keep men away out of pubs on Christmas Eve. The new-style service was introduced to King's by the college's new Dean, Eric Milner-White, who served as an army chaplain during World War I. His experiences with rank-and-file soldiers convinced him that the Church of England needed to make its worship more accessible, and he saw the Festival of Lessons and Carols as a step in that direction. The service was broadcast by the BBC for the first time in 1928 and soon became an annual fixture - even during the war years, when the chapel's glass had all been removed and the name of King's could not be broadcast for security reasons. The King's College choir was founded by Henry VI and has been in existence longer than the chapel building itself, which was completed in 1547. The line-up of 16 boy choristers has stayed at the same numbers since 1440, and is supported by the adult voices of King's College undergraduates. The Festival has boosted the reputation of the choir enormously, leading to regular foreign tours and, since 1927, many commercial recordings. Many ex-choristers have gone on to be influential figures in the music world, including Roy Goodman, renowned for his performance as treble soloist in a legendary recording of the Allegri Miserere, who has since made his name as a conductor. The baritone Gerald Finley, countertenor Michael Chance and tenor Robert Tear are all in the front rank of international soloists, and five of the original King's Singers met at King's. But the Festival of Lessons and Carols remains bigger than any of the constituent parts. It is an event which yearly breathes new life into the extraordinary stone-vaulted chapel, which architect GE Kidder Smith described as ""one of the great rooms in architecture"". ""It is a most remarkable building, and has a very special acoustic - but it's even more remarkable on Christmas Eve,"" says Mr Cleobury. ""In the chapel you get a great, a palpable sense of anticipation before the service."" For Christmas Eve this year listeners can look forward to three specially written poems by Michael Symmons Roberts and pieces by Bruckner and Tavener. And of course, there will be the carols, which by tradition begin with a lone choirboy singing the first verse of the carol Once In Royal David's City, unaccompanied. ""We're delighted to share this event with so many people,"" says Mr Cleobury. ""We get interesting and moving letters about it, especially from British people who find themselves abroad at Christmas."" King's College Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols is broadcast on Christmas Eve at 1500 on BBC Radio 4, and at 1650 on BBC Two."
525,"Early morning planes arriving at Heathrow are being directed to more defined flight paths, in a trial aimed at giving residents respite from noise.  The aim is to protect people in dedicated areas from unpredictable aircraft noise between 04:30 and 06:00.  Normally the flight paths into the airport are spread across London.  The scheme is a partnership between Heathrow, British Airways, the National Air Traffic Service and HACAN, which campaigns against aircraft noise.  On average about 17 flights arrive at Heathrow each morning between 04:30 and 06:00.  Air traffic controllers normally direct these aircraft to achieve the safest and most efficient arrival routes, spreading out their flight paths.  The Early Morning Noise Respite Trial will look at whether the flights, in particular those at the beginning of their approach into Heathrow, can be routed in a more defined way.  The trial will work by defining two zones over each trial area. Each zone will take turns to be active on a weekly basis.  Pilots will be directed by air traffic control to avoid flying through whichever zone is active for that particular week.  Matt Gorman, Heathrow's sustainability director, said: ""A relatively small adjustment in terms of the flight path can have a big impact on those living underneath it.""  HACAN chairman John Stewart said: ""Periods of respite are very important for residents under the flight paths. We welcome this initiative.""  Whether the aircraft land from the east or west depends on the wind direction, so there will be four trial areas, two to the east of the airport and two to the west.  These areas cover places such as Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Battersea, Clapham Common, Westminster, Bermondsey and Streatham to the east of the airport, and Binfield, Reading, Purley-on-Thames and Winnersh to the west of the airport.  The trial will run for five months."
526,"The 30-year-old, who has joined for the rest of the season, made his debut for the Reds as an 18-year-old in 1993.  He scored a total of 171 goals in 330 games before joining Leeds for £11m in 2001 and then Man City for £6m in 2003.  ""He's got a wealth of experience and gives us more attacking options. He's different to the other strikers we have,"" said Reds boss Rafael Benitez.  ""We have signed a player with so much passion for this football club and I think he will act as an example to every player here in how much he loves Liverpool.  ""I'm not sure I've ever seen a player quite so happy to be joining a club before.  ""He hasn't been signed because he loves the club; he's been signed because he's one of the best goalscorers ever to play in the Premiership and he can score goals for us right now.  ""We have signed a player with a passion and a heart for this club that no amount of money can buy. We are close to a very high level right now but with Robbie we can go even higher.""  Fowler said he was delighted to be given the chance to return Anfield.  ""Since I have left, deep down I have always wanted to come back and it has been a long time but I'm glad to say I'm back now,"" said Fowler.  ""Leaving was probably one of my biggest regrets I have had in football.  ""I'm chuffed to bits. I mean, I can't really believe it's happened again so I'm ecstatic to be honest.""  City boss Stuart Pearce said he did not want to stand in the way of Fowler returning to Anfield.  ""If I refused him this opportunity of fulfilling his ambition it would not be good for him or Manchester City Football Club,"" Pearce told the City website.  Former City boss Kevin Keegan spent £6m to take him away from Leeds in February 2003.  Injuries hampered his career at Eastlands, but he recently scored a hat-trick against Scunthorpe in the third round of the FA Cup.  And he also scored against Manchester United in City's 3-1 derby victory.  In his autobiography Fowler claimed he was forced to leave Liverpool because of his treatment by Benitez's predecessor Gerard Houllier, while his Anfield career was marked by various disciplinary problems.  He had a training ground squabble with Liverpool assistant manager Phil Thompson as well as an argument with teammate Neil Ruddock left him with a nose injury.  Fowler also had an on-field fight with Chelsea's Graeme Le Saux after making obscene gestures towards the England international.  The striker is not eligible to play in Sunday's FA Cup tie against Portsmouth but could make his comeback in Wednesday's home game with Birmingham.  Whether Fowler is offered a contract extension will be reviewed at the end of the season."
527,"Anthony Sawoniuk, 84, was serving two life sentences after being found guilty of murdering 18 Jews in the UK's first war crimes trial.  The former British Rail ticket collector was found guilty in 1999 of crimes committed in his home town of Domachevo, Belarus.  He lost an appeal against his conviction in 2000.  Police said Sawoniuk was believed to have died of natural causes and his death was not being treated as suspicious.  He was tried at the Old Bailey, London, and jailed for his role in the Nazi genocide in eastern Europe after more than 50 years at liberty.  Sawoniuk, who moved to the UK after the war, sealed his own fate with a letter written in the early 1950s to his half-brother Mikolai in Poland.  At the time, all mail from the West was vetted by the KGB, which already had Sawoniuk on its records of possible war criminals who had escaped abroad.  As the Soviet Union began to break down in the mid-1980s the list was submitted to British authorities.  However, Sawoniuk's name had been spelled wrong. Only in 1993, when the names were reviewed, did it emerge that one of the men on the KGB records had moved to Britain.  By the 1990s Sawoniuk had retired after an unremarkable routine of 25 years working as a ticket collector for British Rail, and living in Bermondsey, south London.  He had slipped into the UK under the guise of a Polish patriot after switching sides late on in the conflict.  Sawoniuk was born on 7 March 1921, in the harsh climate of Domachevo. As a boy he would have starved if it were not for the generosity of local wealthy Jewish families.  But when the Germans arrived in 1941, he took up with the Nazi police force to help with the suppression and genocide of local Jews.  During his trial, the jury heard from an eyewitness how he watched Sawoniuk tell two men and a woman to strip beside an open grave and then shot them.  The court also heard how he mowed down 15 people with a submachine gun and pushed their bodies into an open grave.  The jury travelled to Belarus to visit the scenes during the trial.  In February 2005 Sawoniuk was transferred to Norwich Prison from Kingston Jail in Portsmouth and was held in a unit for elderly life prisoners.  A police spokeswoman said a normal coroner's inquiry would now take place."
528,"He wants copyright to last 95 years, rather than the present 50 years.  But an independent review is to recommend the terms are not extended, a well-placed government source has said.  This outcome would mean the report had ""missed a great opportunity"" to support the music industry, the chairman of the British Phonographic Industry claimed.  ""There can be no rationale for discriminating against performing artists - a vital part of the creative mix,"" said Peter Jamieson.  ""Nor can it be possible to justify disadvantaging Britain and Europe in the global music market.  ""The sound recording is as important a copyright as musical composition and film, and deserves a similar lifespan.""  If the findings of the report, commissioned by the Treasury, were backed by the government, Sir Cliff's earliest tracks would start to come out of copyright in 2008.  His first big hit was Move It, recorded in 1958, when he was hailed as the British Elvis.  The Beatles would also be in a similar situation from 2012, the 50th anniversary of their first hit single, Love Me Do.  Music journalist Neil McCormack told BBC Radio Five Live that this outcome would be a blow to the industry.  ""This was set before the advent, the big boom, of rock 'n' roll - the boom in popular culture which has led to a whole vast number of people making their living from these royalties.  John Kennedy, the chairman of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, predicted the Treasury would be forced to decide ""whether or not it wants to support one of its successful industries"".  ""If the UK government decides not to support copyright equalisation, then the music industry will have to continue its campaign in Europe,"" he said.  ""There, the signs are encouraging, but there is no doubt that there will be raised eyebrows.""  People would ask why Europe should help the music industry when the government of the ""most important music market in Europe"" had decided not to, Mr Kennedy added.  The situation applies only to recording artists as composers and their families retain copyright on musical scores until 70 years after the author's death.  The copyright review was conducted for Chancellor Gordon Brown by Andrew Gowers, a former editor of the Financial Times.

529,"The consumer products giants Unilever and Procter & Gamble (P&G) have been fined 315m euros (£280m, $456m) for fixing washing powder prices in eight European countries.  It follows a three-year investigation by the European Commission following a tip-off by the German company, Henkel.  Unilever sells Omo and Surf, P&G makes Tide, and Henkel sells Persil in certain European countries.  The fines were discounted by 10% after the two admitted running a cartel.  Unilever was fined 104m euros and P&G was fined 211.2m euros.  Henkel was not fined in return for providing the tip-off.  The EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement: ""By acknowledging their participation in the cartel, the companies enabled the Commission to swiftly conclude its investigation.""  The cartel operated in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands between 2002 to 2005, the regulator said.  P&G, the world's largest consumer products group, owns the Tide, Gain and Era brands of washing powder while the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever makes detergent products under the brand names Omo and Surf.  Henkel owns the Persil brand in most of Europe, while Unilever owns it in Britain, Ireland and France.  The EU watchdog raided the three companies in June 2008 on suspicion of price fixing, and also sought information from the US-based household products firm Sara Lee.  Unilever has already set aside an undisclosed sum to cover any fine."
530,"Google's Motorola unit has launched a relatively low-cost smartphone that includes features more commonly found in higher-priced models.  The Moto G will be sold contract-free from £135 in the UK and $179 in the US.  The handset has a 4.5in (11.4cm) 720p high-definition screen, a five megapixel rear camera, a 1.3MP front one, and runs the latest versions of the Android operating system.  Analysts suggests the budget end of the market is set to enjoy huge growth.  ""The second wave of smartphone adopters is now starting,"" said Francisco Jeronimo, a mobile device analyst at the consultancy IDC.  ""This wave is characterised by consumers looking to get their first smartphone at the cheapest price they find.  ""They don't have the need nor the money to afford the most advanced smartphones, as the first wave of adopters had. ""  The Moto G - which supports 3G but not 4G networks - is being launched in 30 countries including the UK, US, France, Germany and parts of Latin America and Asia. That contrasts with the country's last model - the Moto X - which is currently only available in the US.  Its price makes it slightly cheaper than Samsung's Galaxy S3 Mini, HTC's Desire X and Sony's Xperia M but still more expensive than Huawei's Ascend G510.  However, Motorola's device is the only one of these to come preinstalled with the Android Jelly Bean operating system. The firm is also promising to release an upgrade to the newest version of its Android platform, KitKat, in the near future.  It also has the highest resolution display and is the only one to feature a quad-core, rather than dual-core, CPU (central processing unit). This should in theory allow it to offer superior processing power while minimising the toll on battery life.  Motorola's chief executive told the BBC it had helped cut each handset's cost by putting in a large orders for their components from the start.  ""The engineers also designed this for cost - there's fewer pieces [and] it's designed to be easy and fast to assemble,"" said Dennis Woodside.  He added that unlike the Moto X, the company had opted not to build the device in the US.  ""It's assembled in China, Brazil and Argentina,"" he said. ""We had to go with a cost-driven approach to put it together.""  Mr Woodside said the handset would be targeted at three groups:  Motorola is far from alone in targeting these segments.  Nokia's Lumia 520 - running on Microsoft's Windows Phone 8 platform - can be purchased contract-free for £100. The firm also offers the even cheaper Asha range of phones, which run a more limited choice of apps.  ZTE has released a smartphone powered by Mozilla's Firefox OS costing just £60.  Meanwhile, Xiaomi recently released Hongmi, a handset costing the equivalent of £80. Like the Moto G it runs Android Jelly Bean and has a quad-core CPU, but in addition offers a bigger screen and higher megapixel rear camera.  For now Xiaomi is focused on China, but the company's recent hire of Hugo Barra - a former Google executive - has been interpreted by many as signalling international ambitions.  According to a recent study by network equipment maker Ericsson, the number of smartphone subscribers will grow from 1.9 billion people today to 5.6 billion by 2019.  But despite an expanding market, Motorola has struggled.  In the July-to-September quarter its losses totalled $248m - 24% up from the same period in 2012.  Its US market share also fell over the same months, according to research company Comscore, despite the Moto X's launch.  ""Although most vendors are still trying to enter the high-end of the market attracted by higher margins, they struggle to compete with Apple and Samsung, due their strong brands and colossal marketing budgets,"" said Mr Jeronimo.  ""The mid- and the low-end of the market is where most companies are turning to to grow their handsets businesses.  ""However, competing at lower price points represents a huge challenge for the less innovative manufacturers or those that are not efficient enough to squeeze each penny from their supply chain.""  Google has the potential to earn money from Android handsets by taking a cut from apps and media sold via its Play Store, and adverts shown on its other apps.  Even so, Mr Woodside said Motorola intended to make a ""fair profit"" from the Moto G, adding that he believed the new model had the potential to prove more popular than the Moto X.  ""It really addresses a larger market, frankly,"" he said.  ""That's where the volume is. I don't want to give any specific forecasts but the opportunity is absolutely much bigger."""
531,"     Water management officials said the spill, believed to contain heavy metals, had dyed the river black for at least 20 kilometres.      The news came as Hungarian, Romanian and Ukrainian officials began talks in Debrecen in eastern Hungary to discuss the pollution of the region.     Serious situation      Hungary had been warned about the spill by Ukraine, through which the Tisza passes before entering Hungarian territory.      Hungarian radio quoted catastrophe prevention official Sandor Istenes as saying it was caused by the breach of a reservoir dyke at mining works in Baia Borsa, northern Romania.    The same mining works were responsible for a spill into the river last week of 20,000 cubic metres of sludge containing zinc, lead and copper.      Hungary has asked Romania to identify and, if necessary, close industrial plants that pose a serious danger to the environment.      It has also asked the European Union to help identify hazardous sites in Romania and either help improve them or close them down.      Deputy State Secretary Gabor Bagi summoned the Romanian Ambassador Petru Cordos on Tuesday to warn him the situation was ""extraordinary and serious"".     Emergency measures      The Hungarian authorities have reimplemented the emergency measures put into practice after the previous spills.      These include banning the use of river water for any purpose, including irrigation.      They have also sealed off side tributaries of the Tisza and the Tisza Lake, in an effort to protect them from pollution.      In January, a spill of sludge laced with cyanide from another mine in Romania entered the river, killing some 200 tons of fish.      The spills have been described as the most serious environmental disaster to hit eastern Europe since the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant nearly 15 years ago.      A new pollution spill from Romania has entered the River Tisza in Hungary - the third such spill in six weeks.Water management officials said the spill, believed to contain heavy metals, had dyed the river black for at least 20 kilometres.The news came as Hungarian, Romanian and Ukrainian officials began talks in Debrecen in eastern Hungary to discuss the pollution of the region.Hungary had been warned about the spill by Ukraine, through which the Tisza passes before entering Hungarian territory.Hungarian radio quoted catastrophe prevention official Sandor Istenes as saying it was caused by the breach of a reservoir dyke at mining works in Baia Borsa, northern Romania."
532,"Scotland Yard has hailed the security operation surrounding the royal wedding as an ""amazing success"" despite 55 arrests around its security zone.  About half the arrests were for breach of the peace and a man was held for an alleged sex assault on a girl, aged 14.  Ten people carrying climbing gear and anti-monarchy placards were arrested near Charing Cross.  Other arrests were for drunk and disorderly, criminal damage, theft and over a suspected environmental protest.  Three people were held in the Covent Garden area over the alleged demonstration, police said.  Anti-terror powers were used to arrest one man who was seen taking suspicious photographs of transport hubs and security personnel in the Charing Cross area.  Three others were held over drug offences and four for allegedly carrying an offensive weapon.  Met Police Assistant Commissioner Lynne Owens said the success of the overall policing operation showed that the force could handle security for next year's Olympic Games.  She said her 5,000 officers should be ""immensely proud"" of their role in the ""happy and safe"" event.  She admitted to pre-event ""nerves"" and defended the decision to carry out a string of pre-event raids as ""entirely justified"".  An estimated one million people had gathered along the wedding route.  The police said that number was more than expected.  Officers questioned masked anti-monarchy protesters in Soho Square as a huge security operation took place around Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and The Mall.  Thousands of police officers created a ""ring of steel"" around the venues. Snipers took to rooftops and undercover officers mingled among the crowds  More than 90 people were banned from the area and up to 80 VIPs were granted personal protection.  Over the past few days police have arrested three people believed to be planning to behead effigies at the wedding.  They were detained by police in Brockley, south-east London, on Thursday night.  There were also several raids on squats across London, which drew criticism from one Labour backbencher.  John McDonnell accused police of ""disproportionate"" action, saying the raids appeared to be ""some form of pre-emptive strike"".  Elsewhere, anti-monarchy group Republic held a peaceful ""not the royal wedding"" street party in Red Lion Square, Holborn."
533,"Fighting began around the stadium almost two hours before kick-off A man has been stabbed in the chest during ""large-scale trouble"" involving hundreds of fans at West Ham's Carling Cup match against Millwall. Fights broke out at 1800 BST and were still raging five hours later. A 44-year-old man is stable after being stabbed in Priory Road at 2025 BST. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said missiles had been thrown at officers but none were injured. By 2300 BST several hundred West Ham fans had congregated outside the stadium chanting and bombarding police with crates and bottles. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The first pitch invasion was after West Ham's equaliser, while the second more serious invasion happened after they scored a penalty. It took officials about six minutes to clear about 50 people from the pitch and police had to redeploy within the stadium to tackle the invasion. West Ham won the game 3-1 after extra time, upon which there was a third invasion by hundreds of fans. About 200 riot police and at least 20 mounted officers were at the ground and a police helicopter circled the area. The Press Association quoted an unnamed 19-year-old saying he saw a police officer being kicked on the ground. The police spokesman said: ""There is large-scale trouble involving hundreds of fans which we are dealing with at the moment. About 50 fans invaded the pitch after West Ham equalised ""Officers are now containing it but there is still disorder. Hundreds of fans are estimated to be involved."" One pub reportedly had its windows broken by bricks during running battles across several streets up to half a mile from the stadium. Eyewitnesses told of hooligans trying to rip out bollards and lighting ""small fires"". Five arrests have been confirmed, including one for affray and one for breaching a banning order. BBC radio reporter Ben Jacobs, who was at the stadium, said: ""The trouble broke out outside the Tube station about 600 yards from the ground. ""There were [hundreds of] riot police and Millwall fans managed to break through the divide."" Tony, a steward at the game, told BBC Radio 5 live they were powerless to stop the violence. He said: ""When you have 2,900 Millwall fans it is really intimidating. ""There is not a lot you can do - you have to hope the police presence can help you out."" There were loads of people with bloodied faces    A 29-year-old man had to close his kebab shop in nearby Green Street for two hours. He said: ""All hell broke loose - it was very frightening. ""Bottles and bricks were being thrown from the back and some were hitting West Ham fans at the front. ""There were loads of people with bloodied faces."" Aaron Smith, from Hemel Hempstead, who was at the game, said: ""I saw one man cornered by at least a dozen Millwall fans before kick-off. Terrifying scenes."" And a Millwall fan told the BBC: ""It was like a war zone outside the stadium. There was fighting all round. ""I brought my kids with me tonight and they've seen some violence that is indescribable."" A Football Association spokesman said: ""We absolutely condemn the disorder. ""We expect all culprits to be banned from football for life - they have no place in our game.""     "
534,"The salt trade is seen as a necessary part of tradition in parts of Mali    With a long, gurgling groan, Lakhmar fell awkwardly to his knees in the roasting hot sand outside the town of Timbuktu. For the past six years he has been making the same gruelling trek across the Sahara desert to the salt mines of Taoudenni in northern Mali. But each journey is becoming more of a struggle. Lakhmar, a 10-year-old male camel with a metal ring in his flaring right nostril, left it to his owner, Boujima Handak, to explain their predicament. Whenever I see a lorry take the salt I am very upset    ""It's getting more difficult because the rains aren't coming, the oases are drying up and the camels get tired and thirsty and can't continue,"" he said, unloading a grey-brown, 50kg slab of crystallised salt, the size of an ironing board, from Lakhmar's back. Camel caravans have been plying their trade between Taoudenni and Timbuktu for centuries. It is a rite of passage for young, blue-turbaned nomads from the local Tuareg community. The miners themselves work for six months at a time, in one of the planet's hottest and most forbidding environments. They use homemade wooden clubs to carve the blocks of salt from the dried-up bed of an ancient lake. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. But today a changing climate, and the arrival of modern technology, is threatening the future of one of the world's oldest and most resilient trading traditions. Towards dusk, a muffled roar escaped from a mud-walled compound on the dusty outskirts of Timbuktu. Inside, Sheik Ould Bekay was issuing orders to half a dozen men who had nearly finished loading a flat-bed truck with provisions for the trip to Taoudenni. Mr Bekay used to do the same journey in a caravan of more than 200 camels. It took 45 days to make the round-trip; by truck he can do it in 10 days - provided his gearbox does not fail again. ""I don't want to use a truck but my camels just couldn't cope any more carrying 200 kilos of salt and with not enough rain,"" he said. Four years ago, he sold all but a handful of his camels and bought a truck. Many of his colleagues have followed suit. The trucks have now taken over more than half of the trade, and because they can carry so much more their profits have soared, enabling Mr Bekay to build himself a two-storey stone and mud house. Trucks are quicker and more efficient but not as picturesque In Timbuktu's salt market the blocks (occasionally stained brown with camel's blood from the long journey) are sawn down into smaller chunks to be sold locally or sent onwards whole by truck or camel to southern Mali and beyond. The salt trade used to be a buyer's market - with the miners forced to wait for months at a time for the next camel convoy to arrive. But the arrival of lorries has changed the balance of power and the salt miners are now charging more. Prices have doubled in the past two years. ""Whenever I see a lorry take the salt I am very upset,"" said Halis al-Hassane, who has run camel caravans for the past decade. He acknowledges that ""we really have no choice because every year the drought is becoming more difficult."" But he worries about the impact it will have on the region's nomadic culture. ""For Tuareg, the salt caravan is not something just for money, it is tradition,"" he explained. ""If in your life you do not do it once or twice you are not considered Tuareg. So for me [the trucks mean] the end of Tuareg culture. I am not saying the camels will disappear, because some Tuareg will always stay in the desert and travel for other reasons, but I'm very worried that in three to five years all the salt caravans will be by truck.""

535,"Relatives of more than 330 people who died in the siege accuse the security services of incompetence.  They say the police who stormed the school should shoulder the blame for as many deaths as the hostage-takers.  An earlier report by the local parliamentary commission did find the security services had been incompetent.  The BBC's Artyom Liss in Moscow says the prosecutors' report, released on Monday, will probably infuriate relatives of those who died in Beslan - but it does not come as a surprise.  In September 2004, more than 300 people were killed when mines planted by the hostage-takers inside the school began to explode and police and troops stormed the building.  Since then people in Beslan have demanded that the authorities be called to account.  The prosecutors' view of events is very different to the findings of the local parliamentary commission.  Deputy Prosecutor-General Nikolay Shepel told Interfax news agency the security forces had all acted strictly within the law, and a reconstruction of the events did not uncover any actions that could have provoked the tragedy.  ""According to the conclusions of the investigation, the expert commission did not find ... any infringements which could have a causal link to the harmful consequences which resulted from the terrorist act in Beslan,"" he said.  But, Mr Shepel added, the experts had concluded that the existing system for preventing terrorism did not provide full protection for the country's population.  ""This manifests itself in an inability to discover, warn of and prevent terrorist attacks in good time,"" he said.  Our correspondent says that for victims of the siege all this is little consolation. Dozens of them, who have formed the group known as the Mothers of Beslan, have already accused the prosecutors of trying to whitewash the generals responsible.  They say they do not trust the authorities and promise to continue their own investigation."
536,"The high-speed rail link - HS2 - promises to cut journey times and relieve congestion on the West Coast Main Line.  But the full scale of what London would face during the construction is only gradually emerging.  While most of the route in London will be underground, most of west London's Ealing will have HS2 on the surface.  The impact of building it could be severe. Ealing Council says 18 bridges will have to be replaced due to HS2, and the Hanger Lane gyratory replaced.  Hanger Lane is one of the busiest intersections in London. Nearly 10,000 vehicles an hour pass through there at rush hour.  Clearly that would cause huge disruption.  In total the bridges that would be replaced will be:  The council is, with some caveats, supportive of HS2 but wants Ealing to be tunnelled under.  It puts the cost at £150m.  Local campaigners do not want HS2 at all, but if they have to get it they want a subterranean solution.  HS2 Ltd obviously realises the council has a point and is now carrying out a tunnelling feasibility study.  What will be difficult for the company to answer is, why is nearly everywhere else in London deemed suitable for a tunnel and not Ealing?  If areas such as Ruislip, where residents campaigned successfully for the route to go underground, why not Ealing?  Ealing, run by a Labour council, is more densely populated than Ruislip, which is in the jurisdiction of the Tory-led Hillingdon Council, and many will begin to wonder if politics is coming into play.  A spokesman for HS2 Ltd said: ""Our contractors are undertaking a study looking at the effects of building a tunnel through Ealing compared with using the existing rail alignment next to the Central Line - taking into account the environmental impact and cost.  ""We expect to have the preliminary report from our engineering contractors by the end of October.  Ultimately the decision will be made by the secretary of state for transport.''  Certainly replacing 18 bridges in Ealing will cause significant problems for the whole area and those who travel through it."
537,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Soldiers have chosen a new regimental goat from a herd living on the Great Orme in Llandudno. The goat joins the 1st Battalion of the Royal Welsh - continuing a tradition dating back 200 years. Lieutenant Colonel Nick Lock said the goat was a full member of the regiment, and needed to be 'calm under pressure' to perform ceremonial duties. The last regimental goat, William 'Billy' Windsor, retired last month after a seven year military career. It starts as a fusilier and if it is well behaved, and does well on parade, quite often he can be promoted to a lance corporal    According to Lt Col Lock the goat is more than a mascot. ""It is a member of the battalion, and in days gone by, when it was a 1,000-men-strong, it was 999 plus the goat,"" he said. As a soldier the goat can also move up the ranks - if it is well behaved. ""It starts as a fusilier and if it is well behaved, and does well on parade, quite often he can be promoted to a lance corporal,"" he said. ""The one that's just retired was a lance corporal,"" he added. All the goats are called William Windsor, or Billy for short. Needing a new goat, and actually getting one, involves some effort however. Goat Major, Lance corporal Ryan Arthur, from Cefn Hengoed near Caerphilly, along with the other soldiers, left the Battalion's base in Chester in the early hours. ""It was pretty hard as we left Chester at 3.00 then got here about 4.30 before going straight out on the ground with our teams rounding up the goats."" A new Billy was found however, although he was second choice - the first kid chosen was a nanny, so she could not join. Months of work now follow to get Billy used to his fellow soldiers, and to learn what is expected of him. ""As he progresses the goat gets used to what he needs to do, and we get him used to sounds and noises because of the marches. ""We also get him used to the boys because obviously the regimental goat is a big thing... it's a pretty exciting period,"" he added. There are perks to the job too because Billy gets a two-a-day cigarette ration, (he eats, them as traditionally they tobacco is thought to be good for the coat) and Guinness to drink when he is older ""to keep the iron up"". The history of the regimental goat dates back to the American War of Independence when a wild goat wandered onto a battlefield. Legend has it the goat ended up leading the regimental colours. In 1884 Queen Victoria presented the regiment, then called the Royal Welch Fusiliers, with a goat from her royal herd, and the tradition has continued.     "
538,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Iran was in breach of international agreements it had signed up to.  The call follows last week's public hanging of two youths convicted of still unclear sexual offences.  Iran insists the youths were convicted of raping a younger boy. However gay rights organisations say the youths were executed for being homosexual.  The case has had considerable global resonance.  Leading European and US gay organisations and publications have already launched letter-writing protest campaigns, and plan to hold demonstrations outside Iranian embassies over the coming weeks.  In a statement issued on Thursday, HRW said Iran was one of only five countries to continue executing juveniles and called for an end to what it called an inhumane punishment.  The Iranian judiciary has reacted angrily to the international outrage surrounding the public hanging of Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni, whom rights activists claim were aged 16 and 18.  Officials said they had been sentenced to whipping and hanging for rape, drinking alcohol and disturbing public order, and deserved the punishment they got.  Rare, close-up pictures of the execution were rapidly published on the internet. In them, officials can be seen placing nooses around the necks of the two obviously distressed, young men.  Public executions are not unusual in Iran but the execution of juveniles often attracts international opprobrium.  The case has been adopted as a cause celebre by gay rights groups.  They say the majority of media reports suggest the official charges were fabricated to reduce any public sympathy for the youths and that the real reason was the youths' sexual orientation.  Homosexuality is illegal in almost all Muslim countries, and punishable by death in many of them.  But gay and human rights groups say Iran's record is particularly shocking, having executed possibly thousands of gay men since the Islamic revolution."
539,"Low levels of radioactivity have been discovered in the cooling waters of a nuclear submarine test reactor at Dounreay, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has said.  Mr Hammond told MPs that no leak had occurred and said there were no safety implications for staff working on the site, or risks to the environment.  But, as a result, HMS Vanguard is to be refuelled with a new nuclear core at a cost of £120m.  The problem was discovered in 2012.  Labour criticised the government for not announcing the information earlier, calling it a matter of ""national importance"".  Although the news is only being made public now, the Ministry of Defence says the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the defence nuclear inspectorate were kept informed.  Mr Hammond said the Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment ran at higher levels of intensity than those on Britain's fleet of nuclear submarines and was designed to pre-empt any similar problems with the reactors on board those vessels.  The defence secretary said: ""These low levels of radioactivity are a normal product of a nuclear reaction that takes place within the fuel but they would not normally enter the cooling water.  ""This water is contained within the sealed reactor circuit and I can reassure the House there has been no detectable radiation leak from that sealed circuit.  ""Indeed, against the International Atomic Energy Agency's measurement scale for nuclear-related events this issue is classed Level 0, described as 'below scale - no safety significance'.""  The refuelling of HMS Vanguard - the UK's oldest nuclear submarine - will take place during its next scheduled ""deep maintenance period"", due to last three and a half years from 2015.  Mr Hammond said: ""This is the responsible option: replacing the core on a precautionary basis at the next opportunity, rather than waiting to see if the core needs to be replaced at a later date which would mean returning Vanguard for a period of unscheduled deep maintenance, potentially putting at risk the resilience of our ballistic missile submarine operations.""  Mr Hammond said a decision on refuelling the next-oldest submarine, HMS Victorious, would not need to be taken until 2018.  New submarines for the Trident replacement programme, known as the Successor submarines, will not be affected by the problem, he added.  For Labour, shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said the government should have told the Commons earlier about the fault.  He added: ""There must be public confidence in the government to be open and transparent on these matters.  ""A fault, however small, that develops in a nuclear reactor is something that the British people and this House should have been told about. This is an issue of national security and national importance."""
540,"The League Managers' Association has apologised after describing offensive text messages sent by Malky Mackay as ""friendly banter"".  The LMA had provoked widespread criticism from anti-discrimination campaigners over its statement.  It said two text messages sent by ex-Cardiff boss Mackay were ""disrespectful of other cultures"" but had defended them as ""friendly text message banter"".  In a fresh statement issued on Friday, the LMA, which represents the interests of football managers, said it ""apologises for some of its wording which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature"".  ""It is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory, even used in private, are totally unacceptable,"" the statement continued.  ""The LMA remains absolutely aware of our responsibility to the game and to promote and uphold the highest standards of behaviour.""  Mackay and former director of recruitment Iain Moody were sacked by Cardiff City last season and the Welsh club sent a dossier to the Football Association alleging misconduct.  Cardiff have called for the resignation of LMA chief executive Richard Bevan.  Several former and current players were also upset that the LMA referred to Mackay's comments as ""banter"", including ex-Brentford and Torquay manager Leroy Rosenior, who threatened to leave the association.  He said: ""If the LMA are going back into the dark ages to support people then I might have to withdraw my support.  ""In over 70,000 text messages I've sent I've never used inappropriate language and I'm sure neither have the vast majority of people.""  Former Reading striker and anti-racism campaigner Jason Roberts wrote on Twitter: ""LMA actually wrote this. They are actually being serious! Somebody drafted that... WOW!""  The original LMA statement said the organisation did ""not condone any potential breach of equal opportunities laws"" but that ""out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees"".  Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp defended Mackay on Friday, describing him as a ""fantastic man"".  ""Malky Mackay has made a big mistake, but he is a fantastic man and a top manager,"" Redknapp said.  ""I am not condoning what he has done but he is not a bad person. Show me someone who has not made a mistake. He has not murdered someone. He has made a mistake but that should not finish his football career.""  Former Professional Footballers' Association chairman Clark Carlisle, who played alongside Mackay for two years at Watford, said: ""You will struggle to find anybody in the industry who has worked with or played against Malky who has a bad word to say about him.  ""But everybody has to separate their opinions as Malky as an individual from the severity of the issue. There is no place for language or sentiment to prejudicial thinking in the game, and if Malky is found to have fallen foul of those standards then he needs to face the consequences.""  Mackay, who lost his job at Cardiff in December, was thought to be favourite for the vacant manager's job at Crystal Palace until the story emerged.  He says he will fully co-operate with any FA investigation and ""looks forward to putting the record straight"".  Moody resigned as Crystal Palace sporting director on Thursday, but has yet to comment on the story.  He was sacked as Cardiff's head of player recruitment last October after a row with owner Vincent Tan over transfer activity and joined Palace a month later."
541,"A major road tunnel could be bored through the Peak District to improve links between Sheffield and Manchester.  A government study will look at the feasibility of tunnelling under the A628 Woodhead Pass, in a scheme which would reportedly cost £6bn.  It is in addition to the Department of Transport's £15bn package to transform major roads across England.  Other improvements for the A628 include adding overtaking lanes to allow faster vehicles to overtake lorries.  Upgrades are also planned for the A57 between Sheffield and Manchester and widening the A1 at Doncaster.  Deputy Prime Minister and Sheffield MP Nick Clegg said the tunnel would have a ""major, transformational effect"" on the area.  ""(We are) looking at the feasibility of this much-discussed but never properly researched option of building a tunnel through the Pennines from Manchester to Sheffield,"" he said.  ""It's not going to be something that happens overnight and at the moment all I'm saying is we're going to commission work into the viability of it.""  The DfT said upgrading routes between Manchester and Sheffield represented the first increase in Trans-Pennine links since 1971.  Further projects set to benefit the region include completing the ""smart motorway"" along the length of the M62 from Leeds to Manchester - using variable speed limits.  But the Campaign for Better Transport described the plans as a ""waste of money"", claiming that building new roads would increase congestion.  Sian Berry, from the group, suggested improving public transport links between Sheffield and Manchester, including re-opening the Woodhead Tunnel railway line, which closed in 1981.  She said: ""There's a disused railway line, the Woodhead Tunnel, and we think that should be reopened as a working, frequent railway.  ""We don't think you should be drilling a big road tunnel through the Peak District. We think traffic should be kept on the roads which should be run more efficiently.""  Of the £15bn spending confirmed by the government on Monday, about £2.3bn will be pumped into 18 schemes across Yorkshire and the north east, aimed at improving bottlenecks and reducing congestion."
542,"Local scientists say it's now so badly damaged that another hurricane would simply sweep it away.  But they don't primarily blame hurricanes for the damage to the coral here on the Belize Barrier Reef; they blame climate change.  And they are backing a petition pressing the United Nations World Heritage Sites Committee to acknowledge that climate change is already damaging world heritage sites.  The five sites are the Belize Barrier reef, at 321km (200 miles) long, the biggest in the western hemisphere; the Australian barrier reef; and glacier parks in Nepal, Peru and the Rockies where glaciers are disappearing as the climate warms.  The World Heritage Sites Treaty stipulates that listed sites should not be damaged by signatories to the treaty, but it was mainly designed to protect the world's treasures in the event of wars.  The stakes are high because if the UN accepts the case, it might lead to poor countries attempting to sue rich countries for damages for the greenhouse gases they've emitted.  Scientists in Belize believe their case is strong. They say the 297km (185 mile) reef here has suffered more than 40% damage since 1998.  They particularly implicate three events of coral bleaching when water temperatures were high.  Corals get their colour from tiny single-cell plants - zooxanthellae - which provide for the reef-building creatures, the polyps.  When temperatures are very high for a protracted period, the zooxanthellae are driven away, the coral loses its colour, the polyps lose their food and so the reef is weakened.  The reefs then easily fall victim to the many forces that assail them - over-fishing, pollution, creatures that eat them, tourist snorkellers who inadvertently smother them with sand, and particularly the storm waves of hurricanes.  Local fishermen say there is no record of bleaching before 1998.  Billy Leslie, who runs the Hustler Dive School in San Pedro in northern Belize, said: ""My father was a commercial fisherman. He tells me that we have never heard of coral bleaching like this. It's a horrible sight to see; the coral just gets whiter and whiter every day.""  Richard Foster, a wildlife cameraman, said: ""I first started diving here in the early 80s and you just won't believe the difference with today. The corals were so thick they were competing with each other on the bottom. There was no space between the corals.  Dr Melanie McField, from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, US, has been studying the reefs for more than a decade.  She is confident that climate change is a key factor: ""On an annual basis, the sea temperatures in the Caribbean haven't changed much, but we are now registering prolonged periods of severe heating that we didn't see before.  ""When the water temperature is elevated we get a bleaching alert - and this coincides pretty accurately with the bleaching events.  ""The other big sign that the water temperatures are to blame rather than local pollution is that the bleaching episodes happen all over the Caribbean at the same time.""  Dr McField is angry that Belize has been working hard to protect its reefs but is suffering from a problem beyond its control.  She is also concerned about another major fear for the future of the corals - ocean acidification.  The Royal Society, the UK's academy of science, argued last year that so much CO2 from fossil-fuel burning was being absorbed into the oceans that surface waters were becoming acidified.  Research in Plymouth and Jerusalem shows that many species of corals are easily damaged by even a slight lowering of pH.  A small minority of coral researchers believe that fears over climate change and acidification have been exaggerated.  They argue that over time the reefs will adapt to warmer waters and that calcium littering the ocean floors will buffer the effects of acidification.  Dr McField accepts that reefs might eventually adapt but says this could take thousands of years.  In the meantime countries making money from reefs would suffer huge economic damage, she says.  Miguel Alamilla, who runs a marine protected area off the town of San Pedro, has a message for the big nations emitting greenhouse gases.  ""They need to open up and don't be egoistic but think globally,"" he said. ""Be aware that people are dependent on the coral reef and their livelihoods depend on that.  ""If it is destroyed what will happen to them?""  The UN campaigners believe these are powerful arguments in their favour.  They will face, though, determined resistance on the World Heritage Committee from the US. Objections to the petition include:"
543,"Liverpool eased into the second phase of the Champions League with a comfortable victory over disappointing opponents at Anfield.  Dortmund were restricted to only a handful of chances as Liverpool turned in a superbly disciplined performance.  Vladimir Smicer opened the scoring for the home side early in the first half and defender Stephen Wright made sure of victory late on.  Dortmund, who could have qualified for the second phase with a draw, were desperately poor. But this was due in large part to Liverpool's authoritative performance. Their reshuffled defence, with Jamie Carragher alongside Stephane Henchoz in the middle and Wright at right-back, dealt comfortably with the few attacks that Dortmund mustered. Steven Gerrard and Dietmar Hamann were authoritative in midfield and Smicer provided some bright touches. It was the Czech playmaker who gave Liverpool their breakthrough after 15 minutes. Henchoz pumped forward a long ball to Heskey in the area. The England striker headed back to the edge of the area to Smicer, who struck a sweet left-footed volley past Lehmann into the far corner. Dortmund seemed frightened of the pace of Michael Owen and defended very deep. They carved out a rare chance when Evanilson's shot from the right corner of the area was cleared to Sorenson, who struck a low shot marginally wide of the far post.  Liverpool were content to sit on their lead, but Lehamnn had to be alert to block an inswinging John Arne Riise free-kick near the interval. The visitors failed to make much more of an impression after the break, despite needing to win to have a chance of progressing to the second phase. Liverpool rarely needed to extend themselves. They went close when lungeing Owen was inches away from connecting with an excellent Gerrard cross. And near the end Wright sealed victory when, unmarked, he headed a Patrik Berger free-kick home from inside the six yard box. Dortmund forward Lars Ricken beat Liverpool keeper Jerzy Dudek with a curling shot near the end, but the ball rebounded back off the crossbar. In truth, Dortmund did not deserve any more."
544,"For many people, there's nothing new about laughing at Lembit Opik.  This is, after all, the MP who wanted public funds to hunt planet-destroying asteroids. The man whose, shall we say, complicated personal life got him many more headlines than his Commons speeches ever did. The only difference this time was that he actually wanted us to laugh.  Was it really so surprising that the former MP for Montgomeryshire might see a future career in comedy? He seemed to take a cab straight from his election night declaration to the Have I Got News For You studio.  The venue for his stand-up debut was the Backstage Comedy Club, a modest-sized L-shaped venue near the theatres and cinemas of London's West End.  The organisers suddenly found themselves setting up photocalls, while politely declining requests from TV crews - The One Show were already in, any more cameramen, and there would be little room for paying punters.  The size of the audience was not lost on comedy's newest star: ""I'm launching my new career six feet under, in the comedy equivalent of an overcrowded coffin.""  In many ways, it's not that different from a maiden speech in the Commons. A nervous newcomer takes the stage in front of a crowd teetering on outright hostility.  Among that crowd, a handful of Lembit's former political colleagues, including Labour MP Stephen Pound, who proved to be the most vocal of the night's hecklers.  The audience had been nicely warmed for his debut, with a couple of very good acts. And when Lembit took to the stage (I say stage, I mean slightly raised platform) he certainly looked nervous.  Actually, he looked like he was canvassing, in a suit and tie, complete with Lib Dem rosette.  An early gag, about Nick Clegg ignoring him in a lift, belied the rather bitter truth about his new status.  ""I'm earning a hundred quid for this,"" he told the 70-strong crowd, though claimed the associated costs meant it was actually costing him £37 to perform.  There were many people to thank - the comedy promoters, his political team, and of course the voters of Montgomeryshire, without whose waning enthusiasm he wouldn't be contemplating a career change.  And it's clear that, in many ways, Lembit's heart is still in Westminster, less than a mile from the comedy basement in which he stood.  His name, he reminded us, is almost an anagram of ""I like to be MP"". His promoter had said it would be a good night if he wasn't bottled off the stage. A modest aspiration.  Did he manage it? He didn't hang around to find out. Within five seconds of saying his goodbyes he was out of the door. The woman next to me described his set as ""not fantastic, but not completely awful"".  His brief ventriloquism with a shoe, cunningly titled ""Mr Shoe"", wasn't really comedy gold. But then much truly golden comedy is rooted in misfortune. Lembit should do alright then."
545,"As the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at Dartford approaches, one man remembers what it was like to help build the famous structure.  Millions of people in south-east England have crossed the Dartford bridge. It is as well known for the length of its tailbacks as it is for the height of its imposing structure.  However, when Dennis McNally sees the bridge, he says he feels suitably ""chuffed"" as he was one of the people who helped to build the concrete pier towers central to the structure.  Originally from Newcastle, Mr McNally moved to Dartford to work on a ferry terminal project, before becoming the general foreman in charge of concreting and labour for the new bridge.  It was his job to supervise the construction of the four main piers on each side of the river. Reaching about 200ft (61m), the towers were slip formed - a procedure used for constructing large chimneys.  ""Once you start pouring the concrete, you carry on until it [the tower] is finished at the top,"" explained Mr McNally.  ""It's 24 hours a day pouring concrete - it creeps up an inch at a time and it took 10 days and 10 nights per column.""  On a clear day he could see most of Essex and Kent from the top of the towers.  He said: ""When you look at the area now it's all industrialised. When we were there it was all fields - that's all you could see.""  During one of Mr McNally's shifts up a tower on the Essex side, a World War II bomb was found on the approach road to the bridge.  ""When I looked over the side I could see the traffic for miles in both directions on the M25 and nothing was moving, the tunnel was shut and I hadn't a clue how I was going to get home when my shift finished.  ""Fortunately the fella who took over from me lived on the Essex side so he came up and I came down.  ""I had no way of getting across so I got a safety boat - it took us across and I walked up to the pub to wait until the traffic moved.""  Even as it was being built the bridge was subject of discussion and controversy.  ""When I was on the Essex side people used to complain it was called the Dartford bridge - they didn't like the idea and wanted to call it the Tilbury Bridge.  ""I said 'You can call it what you like it will be always be called the Dartford bridge' - and it is, even though it's named the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge.""  Mr McNally worked on the project for about two years.  When the towers were almost ready, because there was no scaffold, a team of specialist abseilers were brought in to go down over the sides on ropes and patch up and make good any little holes.  Mr McNally believes the new bridge was necessary at the time but now, after just 20 years, the problems at the crossing are back to what they were prior to the bridge opening.  He said: ""They built the bridge because the tunnel couldn't cope and everything was perfect for a while but now there is just too much traffic again and they need another one - preferably not in Dartford.""  However, 20 years on Mr McNally still remains proud of his involvement with the bridge.  ""When I see it I think 'I helped to build that' and so does everybody else in the family. In fact it's known as Den's bridge."""
546,"Out of the wreckage of the old Yugoslavia a new union is currently being formed between Serbia and Montenegro. This act of creation is a sign that a great experiment in the 'land of the south Slavs' (which is what Yugoslavia means) is finally over. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. This decision in Belgrade's federal parliament to create a new loose union between the two republics, called simply Serbia and Montenegro, and to finally consign the name of Yugoslavia to history, shows how the legislators have bowed to reality. The real Yugoslavia perished in the 1990s, during the wars that consumed it. The great experiment in this Slavic nation was based on a noble idea. Its proponents thought that south Slavs, that is to say people with much in common, especially their languages, who lived in a great arc of territory from the borders of Austria almost to the gates of Constantinople (now Istanbul), should unite and form one great strong south Slav state. Ideas for a union of the southern Slavs had begun circulating at least as early as the 1840s. In the regions that were to become part of modern Croatia, thinkers dreamed of a new Illyria - a name harking back to the days of the Roman Empire. Amongst Serbs, however, such notions were less prevalent. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. Dreams of a union, state or empire came easily to the lands of the south Slavs because all of the people who lived in what was to become Yugoslavia were then the subjects of others. And the fault-lines of empire divided the south Slavs from one another. By 1912, however, the first of the wars that were to convulse this region periodically throughout the 20th century was about to begin. Two small Serbian and Montenegrin states had already emerged and become independent - having shaken off the Ottoman Turkish yoke - but the rest of what was to become Yugoslavia was still part of either the Ottoman or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Serbian nationalist thinkers dreamed of recreating, first a Serbian state and then perhaps a Serbian empire. With the first Balkan war of 1912 all that began to change. The new small states of Serbia and Montenegro, fighting alongside Greece and Bulgaria, managed to push the Turks back to Constantinople. Serbia and Montenegro conquered Kosovo, and Serbia took a large share of Macedonia. For many Serbs and other Slavs living within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Serbia was their champion. Inspired, and also helped, by Serbia's secret services, one of these young radicals took a pot-shot at the heir to throne of Austro-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand, who was visiting Bosnia on 28 June 1914.  Within months the old order was gone. The assassination in Sarajevo sparked off World War One, which in its wake destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Empire. What was to replace it? Many Croat, Serb and other south Slav soldiers remained loyal to Austria-Hungary during the war, but there were also some who did not. Indeed, some of its politicians feared that as Austria-Hungary crumbled Italy would seize as much of the coast of Dalmatia as it could, while Serbia would create a new greatly enlarged Serbian state, including Bosnia and parts of what are now Croatia - especially those areas that were then heavily inhabited by Serbs. The politicians felt that a deal must be reached with Serbia. A new union was to be proclaimed. The Serbian Army would save Croatia and Slovenia from the territorial ambitions of the Italians, and union would also save Croatia from Serbia itself. The kingdom was formed on 1 December 1918. Serbia's royal family, the Karadjordjevics, became that of the new country, which was officially called the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929 - when it became Yugoslavia. The country was carved up. Immediately it became clear that the union was not a happy one. Many Croats especially resented it, because they felt they had exchanged the domination of Vienna for that of Serbian Belgrade. Kosovo's Albanian population was restive too. Albanians were not Slavs and were bitter that Kosovo had not been able to join the newly independent Albania (which proclaimed its independence in 1912). Macedonian nationalists also resented the new state. So Yugoslavia lurched from crisis to crisis until finally it collapsed, with barely a fight, in 1941 - when attacked by Nazi Germany and Mussolini's fascist Italy. The country was carved up. A tiny extreme fascist quisling clique, known as the Ustashas, was installed in power in the Croatian capital Zagreb. They began a campaign of terror and genocide directed especially at the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia. Resistance soon began to emerge. In Serbia so-called Chetnik forces loyal to the old Serbian-dominated Yugoslav order began to fight, and so did a communist dominated resistance under the half-Slovene half-Croat Josip Broz - also known as Tito.  The war years were a nightmare of inter-ethnic bloodletting, fighting and wars within wars. While Yugoslavia was occupied and resistance was directed against the occupiers, in fact the majority of those who died, did so in fighting between nationalists of various stripes - royalists, communists, quislings and so on. Tito's forces, however, soon gained the recognition and help of the Allies. They also offered an ideal - a dream of 'brotherhood and unity' - that would link the nations or peoples of Yugoslavia. By 1945 Tito's forces were victorious, and crucially, although the Soviet Red Army had helped in the struggle, it had now moved on to central Europe. So Tito, not Moscow, would shape the new state. But Tito was a communist, loyal to Stalin. He wanted to model his country on the Soviet Union, so a federal state of six republics was proclaimed (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia). Stalin was wary of Tito, however, and in 1948 the two fell out. Yugoslavia was expelled from the communist bloc but Tito did not fall from power, as many had expected. He survived, and began to chart an independent course for the nation he ruled. Over the next 40 years Yugoslavia changed beyond recognition. It developed its own brand of socialism, and a society far more open than that of its communist neighbours. For them, and for many communists around the world, Yugoslavia seemed to be a paradise on earth. At home the federation appeared to have solved the bitter national questions of the past, living standards were high and, unlike in other communist countries, citizens were free to travel to the west, either to work or to take holidays. Tito's Yugoslavia also gained enormous prestige as a founder of the non-aligned movement, which aimed to find a place in world politics for countries that did not want to stand foursquare behind either of the two superpowers. Even liberal communism had its limits... Despite all this, and although there was much substance to Tito's Yugoslavia, much was illusion too. The economy was built on the shaky foundations of massive western loans. Even liberal communism had its limits, as did the very nature of the federation. Stirrings of nationalist dissent in Croatia and Kosovo were crushed. The federation worked because in reality the voice of only one man counted - that of Tito himself.  When Tito died in 1980, Yugoslavs were shocked and apprehensive. They had been prepared for his demise with the slogan 'After Tito - Tito'. But there was no new Tito. Without him the state began to unravel, as the governments of the republics began to exercise the powers that were due to them under the constitution. Dissent began to grow. Serbs complained of persecution at the hands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Croats and Slovenes resented the fact that money earned from tourists in their republics went to subsidise poorer parts of Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo. Albanians there demonstrated for their own republic, and even for secession and union with Albania. ...by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. Managing these strains and crises was hard enough, but by the late 1980s some people began to sense that communism itself was in question. And if it was, what was to replace it? For Slobodan Milosevic, an up-and-coming politician in Serbia, the answer was nationalism. Seizing on the delicate issue of Kosovo, Milosevic came to supreme power. And so, Yugoslavia began to crumble. In 1989 Milosevic abolished Kosovo's autonomy. Croats and Slovenes feared that they were next in line. In this way a spiral of competitive and mutually fearful nationalisms began to destroy the country. Politicians fanned the embers of all the old divisions - Serbs versus Croats, Orthodox Christians versus Catholics versus Muslims, and so on. Milosevic clearly wanted to dominate all of the old Yugoslavia, but when he realised that he could not, he switched to another option, that of a Greater Serbia. History had scattered the Serbs especially, well outside the borders of Serbia. Milosevic argued that the federation meant that nations could secede from it, but not republics. So, he said, Slovenia - with no indigenous minorities - and Croatia could leave Yugoslavia if they wished - but then Croatia could not take its Serb areas with it. The stage was set for war. The stage was set for war. The story of those conflicts in Slovenia, in Croatia, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and finally NATO's war in Yugoslavia, has been told many times.  Now, prosperous Slovenia is looking forward to EU and NATO membership. Croatia is recovering from war, and its territory is intact, although most of its Serbs have fled or been driven out. Bosnia is divided into two, a shattered land still struggling to overcome the legacy of the war. Macedonia has been riven by ethnic conflict - but spared all-out war - between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians returned to Kosovo after the war there, but then 230,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians were forced to flee. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. Serbia and Montenegro have been impoverished by the wars and even today - as their new union is being formed - their future state is far from assured. Serbs and Montenegrins have much in common, especially their common Orthodox heritage, but Serbia is a land of some eight million people, and Montenegro has only 650,000 citizens. Whether two republics of such unequal size can work together in one federation remains to be seen. The new deal is for a loose union for three years, after which either republic can opt for independence. On paper it is a sensible compromise. In reality it will be hard, but not impossible, to make it work - if there is enough goodwill. The new deal, however, makes no provision for Kosovo, a UN protectorate since 1999, but still nominally part of Yugoslavia - or now its successor state. Its majority Albanian population has no intention of ever entering any new union with Belgrade, while its Serbs have no intention of permitting it to take the path of independence. If they can't prevent independence they (and the policymakers in Belgrade), would probably like to partition it, with the northern Serbian inhabited areas staying within Serbia. So, the final disintegration of the old Yugoslav state is not yet complete. Having taken their different paths, the people of the former Yugoslavia will look back on the past with different and mixed emotions. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country, and in Serbia and Montenegro most people are simply too exhausted by the conflicts of the past and the difficulties of life to really care. The final end of Yugoslavia will barely be noticed in much of the old country... But throughout the old Yugoslavia, and especially amongst those who grew up under Tito (except perhaps the Kosovo Albanians), the passing of its name will leave many with a wistful feeling - a feeling for which, indeed, they already have a name: Yugonostalgia."
547,"The group beat Travis and Idlewild into second and third place respectively.  Franz Ferdinand, who recently picked up five Brit Award nominations, ended up in 15th place, while the Eurythmics wound up at a lowly 38.  Other Scottish acts, such as the Mull Historical Society who also featured in the top 50, performed at a party in Glasgow where the result was announced.  Scottish-based band Snow Patrol, who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of Brit Awards, were among the performers who covered well-known Scottish pop songs at the party on Wednesday night.  They were the surprise winners of the Brit Award for best breakthrough act two years later.  Scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list, including 1970s tartan boy band the Bay City Rollers and goth favourites the Jesus and Mary Chain.  Scottish magazine The List recently compiled a list of the top 50 Scottish bands of all time, but left the final decision to the public.  The magazine's music editor Mark Robertson said: ""The idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of Scottish music, from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop, right up to today's international stars.""  ""Everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide,"" he added.  BBC Radio Scotland presenter Vic Galloway, who has been involved in the project, said it had been ""great fun"" to look back at Scotland's musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming Scottish acts."
548,"A retired general who defended the use of torture by French forces during Algeria's war of independence has died.  Paul Aussaresses, 95, was the first senior French officer who admitted torturing and killing Algerian prisoners-of-war, in a book he published in 2001 about the conflict.  In 2002 a French court convicted him of defending the use of torture.  He was stripped of his Legion of Honour, one of France's top merit awards, after the book appeared.  Aussaresses never regretted the use of torture. He said ""it became legitimate when the situation demanded it"".  He also maintained that the government of the day was not only aware of the atrocities, but also approved them.  A member of the National Liberation Front (FLN) who fought in the war, Louisette Ighilahriz, said Aussaresses should have expressed remorse.  ""He was honest. He admitted torturing Algerians... But he didn't go all the way. He should have expressed regret,"" she told the AFP news agency.  Born in November 1918 at Saint Paul Cap de Joux in the south of France, Aussaresses enlisted in the French secret services and went on to found the counter-espionage unit.  In 1957 he was approached to establish order in Algeria. He himself described the unit he was heading as a ""death squad"" that was charged with carrying out night raids, torture and the removal of certain detainees.  After the Algerian war he went to lecture the US special forces at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in the ""techniques of the Battle of Algiers"" including the use of torture. Analysts say many of those techniques were used during the Vietnam War.  In 1973, he was sent to Brazil during the military dictatorship as French military attache.  In a statement to the French broadcaster, France 24, the French rights group, Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT) said that ""during his career Aussaresses not only practiced torture, but also taught the techniques of torture in clandestine programmes with Latin American dictatorships in the 1970s"".  The Algerian war of independence of 1954-1962 was a brutal conflict in which both sides are known to have committed atrocities.  But the use of torture came as a shocking revelation to the French.  President Jacques Chirac, who also served in Algeria, was said to have been horrified by Aussaresses's actions.  He called for disciplinary action against the retired general and stripped him of his medal and his military rank.  Under the terms of a post-war amnesty, Aussaresses could not be tried for war crimes, and human rights groups campaigned for prosecution on a charge of being an apologist for war crimes.  Asked if he ever regretted his actions, he said he did not suffer sleepless nights.  ""Am I a criminal? An assassin? A monster? No. I'm but a soldier who did his job and who did it for France because the country demanded it,"" he said."

550,"Ryanair is pulling out of Belfast City Airport from 31 October, the airline has announced.  Passengers are advised to check with Ryanair for bookings made after the date.  The airline said the decision followed the airport's confirmation that a public inquiry into a planned runway extension would be further delayed.  Ryanair has been operating from George Best Belfast City Airport since 2007.  The airline currently flies from the City Airport to five locations in the UK - Bristol, the East Midlands, Prestwick, Liverpool and London.  The airline flies about 800,000 passengers a year from the airport.  Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that ""it is very disappointing that the promised runway extension at Belfast City Airport has still not materialised more than three years after we opened the base at Belfast City"".  Mr O'Leary added that ""in these circumstances, sadly, we have better alternative airports elsewhere in the UK and Europe, all of whom are willing and able to provide us with the runway infrastructure and low-cost facilities we need"".  He also said if permission was granted in the future, then Ryanair would come back.  The company said that from November, Ryanair will switch its one Belfast City-based aircraft to another European airport, with the loss of 50 Ryanair jobs.  It said that all staff will be offered relocation elsewhere in the UK or Europe.  On Tuesday, Katy Best, business development director at George Best Belfast City Airport, said that ""we are obviously disappointed at Ryanair's decision; the airline had provided five successful routes from Belfast City Airport"".  ""However, passenger figures had proved that there was significant demand for the routes operated by Ryanair and I am confident that we can attract other airlines to fill the void,"" she said.  Northern Ireland Planning Minister Edwin Poots, who referred the runway extension to a public inquiry, said he was disappointed.  He added the airline could have operated international flights from Belfast International Airport.  ""There has been an economic downturn and as a consequence airline companies are cutting their cloth,"" he said.  ""Northern Ireland unfortunately has failed to meet requirements for Ryanair.""  Liz Fawcett, spokeswoman for Belfast City Airport Watch, which opposes the runway extension, said: ""Residents are very pleased.  ""They had a particularly unpopular 6.30am flight and certainly this will give some respite.""  Its operations from Derry City airport are not affected by Tuesday's decision.  Belfast City Airport has wanted to build a runway extension for some time.  BBC NI business correspondent Kevin Magee said this would have allowed Ryanair to fly to destinations much further afield.  ""But the extension proposal is now tied up into the planning process.  ""Earlier this month, the Planning Appeals Commission delayed a planned public inquiry into the proposed extension until further information is provided by the airport.  ""The objections to the extension centre on environmental, social and economic concerns,"" said our correspondent."
551,"The American regained the title she won in 2000 and 2001 with a 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 9-7 victory over the world number one.  Davenport served for the match at 6-5 in the second but was broken, and had a match point in the third.  But Williams kept fighting and, as Davenport struggled with a back strain, broke in game 15 to win in 2hrs 45min.  Williams went into the match on the back of a stunning win over defending champion Maria Sharapova in the semi-finals but could not repeat that form early on.  Davenport was soon 5-2 ahead and held her nerve to serve out despite losing one of the breaks.  In a nervous second set, Davenport angrily questioned a call in game nine and faced a set point in the following game, but held on with a big serve.  At 5-5 the pressure became too much for Williams, who opened with two double-faults before netting a forehand and slipping over on break point.  But it was not over, as Williams stunned Davenport by breaking back to love and then surging through the tie-break.  Davenport made the first breakthrough in the decider with a break in game six and went on to lead 4-2, 40-15, before Williams came roaring back.  The top seed then left Centre Court for treatment on a lower back injury and on her return soon got to match point on the Williams serve.  Still the drama continued as Williams dug deep to find a backhand winner, and five games later it was the 14th seed who broke with a rasping forehand winner.  This time there were no more twists and, after double-faulting on her first match point, Williams clinched the title when Davenport netted a forehand.  An ecstatic champion could hardly contain herself, leaping into the air in delight at the moment of victory.  ""There were so many times she was trying to stay in the match and I couldn't have asked for a better opponent.""  Williams added: ""I have to say thanks to Serena. She was so encouraging to me.  ""You never know what life is going to throw at you, so every day I just expect the sun to come up, that's all.""  Davenport agreed that she had experience a memorable final on Centre Court, even though she settled for the runner-ups honours.  ""Even after I lost the second set, I thought, 'this is a great match,'"" said Davenport.  ""Obviously I'm extremely disappointed but it was exhilarating and I felt like I played great and got really close."""
552,"Shares in the UK defence contractor BAE Systems and the European aerospace firm EADS have both fallen a day after they revealed they had entered merger talks.  Shares in BAE, which rose 7% on Wednesday before rumours of discussions were confirmed, closed down 7.3% on Thursday.  EADS shares dropped 10.2% - adding to the drop of 5% on Wednesday.  With governments holding stakes in the two companies, politicians were weighing the merits of the move.  Germany and France hold stakes in EADS, and the UK has a special ""golden share"" - a holding that blocks unwanted takeovers - in BAE.  The three governments would receive special shares in the new company also designed to stop hostile takeovers.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the possible merger was being investigated and the UK government is looking at whether the plan is in the public interest.  EADS has aerospace and defence operations in France, Germany and Spain, and owns the planemaker Airbus, which makes aircraft wings in the UK.  Its major shareholders include the French media-to-aerospace group Lagardere, which together with the French state holds 22%, Germany's Daimler, which owns 22%, but has pledged to sell a third of this to the German government, and the Spanish government which owns a further 5.5%.  The head of EADS's Airbus unit, Fabrice Bregier, told employees in a letter that the move would provide them with a stronger employer: ""Such a combination would strengthen EADS and BAE Systems - thereby making Airbus part of a stronger company overall.""  Lagardere said it was scrutinising the terms and conditions of the deal, while Daimler said it might provide it with the chance to sell its stake on the open market.  The US Pentagon said it would examine the implications of such a move if it was asked to.  US aerospace and defence giant Boeing is a major competitor and has had a number of long-running battles with Airbus, including over whether the support the two receive amount to illegal government subsidies.  A merged BAE and EADS would overtake Boeing in terms of sales, which, based on last year's data would be in the region of $93bn (£58bn; 72bn euros), compared with Boeing's $68.7bn and its fellow US group Lockheed Martin's $46.5bn.  Boeing has said the tie-up could increase the Europeans' presence in the US because of BAE's work in the country, but says it does not see a merger as something that would threaten it ""fundamentally"".  BAE and EADS have said that a merger ""offers the prospect of significant benefits for customers and shareholders of both companies"".  Under the code of the UK's Takeover Panel, the two parties must now announce a decision on the outcome of their talks by 17:00 BST on 10 October.  BAE usually pays shareholders a higher proportion of its earnings as a dividend than EADS.  As a result, if the merger were to go ahead, EADS would pay £200m to its shareholders before completion.  The Unite union, which represents BAE workers, said it was vital the government ensured the move would not involve job cuts.  Cuts to defence budgets in certain countries, including the US and the UK, are making life harder for defence firms.  BAE reported a 14% fall in sales last year while profits fell by 7%.  In May, BAE announced it would cut more than 600 jobs and close its Newcastle factory."
553,"Kevin Pietersen's England career is over after he was told he is no longer part of the national team's plans.  The 33-year-old batsman, England's all-time leading run-scorer across all formats, was given the news by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).  ECB managing director Paul Downton said: ""The time is right to rebuild not only the team but also the team ethic.""  Pietersen responded: ""I will continue to play but deeply regret that it won't be for England.""  He scored 8,181 runs at an average of 47 in 104 Tests, in addition to 4,440 runs in 136 one-day internationals and 1,176 runs in 37 Twenty20s.  ""Playing cricket for my country has been an honour,"" said South Africa-born Pietersen, who made his England debut in 2004.  ""Every time I pulled on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and that is something that will live with me forever.  ""Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years. I believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer.""  England were whitewashed 5-0 by Australia in the Ashes Test series and Pietersen, his team's leading run-scorer, was criticised for the manner of some of his dismissals.  He said last month he was ""determined to help regain the Ashes"" in England in 2015 and was included in a provisional 30-man squad for the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, starting in March, when limited-overs coach Ashley Giles described him as a ""million-pound asset"".  But the ECB have now decided he no longer has a future with England and are due to name their squad for the World Twenty20, plus a limited-overs tour of the West Indies that begins later this month, this week.  The ECB said that the England management, which includes Giles, Downton and national selector James Whitaker, agreed ""unanimously"" that Pietersen would not be part of their plans for those trips or beyond.  Downton, who took over from Hugh Morris on 1 February, added: ""Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England, as the fact that he is the country's leading run-scorer in international cricket demonstrates.  ""However, everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long-term planning after the Australia tour. Therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future.""  The ECB's decision, announced via a statement, brings to an end Pietersen's brilliant but controversial career.  He is regarded by many as England's best player - his tally of 23 Test centuries is second only to Test captain Alastair Cook in the all-time list - and only six players have played more Tests for England.  In his debut Test series in 2005, he helped England win the Ashes for the first time in 18 years, one of four Ashes triumphs in his career.  Appointed captain in 2008, he resigned after only five months following what the ECB described as an ""irretrievable breakdown"" in his relationship with then coach Peter Moores, who was sacked.  Pietersen was named player of the tournament as England won the World Twenty20 in 2010, their first major limited-overs trophy.  He retired from international limited-overs cricket in May 2012 before reversing his decision two months later.  The Surrey batsman was dropped during the Test series against South Africa that summer for sending ""provocative"" text messages to opposing players, for which he apologised to then captain Andrew Strauss.  Pietersen was overlooked for England's World Twenty20 defence later that year and was added to the touring party for the winter trip to India only after a successful ""integration period"".  The Ashes hammering down under was followed by reports of divisions in the England dressing room, but former spinner Graeme Swann, who retired midway through the series, claimed Pietersen's behaviour had been ""much improved"" since his reintegration.  Shortly before he quit as team director last week, Andy Flower denied issuing the ECB with an ultimatum to choose between him or Pietersen.  Downton said: ""England cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Kevin, who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill.  ""This decision brings some clarity now for the future of the England teams and we all wish Kevin the very best in the rest of his career."""
554,"Is Rory McGrath a deceiver? He exudes a cuddly laid-back persona complete with an almost constant winning smile.  But, in the words of one viewer, whose letter led the BBC to rebuke the comic, McGrath can be ""gross and poisonous"".  McGrath's unprintable joke about the sex-life of the Beckhams is part of a seemingly endless campaign he has waged against these icons of British culture.  In the words of the BBC, he ""went even beyond the broad limits which the programme has established for itself"".  Those limits have recently extended to Jonathan Ross exhibiting his private parts - mercifully to his team mates, rather than the viewing public.  Victoria Beckham has not been amused by the jokes and recently described McGrath as ""that ugly b******, and you can print that"". Unfortunately, Posh, we can't.  If Manchester United fans are angered by McGrath's anti-Beckham jibes, they should not worry. As a dedicated Arsenal fan, McGrath has perhaps killed any ideas Victoria may have harboured about tempting her hubbie to Highbury.  McGrath fits perfectly into the current vogue for laddishness in the British media. ""I take it as a compliment when I am accused of being a bit chauvinistic on the show,"" he once said.  The insults he delivers, particularly to his stooge, Gary Lineker, are mostly scripted, says former show regular Lee Hurst. McGrath believes they are one of the main reasons the show is still attracting nine million viewers in its tenth series.  He is probably right. Insults are the name of the game. Ask Anne Robinson.  The very fact that he is on a TV show at all, is the fulfilment of an ambition that Rory McGrath has held since his early years growing up in a council house in Redruth, Cornwall.  He began writing comedy scripts at 14. He was a clever boy with that enviable quality of being able to do well in exams without putting in much effort.  At Cambridge he studied modern languages and joined the Footlights drama group ""just so I could get on the telly"". The plan worked.  He met other members of the so-called Cambridge mafia who have gone on to achieve so much success in British comedy.  Among them were Griff Rhys-Jones and Mel Smith - founders of the Talkback production company that now produces They Think... - and Jimmy Mulville, whom he met on his first day. The pair went on to establish their own television production company, Hat Trick.  McGrath still retains some bitterness at being sacked by his great friend in 1992, for allegedly not pulling his weight. The confrontation came days after McGrath had left his wife and two young children.  He and Mulville have not spoken since. It may be some consolation that They Think... is pulling in more viewers than Hat Trick's flagship quiz show, Have I Got News for You.  After university, McGrath and Mulville moved to London where Rhys-Jones helped them get work writing BBC radio scripts for Frankie Howerd and Windsor Davies.  Later they progressed to Not the Nine O'clock News and Alas Smith and Jones. Later still, they wrote the near-the-knuckle Channel 4 satirical show Who Dares Wins, followed by the successful sit-com Chelmsford 123, which was set in Roman Britain.  He has continued in a historical vein in the History Fix and History Quest series for BBC Knowledge. He also appears sporadically in holiday and cookery programmes.  Rory McGrath now lives in Cambridge with his partner, Nicola.  The pair first met at university and McGrath once described the devastation he felt on leaning she had married someone else.  When he was doing a stint on the Channel 4 programme Right to Reply in 1995, Nicola wrote him a letter asking if he still remembered her and telling him that her own marriage had ended.  He was overjoyed, they agreed to meet and have now lived together happily for five years. Such romance in one so laddish!"
555,"Council chiefs hope Mick and Keith could return to the resort More than four decades after their gig at the Empress Ballroom finished in a riot, The Rolling Stones are finally being allowed back into Blackpool. The former hell raisers were given an indefinite ban from the resort in 1964 after fans stormed the stage. More than 50 people were taken to hospital after fans ripped up seats, threw bottles and smashed a piano. But now council chiefs are writing to the Stones saying it is all over now - and have invited them back. The band were bundled off stage as the ballroom erupted in violence, believed to have started after a member of the 7,000-strong crowd spat at guitarist Brian Jones. Historian Terry Regan, who was in the audience, said: ""Although I was a young bloke at the time I was quite scared. Fans were determined to touch the band, a witness says ""There was a mass rush for the stage. ""There was a group of people, probably two or three hundred, determined to lay hands on the Rolling Stones."" The Stones tried to return to the resort a year after the incident to play at a different venue. But the police watch committee refused them a licence, saying there would be too much trouble - a ban which has effectively kept the band out of the resort ever since. However, it's a situation that current council leader Peter Callow would like to see remedied to bring some glamour back to the resort. ""I've given instruction to our council officers to write to The Rolling Stones to say: 'Right, the ban is lifted. We reach out the hand of friendship.' ""What I am saying is: 'Come back Mick, all is forgiven.'"" The Rolling Stones have not commented on the lifting of the ban.     "
556,"The drummer of Scottish rock band Travis has suffered a suspected spinal injury in a swimming pool accident.  Other members of the band rushed to pull Neil Primrose out of the water after the accident in France.  He was taken to a local hospital in Belfort and the band's management said ""early indications"" were that he had broken a vertebra.  The management said Primrose struck his head and was rendered unconscious in the accident.  Fellow band and crew members, who had also been relaxing by the pool after a week of European festival appearances, went to his aid and he was taken away by ambulance to hospital where he has been undergoing tests.  The group's management issued a statement which said: ""Whilst relaxing in the pool, Travis drummer Neil Primrose struck his head and was knocked unconscious.  ""After realising his predicament, other band and crew members dragged Neil from the pool and gave him assistance.  ""He was taken by ambulance to the local hospital in Belfort to receive treatment and to undergo tests.  ""Early indications suggest that Neil has sustained a fracture on one of his vertebrae and is still in hospital in France undergoing further tests.""  Speaking to the Scottish Sun from hospital, Primrose said things cold have been ""a lot worse"" if he had struck his head a different way.  ""We went back to the hotel for a couple of beers and I dived into the pool. It was too shallow and I bumped my head and knocked myself out,"" he told the newspaper.  ""The guys had been watching me but then realised it looked a bit more serious.  ""I was floating beneath the surface of the water. They pretty much jumped in and got me out.""  The band's management said the accident has forced Travis to cancel its forthcoming concerts.  ""We wish to apologise to all our fans for any inconvenience caused but hope you will join us in wishing Neil a full and speedy recovery,"" said the statement.  Full refunds would be offered for all of the cancelled concerts, apart from Carhaix which is a three-day festival.  The management stressed that David Bowie would still be appearing at Lucca."
557,"As people live longer and medical technology improves, more and more of us will have a surgical implant before we die. We are also getting cremated in larger numbers - and so there is often some expensive metal left among the ashes. Where does it go?  ""You tell people what you do, and they think... well, that's a bit strange,"" says Ruud Verberne above the din of giant sorting machines twirling and clanking.  Verberne is co-founder of OrthoMetals, which recycles metal implants from cremated human bodies. That's everything from steel pins to titanium hips and cobalt-chrome knees.  These are the knees that we have to recover,"" he says. ""Some metals can be sorted by magnets. And the remaining have to be sorted by hand.""  Strange it may be, and a bit macabre perhaps, but this kind of recycling is a growth industry.  ""I know the existence of five or six competitors that we have, most of them in the United States,"" says Verberne, whose company is based in the Dutch city of Zwolle. ""But we were first.""  Verberne had a long career in aluminium recycling. Then, in 1987, he met Jan Gabriels, an orthopaedic surgeon, who asked him what happened to the metal implants he spent his working life attaching to patients.  Verberne had no idea, so he did some research and he found out that they were thrown away. ""They were basically buried,"" he says.  The value of implants collected from a crematorium is only a fraction of their value before surgery, but they are made from good quality metal that is worth recycling.  ""The operation to provide a new hip may cost you around £5,000 ($8,000. 6,000 euros),"" he explains.  ""But the return value as scrap is maybe, per kilo, around £10 ($16, 12 euros). And there are five hips per kilo!""  In 1997, Gabriels and Verberne founded OrthoMetals. Fifteen years later the company recycles more than 250 tons of metal from cremations annually, which gets used to make things like cars, planes, and even wind turbines.  The company works by collecting the metal implants for nothing, sorting them and then selling them - taking care to see that they are melted down, rather than reused.  After deducting costs, 70-75% of the proceeds are returned to the crematoria, for spending on charitable projects.  ""In the UK for example,"" he says. ""We ask for letters from charities that have received money from the organisation we work with in the UK and we see that the amount we transferred to them has been given to charity. This is a kind of controlling system that we have.""  Henry Keizer oversees a charitable memorial fund named after the first Dutch person ever cremated - a Dr Vaillant - back in 1913.  He says the fund has helped Dutch crematoria distribute money received from OrthoMetals to support everything from cancer research to school libraries.  ""I think the recycling of implants, and artificial joints, is an excellent idea,"" he says. ""Now we get to use them for good purposes, for funds for people that do social things that are extremely important.""  Michael Donohue, director of the Donohue Funeral Home in the US state of Pennsylvania, found OrthoMetals through a Google search, when the home recently built its own cremation facility.  ""Before we actually started to get up and operating, our biggest thing was - what are we going to do with the metal remains that are left at the end of the process?"" says Donohue.  Now, recovered surgical implants go back to Holland for recycling.  Donohue says his staff are candid with loved ones about this. ""We are honest with them, and tell them that whatever money is given to us goes to local organisations, and they love knowing that something from their loved one is being used in a great capacity.""  Relatively few people are cremated in the US by international standards - the figure currently stands at 40%, though the trend is upwards and there are some big geographical variations.  Recent figures show Hawaii and Nevada up near 70%, but Mississippi at less than 10%. That could be a mark of socio-economic status, says Verberne. Statistics tend to show poorer people prefer in-ground burials.  In Verberne's native Holland, some 57% of all bodies are cremated. Britain is the biggest cremator in Europe with 73%. And since the Catholic church eased its opposition to cremation, the company has seen growth in places such as Italy and Spain. In all, it operates in 15 countries.  He has some thoughts on why cremation rates are increasing in many parts of the world.  ""Two reasons are space and cost,"" he says. A traditional burial can cost four times as much as cremation. And regarding space, one survey showed 750 burials taking up an acre of ground.  Verberne also identifies some cultural changes. ""In earlier days the family would visit a grave to see dad or mum,"" he says. ""Nowadays they scatter the ashes and they are free. They want no obligations.""  Mr Verberne has no metal implants himself, but he points out his business partner's wife, who is helping sort out bits of metal at the recycling plant.  ""She has two titanium hips"", he says. ""And she was once asked: ""Isn't it strange that you know that one day your hips will run along this conveyor belt?'""  ""She said, 'No, it's just a part of life. You're going to die, and I know that reusing metals is a very good thing, so it is no problem at all.'""  She added ""'My mother's hip was on here too!'""

558,"Here it is - the first exclusive look at the new African Nations Cup trophy, which will be handed over for the first time to the winners of the 2002 finals in Mali in February.  The gold-plated trophy, designed and made in Italy by the same company who have produced the various trophies for Fifa world championships, replaces the old African Unity Cup, won outright by Cameroon last year.  Cameroon's third success in the Nations Cup since 1984 ensured they were the first country to take the trophy three times and therefore earn the right to keep it.  Runners-up Nigeria, who had previously won in 1980 and 1994, would have also kept it had they been able to overcome Cameroon in the dramatic penalty shoot-out in the final in Lagos last February.  The old African Unity Cup was a gift to the Confederation of African Football from the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa and donated ahead of the 1980 finals, hosted by Nigeria.  First trophy for the Nations Cup competition was the Abdelaziz Abdallah Salem Trophy, named after the Egyptian official who was the first elected president of Caf in 1957.  That trophy was won outright by Ghana in Libya in 1978, as they became the first country to win three Nations Cup titles. The new trophy bears no resemblance to its two predecessors. The first trophy was an old-fashioned and ornate piece of silverware with a remarkable resemblance to the English League Cup. And the second was emblazoned with the Olympic rings and with space-age handles and a long stem. It has been proudly lifted over the last two decades by legendary players such as Rabah Madjer (Algeria), Roger Milla (Cameroon), Stephen Keshi (Nigeria), Neil Tovey (South Africa), Hossam Hassan (Egypt) and most recently Rigobert Song, the captain of the 2000 Indomitable Lions."
559,"The teams, all supplied by Michelin, had been found guilty of two charges.  But a statement from Formula One's governing body the FIA said its World Motor Sport Council had voted ""overwhelmingly"" to clear all seven.  The decision appears to be the result of evidence that they could have faced criminal proceedings if they had raced.  The FIA statement said: ""Having examined new evidence, the FIA World Motor Sport Council has voted overwhelmingly to accept the recommendation of the FIA Senate regarding events at the 2005 United States Grand Prix.  The teams involved were Renault, McLaren, Toyota, Williams, Red Bull, Sauber and BAR.  They were found guilty of failing to ensure they had suitable tyres and wrongfully refusing to start the race at last month's US Grand Prix.  The Michelin-equipped teams withdrew after the formation lap at Indianapolis because the French company said it could not guarantee the safety of the tyres through the final high-speed banked corner.  Following the guilty verdict, McLaren team boss Ron Dennis and Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner met president Max Mosley and the FIA senate.  ""Nobody came out of Indianapolis with anything positive and perpetuating the negatives was clearly not constructive to Formula One,"" said Dennis.  ""I am delighted that the senate and the world council have held that way too.""  Minardi boss Paul Stoddart, whose Bridgestone-equipped team did take part in the race, said the verdict was good for everyone.  ""The most important thing out of all of this is that Formula One is a sport and we need to get on with the sport,"" he said.  ""It was the right decision and I am glad it was made now. Hopefully we can put that chapter of Formula One behind us and move on."""
560,"He was one of seven men arrested after claims that items were taken from the Harrods box, owned by Mr Al Fayed's rival Tiny Rowland in 1995.

The seven men included Mr Al Fayed's Director of Security John Macnamara, his Personal Assistant Mark Griffiths and bodyguard Paul Handley-Greaves.

561,"What do you get if you combine the world's most famous secret agent with a generous dose of Saved by the Bell ? One reaction might be to suggest TeenAgent, or any number of dubious efforts to present teenage spies. But what if it was a cartoon?  Well, what you get is a series that fills half-an-hour of a child's time and provides some harmless entertainment for any tolerant adult. James Bond Jr offered us the adventures of the famous 007's teenage nephew and gave children the chance to view action and gadgets without worrying about any restrictive film rating.  James Bond Jr, nephew to the well-known secret agent, attends a private school - Warfield Prep School - in the heart of England. The school is attended by a number of other vaguely familiar characters like IQ, grandson of Q, the Bond gadget-master, and Gordo Leiter, surfer-dude son of Bond's occasional CIA contact Felix. The programmes are also padded out with standard stereotypes like a crotchety, but occasionally reasonable, headmaster and a spoilt rich kid called Trevor Noseworthy IV.  Warfield Prep was originally a counter intelligence training base, later abandoned and converted into a school. There are still remnants of its former existence in the shape of secret passages and a helicopter-landing pad. The stock pictures, seen from beyond the perimeter wall and gates, makes the building look like a cross between a fortress and a beached naval frigate.  James is consistently interrupted from his studies by the minions of SCUM (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), who number among them familiar villains, like Goldfinger and a slightly extreme version of Jaws, and many new ones, like Dr DeRange, a barmy psychopathic French scientist-turned-villain. The organisation is run by the SCUM Lord, an imposing man in a fedora, face-scarf and purple suit, who rules from afar most of the time and pets his loyal companion Scuzball, a white, snarling pitbull terrier.  The story telling is basic at best, targeted firmly at the under-10s, and the animation is adequate. Stock images, like Warfield Prep, and car chases that lack excitement or energy are common, robbing the series of any chance to impress or excite. The plots are hammered into potential stories by way of school outings, sports trophies and exchange trips, in the way a poorly plotted fantasy novel relies on kick-starting proceedings with a stranger in an inn or a princess-kidnapping dragon. The series also lacks any of the sparkling wit and innuendo of the Bond movies, whether because of the target age group or because the writers genuinely lacked the talent or time to come up with anything better.  The characters are connected to, or converted from, the original Bond concept, with a plentiful sprinkling of individuals who tended to represent a fringe of characters more suited to battling superheroes than secret agents. This may be down to marketing executives believing that adding cybernetic limbs and lasers to anything will make it sell to the kids. Dr No, for example, has become a gaunt, green-skinned character with cybernetic claws for hands, while Jaws has had his entire jaw replaced with a metal mantrap of a mouth and sports a desperate blue suit, red shirt and yellow flower combination.  The characters are painful stereotypes filling out a school that doesn't appear to educate many vocal teenagers. The stories continuously centre around a small group with various villains popping up to cause trouble.  James Bond Jr - Action hero and star of the show, James is a capable driver and spy with a dark brown quiff and an eye for the ladies. He is frequently rescued by gadgets and good fortune rather than actual skill. Corey Burton, who provided James Bond Jr's voice, also, bizarrely, supplied the voices of the Critters from the movie of the same name. Horace Boothroyd - Educated to the point of explosion and grounded firmly in the lore of his grandfather, Q, Horace – better known as IQ – is the thinker and inventor of the group. He is constantly coming up with gadgets and is the character most likely to be left behind at school and out of the thick of the action. Jeff Bennett, who also provides the Elvisesque tones of Johnny Bravo, provided IQ's voice. Tracy Millbanks - The daughter of the headmaster, Tracy is bright, daring and willing to take the lead, presenting a reasonable sparring partner to James and an unrequited target for his affections. Gordo Leiter - A California surfer-dude with long blond hair and a tan. Common sense consistently fails him, while appearance and having a good time are paramount. Phoebe Farragut - The average Scooby-Doo Thelma-clone, she's short, bespectacled, intelligent and infatuated by members of the opposite sex who don't seem to realise she exists, like James. Trevor Noseworthy IV - Haughty, jealous and pathetic, Trevor constantly seeks attention with doubtful talents or looks to undermine the reputations of others, especially James. Mr Millbanks - A firm and uneven tempered gentleman with grey hair and a moustache, who looks like an ex-British Airforce Officer. Mr Mitchell - The physical education teacher, who is an ex-FBI agent. He has worked with James Bond himself and serves as something of a mission officer for James Bond Jr. Dr DeRange - Appropriately deranged French scientific genius and criminal mastermind. The most commonly encountered villain throughout the run of the series.  The cartoon features the most desperate accents any viewer is ever likely to suffer. All of the teenagers are supposed to have English accents except Gordo, who is equipped with a California dude tone and a lack of common sense to match. The English accents vary from the strained efforts that most English actors appear to adopt when appearing in American films, to outright caricatures of high-class backgrounds – in Trevor Noseworthy IV – and high-class education – in IQ. The accents only get worse when the villains arrive, from unconvincing Scandinavian and Germanic accents, that sound more like a clip from an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, to desperate Oriental efforts. The worst recurring accent is definitely for the villain Dr DeRange, who sounds like a poor impression of John Cleese as the French Taunter in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  All 65 episodes of the series are listed below in the order they were shown. Only slightly over a quarter of these episodes are available on video, though the whole series has been shown many times across the globe on various cartoon or children’s channels, generally during the early morning slot.  A common factor among many of the episodes is the desperate attempts at puns in the titles, which have to be read to be believed. Some of the titles are very dubious indeed, such as Dutch Treat, which sounds more like some form of exotic contraceptive or marital aid.  The videos that have been released contain a random selection of episodes rather than attempting to follow the course of the series. For example, 'The Beginning' was released on a tape along with 'Appointment in Macau' and 'A Race with Disaster'.  Without doubt the biggest opportunity for the James Bond Jr phenomenon was riding the wave of popularity in the parent character and giving children the chance to enjoy spies and adventure as well. Action figures and vehicles, picture and storybooks, clothes and bedding, videos and computer games rapidly followed release of the cartoon. Every chance was taken to bleed the licence for every cent it was worth and, for a time, playgrounds across the world were adrift with James Bond Jr merchandise. However, like every fad before and since, interest died and the baton was passed to the next big thing, leaving Bond to dwindle into obscurity and his toys and videos drifting into the bargain bucket."

Earlier in the day, Ms Goody visited a children's charity that she works with and made a donation.  ""After visiting these children, I realised how small my problems are. They are nothing compared to what these children go through,"" she said.  Ms Goody denied that her visit to India and the donating of money to the charity amounted to a publicity stunt.  ""This is not a publicity stunt. Nobody knew I was coming here. It was a private visit. If I wanted, I could have got the UK magazines to come here with me,"" she said.  ""The money I'm giving to the charity is because I want to help these underprivileged children,"" she added.  Ms Goody, who is in India on a four-day visit, said on this occasion she is ""busy with my charity work and will not be able to meet Shilpa [Shetty]"".  She arrived in Delhi on Monday and hours after her arrival, she was spotted having lunch at a restaurant at her hotel.  Since the news of Ms Goody's arrival spread, her every move has attracted media attention with dozens of camera crews following her every step.  She is accompanied by three people, including two British Asians.  The way that Ms Goody and some of the other Big Brother contestants treated Ms Shetty resulted in more than 40,000 people complaining to the UK media regulator, Ofcom.  That led to Ms Goody denying being racist. But she apologised for referring to Ms Shetty as ""Shilpa Poppadom"" and other remarks.  The controversy made front-page news in India but reaction among ordinary Indians to the row was generally muted.  On leaving the Big Brother house, the 25-year-old said her behaviour was ""nasty"" adding: ""I'm not racist, but I can see why it has had the impact it's had.""  Shilpa Shetty was almost unheard of in the UK outside the British Asian community before she entered the Big Brother competition.  She soon became a household name. After she won the contest she was invited to visit the Houses of Parliament and to take tea with Prime Minister Tony Blair."
563,"A cargo plane has crash-landed in high winds at Japan's largest airport, killing both crew members on board.  The accident happened as the Federal Express plane arrived at Narita international airport, near Tokyo, from Guangzhou in China.  Japan's public broadcaster NHK showed dramatic footage of the plane bouncing as it landed on the runway, then bursting into flames.  Dozens of flights have been cancelled as one runway at Narita remains closed.  The accident happened at about 0650 local time on Monday (2150 GMT Sunday).  The two crew were taken to hospital but both were confirmed dead.  Officials said the pilot, Kevin Kyle Mosley, was 54 years old and the co-pilot, Anthony Stephen Pino, was 49. Both were American.  Footage of the crash shows the plane landing hard, tipping on to its left wing and bursting into flame as it then rolled over.  The plane landed in strong winds, of up to 72 km (45 miles) per hour, and Japan's meteorological agency had issued a gale warning for the area around Narita.  ""We have information that strong winds caused the plane to divert from the runway,"" a Narita Airport spokeswoman told reporters.  But officials said it was too soon to confirm if the winds caused the crash.  The jet was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, according to Japan's Kyodo News.  Airlines have cancelled more than 30 flights and diverted others to nearby airports, because Narita's longest runway remains closed.  Parts of the wreckage were still burning hours after the crash.  Kyodo News said it was the first fatal aircraft accident at Narita Airport since it opened in 1978."
564,"There has been a direct bomb attack on the British Government at the Conservative party conference in Brighton.  At least two people have been killed and many others seriously injured, including two senior Cabinet ministers.  The blast tore apart the Brighton Grand Hotel where members of the Cabinet have been staying for the Conservative party conference.  The IRA has issued a statement claiming it had placed a 100lb bomb in the hotel.  The statement read: ""Today we were unlucky, but remember, we only have to be lucky once; you will have to be lucky always. Give Ireland peace and there will be no war.""  The dead have not yet been named. Among the injured were Trade and Industry Secretary Norman Tebbit, his wife Margaret and Government Chief Whip, John Wakeham.  Firemen used BBC arc lights after cables were cut to rescue Mr Tebbit from the rubble, in a painstaking operation that took several hours.  Breakfast television showed pictures of the rescue and a conscious Mr Tebbit, clearly in pain, being stretchered to safety. His wife suffered neck injuries.  The bomb went off at 0254 local time, ripping open the front of the hotel on the top floors and sending masonry crashing down on guests sleeping below.  Fireman say many lives were probably saved because the well-constructed Victorian hotel remained standing, despite the central section of eight floors collapsing into the basement.  At Mrs Thatcher's insistence the conference opened on schedule at 0930. In her redrafted speech to the party she declared:  ""This attack has failed. All attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.""  The Queen was said to be ""very shocked"" by the bombing. Opposition Leader Neil Kinnock expressed his ""horror and outrage"".  Meanwhile security in the seaside town has been massively increased as rescue workers continue to search for people trapped in the rubble.  Detectives are now beginning a major investigation into who was behind the bombing and how such a major breach in security occurred."
565,"The Channel 4 presenter said quitting ITV was like being ""on that last lifeboat that left the Titanic"" as ""it couldn't really sink any lower"".  O'Grady received an honour which marked a decade ""at the top"" of broadcasting.  EastEnders was named top soap, with ITV rival Coronation Street winning best soap actor and best soap storyline.  Cult BBC sci-fi series Doctor Who won best-loved drama award, with its stars David Tennant and Billie Piper taking best actor and actress.  ""It was very hard to step into something that had been such a success already,"" said 35-year-old Tennant, who took over the title role from Christopher Eccleston late last year.  ""It was very daunting and because of that, this means a lot.""  Piper, 23, who played the doctor's assistant Rose Tyler, left the show earlier this year ahead of the third series.  O'Grady thanked Channel 4 ""for taking a clapped-out 51-year-old who's had two heart attacks and sticking it on teatime"".  And he said his award had ""taken the sting out of the rotten things that have happened"".  BBC One's EastEnders won best soap for the first time since 2003, with 19-year-old Charlie Clements receiving best soap newcomer for his role as banker Bradley Branning.  The Alzheimer's ordeal and subsequent death of character Mike Baldwin - played by Johnny Briggs - earned Coronation Street the best soap storyline.  Ursula Holden-Gill, 32, won best soap actress as Alice Dingle in Emmerdale. Her character died in the ITV1 show after battling with the rare cancer Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  Noel Edmonds, 56, beat O'Grady to the title of best daytime show with Channel 4 show Deal or No Deal.  ITV1's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here received the award for best reality show.  Little Britain won best comedy while CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the Las Vegas-based forensics drama, was named top international series."
566,"In the second of five pieces by photographers talking about their award-winning work, Frank Fournier describes how he captured the tragic image of 13-year-old Omayra Sanchez trapped in debris caused by a mudslide following the eruption of a volcano in Colombia in 1985.  Red Cross rescue workers had apparently repeatedly appealed to the government for a pump to lower the water level and for other help to free the girl. Finally rescuers gave up and spent their remaining time with her, comforting her and praying with her. She died of exposure after about 60 hours.  The picture had tremendous impact when it was published. Television cameras had already relayed Omayra's agony into homes around the world.  When the photo was published, many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra's life. They pointed out that technology had been able to capture her image for all time and transmit it around the globe, but was unable to save her life.  I arrived in Bogota from New York about two days after the volcanic eruption. The area I needed to get to was very remote. It involved a five-hour drive and then about two and a half hours walking.  I reached the town of Ameroyo at dawn about three days after the explosion. There was a lot of confusion - people were in shock and in desperate need of help. Many were trapped by debris.  I met a farmer who told me of this young girl who needed help. He took me to her, she was almost on her own at the time, just a few people around and some rescuers helping someone else a bit further away.  She was in a large puddle, trapped from the waist down by concrete and other debris from the collapsed houses. She had been there for almost three days. Dawn was just breaking and the poor girl was in pain and very confused.  Then there was this little girl and people were powerless to help her. The rescuers kept coming back to her, local farmers and some people who had some medical aid. They tried to comfort her.  When I took the pictures I felt totally powerless in front of this little girl, who was facing death with courage and dignity. She could sense that her life was going.  I felt that the only thing I could do was to report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl and hope that it would mobilise people to help the ones that had been rescued and had been saved.  I felt I had to report what this little girl had to go through.  By this stage, Omayra was drifting in and out of consciousness. She even asked me if I could take her to school because she was worried that she would be late.  I gave my film to some photographers who were going back to the airport and had them shipped back to my agent in Paris. Omayra died about three hours after I got there.  At the time, I didn't realise how powerful the photograph was - the way in which the little girl's eye connect with the camera.  People were asking: ""Why didn't you help her? Why didn't you get her out?"" But it was impossible.  There was an outcry - debates on television on the nature of the photojournalist, how much he or she is a vulture. But I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it.  I am very clear about what I do and how I do it, and I try to do my job with as much honesty and integrity as possible. I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country's leaders. There was an obvious lack of leadership. There were no evacuation plans, yet scientists had foreseen the catastrophic extent of the volcano's eruption.  People still find the picture disturbing. This highlights the lasting power of this little girl. I was lucky that I could act as a bridge to link people with her. It's the magic of the thing.  There are hundreds of thousands of Omayras around the world - important stories about the poor and the weak and we photojournalists are there to create the bridge.  The question of the power of the press is more important today that it ever has been because it is so much under pressure from the business side of things.   "
567,"The Periodic Table will be one element longer Discovered 13 years ago, and officially added to the periodic table just weeks ago, element 112 finally has a name. It will be called ""copernicium"", with the symbol Cn, in honour of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus deduced that the planets revolved around the Sun, and finally refuted the belief that the Earth was the centre of the Universe. The team of scientists who discovered the element chose the name to honour the man who ""changed our world view"". The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) will officially endorse the new element's name in six months' time in order to give the scientific community ""time to discuss the suggestion"". Scientists from the Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany, led by Professor Sigurd Hofmann, discovered copernicium in fusion experiments in 1996. ""After IUPAC officially recognised our discovery, we agreed on proposing the name (because) we would like to honour an outstanding scientist,"" said Professor Hofmann. Copernicus was born 1473 in Torun, Poland. His finding that the planets circle the sun underpins much of modern science. It was pivotal for the discovery of gravity, and led to the conclusion that the stars are incredibly far away and that the Universe is inconceivably large. Under IUPAC rules, the team were not allowed to name the element after a living person. But when asked if, rules aside, he would have liked to have ""hofmanium"" added to the periodic table, Professor Hofmann told BBC News: ""No, I think copernicium sounds much better.""     "
568,"The survey was conducted on brothels in the London area London's brothel industry has spread to ""every corner"" of the city, according to a charity's report. Brothels in the city offer sex for as little as £15, and some are charging £10 extra for unprotected intercourse, the Poppy Project in Southwark found. Its report said 85% of brothels in the city operated in residential areas and researchers posing as sex buyers found brothels in all 33 London boroughs. Westminster had the highest number with 71, compared with eight in Southwark. The study was compiled by the Poppy Project, which provides education about prostitution and helps victims of sex trafficking. Researchers posing as potential punters telephoned 921 brothels that had advertised in local newspapers. They found on average 28 brothels in each borough. Together the brothels generated between £50m and £130m a year, the researchers estimated. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Campaigners insisted this was just ""the tip of the iceberg"" as the only source of information was newspaper adverts, as opposed to websites or phone box cards. Many operated through legitimate businesses - licensed as saunas or massage parlours - though the vast majority were in private flats in residential areas. The report found 77 different ethnicities among women being offered for sex, many from areas such as eastern Europe and south-east Asia. The average age of the women was 21. Several places offered ""very, very young girls"" but did not admit to having underage girls available. For most women involved in prostitution, the reality is a cycle of violence and coercion, perpetuated by poverty and inequality    According to the researchers, the average price for full sex was about £62. Co-author Helen Atkins said: ""This research shows the disturbing prevalence of the sex industry in every corner of London - fuelled by the demand for prostitution services. ""Multi-media misrepresentations of commercial sex as a glamorous, easy and fun career choice for girls and women further contribute to the ubiquity of London's brothel industry. ""However, for most women involved in prostitution, the reality is a cycle of violence and coercion, perpetuated by poverty and inequality."" Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said there was ""a large and growing number"" of very young women being trafficked into the UK. While visiting the project she said she met two women who were brought into the country at the age of 17 ""thinking that they were going to come here for a chance for education"". They ""were tricked and then forced into prostitution"" she said.     "
569,"A married father-of-four faces a life behind bars for a series of horrific rapes and murders.  The Old Bailey jury found David Mulcahy guilty of the rape and murder of three women, seven more rapes and five counts of conspiracy to rape.  The court had heard that Mulcahy had ""hunted"" women in and around London with his childhood friend John Duffy - the so-called ""railway rapist"", now serving life imprisonment for rape and murder.  Mulcahy, a 41-year-old builder of Chalk Farm, north London, had planned a number of the attacks in the 1980s with his ""wicked soulmate"", the jury heard. As youths Duffy and Mulcahy used to go out shooting at people with air rifles. Their friendship continued after they both got married and used to go out together at weekends. Giving evidence in Mulcahy's trial, Duffy said: ""We would plan it quite meticulously. ""We would have balaclavas and knives. We used to call it hunting. We did it as a bit of a joke. A bit of a game."" In July 1984 the pair raped two girls on Hampstead Heath.  ""We were very excited we had two victims. We thought it was great really,"" said Duffy. He said the two men had laughed about the rapes afterwards while listening to Michael Jackson tapes. In 1985, the pair turned to murder. Alison Day, was just 19 years old when she was raped and strangled at Hackney Wick station, east London, in December 1985. The following April, schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer, 15, was attacked by the men as she went to the shops to buy sweets. She too was raped and strangled near her home in Horsley, Surrey.  A month later in May 1986, newly-married TV presenter Anne Lock, 29, was killed by Mulcahy - probably suffocated - as she returned to her home at Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire. John Duffy, 41, was jailed for life in 1988 for two of the murders but cleared of killing Anne Lock. He had attacked more than 20 women - most aged between 15 and 32 - at railway stations in and around London and became known as the ""railway rapist"". Mulcahy's part in the appalling crimes was only revealed by Duffy while in prison."
570,"Dutch MEP Paul van Buitenen has published a confidential internal report on abuse of staff allowances described by a colleague as ""dynamite"". The report highlights money paid for non-existent staff via a system of ""service providers"" or accountants. He posted a short summary of the report on his website and could face a reprimand for breaching secrecy. British Euro MP Chris Davies who leaked details of the document last month said he was delighted it was now public. ""Paul's here as a whistle-blower. They [senior parliament officials] will be angry about this but only because they will look stupid,"" he said. Among the revelations made by the internal auditors are a large number of lay-off payments made to staff of MEPs who were not re-elected. Ten were made to assistants even though they were working for another MEP. And one member of staff is said to have accumulated part-time payments from 12 MEPs over a three-month period. It's been handled very badly. This drip, drip, drip is not helpful    The auditors also refer to abuse of travel costs and expenses. In one case, the expenses amount to three times the staff member's salary. Not everyone on the budgetary control committee is impressed with Mr van Buitenen's decision to go public with the report. Fellow Dutch MEP Jan Mulder, who had originally been in favour of making the details public, said he would not have breached the secrecy order. ""If I've signed for it, then I would keep it confidential,"" he said. British Labour MEP Eluned Morgan said she had written personally to Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering, calling for the report to be made public. ""It's been handled very badly. This drip, drip, drip is not helpful. I think it should be published [in full], there's no question about that at all. This will have taken away any excuse."" A spokesman for Mr Poettering said if the rules on confidentiality had been broken, it would be up to the committee's chairman to make a complaint. Mr van Buitenen is no stranger to censure at the hands of the EU's institutions. He was formally reprimanded a few months ago after he publicised an account of a meeting held behind closed doors with the head of the EU's anti-fraud office, Olaf. More famously, he was suspended in 1999 while working as an official at the European Commission after he passed allegations of fraud in the commission on to the parliament.     "
571,"Jack Sadler was on top of a Land Rover when it hit a mine An admission that a ""cut and shut"" helicopter was used in Afghanistan has angered the father of a dead soldier. Ian Sadler, from Exmouth, has been openly critical of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) since his son Jack, 21, died in Afghanistan in December 2007. The MoD told Mr Sadler the helicopter was a combination of a crashed RAF Chinook and an Argentinian Chinook. An MoD spokesman told BBC News the work had been done by ""highly skilled aviation technicians"". The spokesman said the helicopter had been withdrawn from Afghanistan, but was still in service. The front of the helicopter was from an RAF Chinook which crashed in Oman in 1999 when its rear blades touched the ground, ripping out one of the engines. The rear of the aircraft was taken from a former Argentinian Air Force Chinook helicopter which was seized in June 1982 during the recapture of the Falklands. The MoD said it re-entered service in 2003 after being successfully air tested. The information was disclosed in a letter to Mr Sadler in response to a direct question he asked the former defence secretary Des Brown during a meeting on 9 September last year. ""It was a soldier on rest and recuperation (R and R) from Afghanistan who came into my shop and passed on the information that a cut and shut helicopter was being used,"" Mr Sadler told BBC News. ""There've been lots of things that have come out since Jack was killed, but I couldn't believe this"" Mr Sadler told BBC News. Mr Sadler's son, a trooper in the Honourable Artillery Company, was killed when his non-armoured Land Rover hit a mine. The MoD said using parts from two helicopters was ""the most timely and cost-effective solution"" to returning the aircraft to service. A spokesman said: ""The work was conducted by highly skilled aviation technicians and the aircraft returned to service after extensive air testing and signing off by the Aircraft Design Authority, Boeing. He said it was ""routine business"" for the RAF to ensure the most effective use of resources. If you gave them flip flops and catapults they'd still go out there and do the job for us    But Mr Sadler said it was a ""real scandal"" and showed a lack of support for the troops fighting in Afghanistan. ""There are about 8,000 troops at war in Afghanistan without proper support,"" Mr Sadler said. He said the responsibility lies with the ""people at the top who control the purse strings"". ""We've got soldiers we don't deserve, who go through the next best thing to hell out there.

573,"Busted have announced a reunion tour for 2016, 11 years after Charlie Simpson left and the band imploded.  The rock-pop boyband sold five million records at the start of the millennium, scoring number one hits with Year 3000 and What I Go To School For.  But Simpson walked out after a record-breaking 12-night engagement at Wembley Arena, saying his time in the band was ""like torture"".  Busted will pick up where they left off, playing Wembley on 11 May, 2016.  The reunion was sparked by a road trip to Philadelphia, where the trio - Simpson, Matt Willis and James Bourne - recorded ""three or four"" new songs.  ""I was astounded to find out James had actually been listening to a lot of the same music I'd been listening to,"" said Simpson. ""When I left the band in 2005, we were worlds away creatively.  ""It was quite poignant to think that we'd landed 10 years later and there was some creative common ground.""  ""It was just a really fun time,"" added Bourne. ""It felt like we were just hanging out with old, good friends.""  The band announced their comeback at the Soho Hotel in London - the same venue where they revealed their break-up in January 2005.  A dedicated group of two dozen fans waited for the band outside, after travelling from across the UK in anticipation of the reunion.  ""It's magical!"" said Rebecca, who had travelled to London from Ireland. ""We're going to wet ourselves!""  ""Busted are my entire life,"" said London-based Melissa. ""They've always amazed me, no matter what they've done. Solo, in different bands, they've always been so good to me.""  ""It's been 11 years, nearly, which is too long to wait,"" said Roxy, from Oxford. ""I feel like it's going to be different this time - because when they were Busted before, we were all kids and now we're adults. So it's a different audience they're going for.""  Speaking at the press conference, Simpson said he was surprised as anyone by his return to the pop band - after carving out a successful rock career in Fightstar.  ""I've lost count of the number of times where I've said publicly I wouldn't do this again. But I have changed my mind.""  ""We went to Philadelphia, we wrote new music and that changed everything. I was very ready to go to Philadelphia and come away thinking 'it just doesn't feel right'.  ""The fact that it did feel right is just as much of a shock to me as it is to anyone sitting in this room today.""  The band promised new material to accompany their tour, acknowledging that their back catalogue was currently rather meagre.  ""Busted only had two albums,"" said Willis, who said the group would have to ""play every song that you know then start all over again"" on their 13-date tour.  When Busted split in 2005, they were one of the biggest bands in the UK, with two multi-platinum albums and two Brit Awards.  Simpson continued to make music, both with Fightstar and as a solo artist. Willis won the 2006 series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here and appeared in the West End production of Wicked, while Bourne wrote songs for Melanie C, The Jonas Brothers and his own band Son of Dork.  In 2014, Willis and Bourne formed the seven-piece ""supergroup"" McBusted with the members of fellow boy-band McFly, releasing a top 10 album and supporting One Direction on tour.  According to media reports at the time, Simpson sold his share of the Busted copyright to his former bandmates for a six-figure sum to enable the supergroup's formation.  Speaking in London, the band confessed that the deal remained a grey area in their reunion plans.  ""We haven't really spoken about that,"" Simpson said. ""That's pretty low down the list of priorities.""  ""Charlie now works for us,"" Willis joked. ""He's on a very tight leash."""

Police said they were investigating how the glass came to be there.  The plaque, placed where 18-year-old Stephen was killed in 1993, has been targeted three times since 1995.  No arrests have been made over the incident.  Since the plaque was unveiled in the teenager's memory it has been chipped and had paint and flammable liquids poured on it.

576,"One of the world's oldest commercial computers has been brought back to life by two enthusiasts in a barn in Kent.  The ICT1301 computer, known as Flossie, was restored to working order on its 50th anniversary by engineers Roger Holmes and Rod Brown in Bethersden.  The 20ft (6m) by 22ft machine was built to replace rows of clerks doing office work and featured in the 1974 James Bond film The Man With The Golden Gun.  Bought for £200 in 2003, it has 100th of the power of a smartphone.  Mr Holmes, a Computer Conservation Society volunteer, said it was a unique machine important for putting modern technology into context.  He said he was negotiating with various organisations to find it a new home.  ""It's a big beast. I would like it go somewhere they will continue to keep it running,"" he said.  ""If it is kept behind a case, people will not be able to experience what it was like in the 1960s.  ""With it working, people can walk in, hear it, smell it and almost taste it and have a flavour of how it was back then.""  Flossie originally cost £250,000 to build in 1962, the equivalent of £4.2m today.  It has 100,000 punch cards and 27 reels of magnetic tape, both to record data, and its 12 kilobytes of memory alone weigh half a tonne.  Each piece of memory has five lengths of wire threaded by hand.  Mr Brown said: ""You have to remember that file reels in those days were multi-reel, so at 10 meg a reel, 27 reels, we're up to a quarter of a gigabyte - and 50 years ago that was a lot of data.""  Mr Holmes said Flossie took the drudgery out of office work in the 1960s, but also cost jobs.  ""Before this, there were huge great rooms 100ft square full of clerks doing nothing but calculation, and recording things, and taking the files out, and changing them, and putting them back again - and they all became redundant,"" he said.  Flossie was used as a prop in Bond film The Man With The Golden Gun starring Roger Moore and also in two BBC TV series - Doctor Who and Blake's 7."
577,"European Jewish and Muslim groups have joined forces to defend circumcision for young boys on religious grounds after a German regional court ruled it amounted to bodily harm.  A joint statement says the practice is fundamental to their faiths and calls for it to be awarded legal protection.  The ruling by the Cologne court - also criticised by the Israeli parliament - does not apply to the whole of Germany.  But Germany's Medical Association told doctors not to perform circumcisions.  Thousands of Muslim and Jewish boys are circumcised in Germany every year.  The unusual joint statement was signed by leaders of groups including the Rabbinical Centre of Europe, the European Jewish Parliament, the European Jewish Association, Germany's Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs and the Islamic Centre Brussels.  ""We consider this to be an affront (to) our basic religious and human rights,"" it said.  ""Circumcision is an ancient ritual that is fundamental to our individual faiths and we protest in the strongest possible terms against this court ruling.  ""To that end we will vigorously defend our right to maintain our mutual tradition and call on the German parliament and all political parties to intervene in overruling this decision as a matter of urgency.""  The leaders also met members of the European parliament and the Bundestag to express their anger and insist that the German parliament establish clear legal protections for the rite.  The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says the German government is clearly uneasy about the ruling, particularly after accusations that it was inappropriate for the country of the Holocaust to outlaw a fundamental ritual of Judaism.  The ruling by the Cologne court followed a legal case involving a doctor who carried out a circumcision on a four year-old that led to medical complications.  The court said that a child's right to physical integrity trumped religious and parental rights.  The doctor involved in the case was acquitted and the ruling was not binding. However, critics fear it could set a precedent that could be followed by other German courts."

It said the full tram-train service would ""not be introduced until 2017"".  An application to connect both the tram and rail networks at Tinsley was submitted on 13 March.  In a statement, Network Rail said: ""The combination of the complexity of the project, added to the need to apply for powers to build the link between the two networks means that the full tram-train service will not be introduced until 2017.  ""We apologise for this delay but remain positive that the introduction of tramtrain will not only benefit passengers in South Yorkshire but lead the way for many other similar schemes to benefit passengers around the country.""  The two-year pilot scheme is said to be the first of its kind in the UK.  The tram-trains are expected to cut journey times and make it easier for people to get into the city and town centres.  They are said to be lighter, more energy efficient and have faster acceleration and deceleration than conventional trains."
579,"One man was killed, 153 people were injured and some 800 arrests were made as the Russians resisted the removal of the bronze statue of a soldier.  Estonians say the memorial symbolised Soviet occupation. Supporters say it celebrated heroes who fought the Nazis.  The dead man has been named by the Russian embassy in Tallinn as Dmitriy Ganin, 20, an ethnic Russian who was permanently resident in Estonia and held Russian citizenship.  Estonian authorities have said he was stabbed by another demonstrator and that police had no involvement in his death.  There have been unconfirmed reports of a second death, but the Estonian government has denied this.  Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed ""serious concern"" about the events during a phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Kremlin statement said.  The monument was removed on Friday and taken to a secret location.  Correspondents said a crowd of more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered on Friday evening where the monument used to stand.  Some of the protesters threw petrol bombs, while others waved Russian flags and chanted ""Russia, Russia, Russia"".  Department stores and other shops in the city centre were looted.  There were also reports of rioting and looting in the towns of Johvi and Kohtla-Jarve, in a mainly ethnic Russian region east of Tallinn.  AFP news agency said that in Johvi looters set fire to a statue of an Estonian general who fought the Russians during the country's 1918 war of independence.  By Saturday morning the situation in central Tallinn was described as calm, but the authorities are braced for more trouble.  Squads of police were seen moving around the area where the memorial used to stand.  The decision to remove the Soviet monument has strained relations with Russia, which called it ""blasphemous"".  And for local ethnic Russians it is one insult too many, the BBC's Richard Galpin says, after what they feel has been years of discrimination against them by the majority Estonian population.  More than a quarter of Estonia's 1.3m people are ethnically Russian, and speak the language.  However, half of them do not have Estonian citizenship.  But the Estonians believe much of the tension is being whipped up by forces outside the country, i.e. Russia itself.  During the years of Soviet occupation after World War II, tens of thousands of Estonians were killed. And they say their country was effectively colonised with many Russians being brought in as workers and military personnel.  Estonia's government would not reveal where it took the six-foot (1.83m) statue, but spokesman Martin Jasko said it would ultimately be placed at the military cemetery in Tallinn.  The memorial, a bronze statue of a Soviet soldier, was erected in 1947. The remains of Soviet soldiers are thought to be buried nearby."
580,"Two familiar faces are returning briefly to Walford later this year as part of an explosive storyline involving the Beale family. John Partridge and Lynda Baron are both set to reprise their roles as Christian and Linda Clarke, the brother and mother of Jane Beale.  We're staying tight-lipped on the details surrounding their return for now, but the shocking storyline is set to change the Beale family forever…  Christian and was last seen in the Square back in 2015 when he attended the wedding of Ian and Jane as part of the 30th anniversary live week."
581,"A conservative German anti-euro party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), has won seats in two more regional parliaments.  Local elections in eastern Germany on Sunday gave the AfD 12.2% in Brandenburg and 10.6% in Thuringia.  The party entered a regional parliament for the first time two weeks ago in Saxony - another eastern German state.  The AfD is mounting a growing challenge to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. It wants to scrap the euro and sees law and order as a priority.  The party is attracting right-wing supporters, while avoiding links with nationalist extremists.  The Social Democrats (SPD) won in Brandenburg with 32% and are set to remain in power in coalition with the socialist Die Linke who polled 18.9%.  The Christian Democrats (CDU), polled 33.5% in Thuringia, only a few points ahead of Die Linke, who won 28% of the vote.  Until now, the CDU has been in coalition with the SPD in Thuringia but could lose the state to Die Linke if the Social Democrats switch allegiances.  The staunchly pro-euro CDU refuses to form any coalition with the AfD.  The AfD was among many Eurosceptic parties which made large gains in the European elections in May.  The AfD, founded just over a year ago, has seven seats now in the European Parliament. Its MEPs sit in the same grouping as the UK Conservatives, demanding fundamental reform of the EU.  The party campaigns against bailouts for southern European countries, angry that taxpayers' money has been used to save the euro.  ""We are the force that's renewing the political landscape,"" said AfD leader Bernd Lucke, 52, an economics professor.  ""One can't deny it anymore: the citizens are thirsting for political change,"" he said."
582,"The American intelligence agency, the CIA, could have prevented the 11 September attacks if it were not for systematic failures, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit.  The paper has uncovered details of a major Israeli spy ring involving some a 120 agents for the intelligence service Mossad operating across America and some masquerading as arts students.  The ring was reportedly hard on the heels of at least four members of the hijack gang, including its leader Mohammed Atta.  But the Israeli agents were detected by their American counterparts and thrown out of the country, it says.  The US authorities said then that they were students whose visas had expired.  Just a month before the deadly attacks, the paper said, Mossad handed over to the Americans a detailed report naming several suspects they believe were preparing an attack on the United States.  But it contained no specific indications as to the objective and it was not treated seriously.  The paper also claims that the CIA failed to inform the German authorities that Ramzi Binalshibh, a key logistics man for the attacks, had attended a high level meeting of al-Qaeda activists in Malaysia over 18 months before 11 September.  Without that information the Germans could not prevent him re-entering the country and contacting the Hamburg cell that was planning the hijackings."
583,"Hasanuddin, 34, was given 20 years for planning the attack, while two accomplices were given 14 years.  Hasanuddin had earlier told the court he helped plan the attack but rejected allegations he masterminded it.  The beheading of the girls, attacked as they walked to school in Poso in 2005, drew international condemnation.  It also fanned tensions in Sulawesi, where Muslim-Christian violence has continued despite a 2002 peace deal.  Hasanuddin's denial was rejected by chief judge Binsar Siregar, who said: ""The accused was proven to plan and move other people to carry out terror acts.""  The court in Jakarta was also told that Hasanuddin had left a message next to the severed heads of the girls, saying: ""A life for a life. A head for a head"".  A separate court sentenced defendants Irwanto Irano and Lilik Purwanto to 14 years each.  Speaking before his sentencing, Hasanuddin said going to jail did not concern him.  ""It's not a problem (if I am being sentenced to prison) because this is a part of our struggle. What will become a problem is if our brothers decide to get revenge,"" he said.  The three girls were attacked as they walked to the private Christian school near their home in Poso. One of their heads was discovered outside a church.  The trial had been told that the attack was timed to take place during a festival at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  Hasanuddin said he wanted to avenge the deaths of Muslims killed during previous religious violence in the country, the world's most populous Muslim nation.  More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed during two years of violence triggered by a brawl between Christian and Muslim gangs in December 1998.  Tensions have risen in recent months following the execution of three Christian militants in September 2006, for attacks against Muslims in 2000."
584,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Two German ships have become the first Western commercial vessels to navigate the Northeast Passage - a shipping route which goes from Asia to Europe around the Russian Arctic. One of the captains told the BBC that their journey opened new, exciting possibilities for the whole international shipping community. Valeriy Durov, shipmaster of The Beluga Foresight, is your archetypal captain: a short man with a big moustache and a sense of great authority in his voice. ""I was slightly surprised by what we saw,"" he told us as we stood on the bridge of his cargo lifter. ""There was virtually no ice on most of the route. Twenty years ago, when I worked in the eastern part of the Arctic, I couldn't even imagine something like this. ""I think it will soon be possible to navigate the Northeast Passage all year round. We were escorted by an ice-breaker but, frankly, we could have done without it. This is great news for our industry."" Mr Durov's ship had just arrived in Arkhangel, a major sea port in north-western Russia. It was met by a cold, unpleasant drizzle and grey autumnal skies. It will signal the rebirth of this shipping route, and the renaissance of the whole of the Russian North    The numerous potholes on the port's berths had turned into deep puddles. To get to the mooring wall, you had to jump over them, navigating around endless stacks of pipes, wood planks and containers rather like a character in an old-fashioned computer game. The scene was anything but glamorous. But it deserved so much more. The Beluga Foresight is one of those ships that make history. Experts in Russia say its journey from South Korea to the Russian North was a real breakthrough.    In the past, no foreign ships were allowed to cross the Northeast Passage. But now Russia's security concerns have given way to the desire for a slice of the fat pie which is the international shipping business. ""This is an event of huge strategic importance,"" said chief commercial officer of the Arkhangel Sea Port Viktor Vorobyov. ""It will signal the rebirth of this shipping route, and the renaissance of the whole of the Russian North."" Mr Vorobyov hopes that his port will soon become a major hub for trans-continental shipping. And, from the business point of view, this would make perfect sense. The German freighters were accompanied by Russian icebreakers Going via the Russian Arctic cuts the distance from, say, South Korea to the Netherlands by up to 25%. This means the time in transit can be cut by as much as 10 days. And, as Captain Durov points out, ""it is much safer up north: there are no pirates"". The Beluga Foresight is, then, setting a very important precedent. Whether other ships will follow in its wake is still unclear: industry insiders point out that Russia's Arctic infrastructure is virtually non-existent, while the bureaucratic procedures are complicated, costly and time-consuming. But the opportunity is now there. And - as far as sailors are concerned - a fanfare for a triumph of shipping might be in order. For environmentalists, however, this journey is more of a call for alarm bells. ""This is a very clear signal of how weak the Arctic ice has become,"" says Alexei Kokorin of WWF Russia. The Northeast Passage route has alarmed some conservationists ""The area of really heavy ice in the Arctic is now 10 times smaller than 10 or 20 years ago. Global warming is becoming more and more dominant - and it will affect all of us"". Some experts predict that there will probably be no ice at all left in the Arctic within the next few decades. This might be good news for people like Captain Durov who will no longer have to keep a copy of Navigating Through Ice next to his seat on the bridge. But it might also spell disaster for low-lying areas around the world, from Dhaka to London.     "
585,"Saltwater crocodiles enjoy catching a wave and can travel hundreds of kilometres by ""surfing"" on ocean currents, a study suggests.  Australian researchers used sonar sensors and satellite transmitters to monitor 20 reptiles' movements.  They found the crocodiles undertook numerous trips of over 10km (6.2 miles), but only when a current flowed in their direction of travel.  The results of the research appear in the Journal of Animal Ecology.  The TV personality Steve Irwin, who was nicknamed The Crocodile Hunter, but died in 2006, took part in the study.  Estuarine or saltwater crocodiles are the world's largest reptiles and can grow up to 5.5m in length.  They are poor swimmers and despite their name, they inhabit fresh water as well as estuaries. Their ""home"" range, however, spans over thousands of kilometres of South-East Asia.  Researchers have long been puzzled by how crocodiles managed to spread themselves so widely.  ""Of all the amazing things animals can do, the ability of certain species to migrate significant distances across formidable geographical barriers is one of the most remarkable,"" write the authors of the recent study.  Although the crocodiles spend most of their life in salt water, they are not considered marine animals as they rely on land for food and water.  During the research, a team led by Dr Hamish Campbell, from the University of Queensland, captured 20 crocodiles living in the North Kennedy tidal river in Queensland, northern Australia, and tagged them with satellite transmitters.  They found that during the period of study, eight of them ventured out into the open ocean. One travelled from the river mouth all the way to the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland's far north. That amounts to a total of 590km covered over 25 days.  To do that, the ocean-trotter hitched a ride on a current within the Gulf of Carpentaria (that separates Cape York from Arnhem Land, to the west). This current occurs seasonally, during the summer monsoon.  ""[These crocodiles] can survive for long periods in saltwater without eating or drinking, so by only travelling when surface currents are favourable, they would be able to move long distances by sea,"" commented Dr Campbell.  It took another adventurer - a 4.84m-long male - just 20 days to go more than 411km from from the east coast of Australia's Cape York Peninsula through the Torres Strait (which divides Australia from New Guinea) to the Wenlock River on the west coast of Cape York.  When the crocodile arrived in the Torres Strait, strong currents were flowing in the opposite direction to where it was headed.  So the animal waited in a sheltered bay for four days and continued its trip when the currents changed direction.  The scientists also tagged 27 crocodiles with sonar transmitters and spent a year tracking their every move inside the North Kennedy River with underwater receivers.  They found that both male and female crocodiles regularly travelled more than 50km from home, swimming to the river mouth and back.  But the team discovered that crocodiles would only set out on a long journey within an hour of the tide changing. This allowed them to ""catch a wave"".  They put their trips on hold when the tides reversed, moving out of the river and on to the banks.  Dr Campbell said that the results of the study gave important clues to understanding the evolution of the world's largest reptiles.  ""This not only helps to explains how estuarine crocodiles move between oceanic islands, but also contributes to the theory that crocodilians have crossed major marine barriers during their evolutionary past,"" he said."
586,"This investigation was instigated by a whistleblower inside the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in London, who came forward with reports about corruption and criminality. What we found out went further than we anticipated.  I became a parking attendant (PA) working for APCOA in Kensington and Chelsea.  A substantial part of our training was on how to deal with abuse from the public and there are three assaults a day on parking attendants in London alone. It's quite scary walking around giving tickets as people can be quite abusive.  I was lucky and didn't have anything serious happen to me, but some of my colleagues had what are known as ""code reds"", which is a threat of serious assault.  Right from the classroom, the importance of PAs bringing in high numbers of tickets was stressed. For the new trainees to pass probation, their ticket issuing levels had to be at 1.65 per hour, which is about 10 every day.  I never reached that level and so failed my probation and got a verbal warning. Within the base there were ""leader boards"" which listed all the tickets that each PA was getting.  We were divided into teams so if you were bringing back few tickets, like me, you were made to feel bad for letting the team down. Each ticket was £100, so a lot of money is being made by people parking illegally.  Within days of starting, other PAs were telling me how to up my ticket quota by issuing tickets to abandoned vehicles and by breaking the rules. For most offences in Kensington and Chelsea, an illegally parked vehicle has five minutes from the start of the ticketing process to move, or to park properly.  If a motorist arrives at their vehicle within the five minutes they can drive away without incurring any fine. I witnessed one particular PA break this rule on three occasions by making people wait for their tickets to print.  What's worse is this PA was promoted and given a pay rise for bringing back so many tickets.  He was talking about this very openly back at the base and asking advice from other PAs. I was told two other PAs had also taken abandoned bikes and that he personally had been waiting for 10 months to find the right bike. He then asked a removal truck driver to help him move the bike to his house but the owner had recovered it first.  Over in Westminster, my BBC colleague who was posing as a minicab driver heard rumours about parking attendants who were willing to write off motorists' parking tickets for cash.  He made contact with one PA working for NCP who accepted cash (half the price of the fine) to cancel parking fines.  This PA could clear fines from any borough and cleared five parking tickets and one clamp for the driver, all for cash. The driver asked 12 PAs from different boroughs if they could do this and three said yes.  The number of parking tickets issued has increased every year since illegal parking was decriminalised in 1991.  In my experience parking attendants are being pushed to ticket any minor infringement because of the pressure to meet quotas.     In response to the allegations, APCOA's managing director, Paul Bird, said: ""We are deeply concerned about the allegations you've made, we are a very responsible company. We take our duties very seriously. We have many 100s of PAs who are excellent, hardworking, honest individuals and it leads me to believe that the incidents you have captured on footage are very largely isolated incidents.""  The vast majority of tickets are issued accurately, he added, but there would be an investigation.  In a statement, NCP said: ""Any allegations of fraud against an employee will always be fully investigated by a dedicated in-house team. If the allegations were substantiated the employee would be dismissed and the matter referred to the police.""  Whistleblower is on Wednesday 1 June, at 2100BST on BBC One.  Add your comments to this story using the form below:  What I want to know is how he couldn't manage to issue 10 tickets in a day in London! Was he walking around with his eyes closed?!  Ben, England  A few weeks ago my husband and I stopped outside an hotel for which we had a reservation. My husband went into the hotel to enquire about parking whilst I sat in the drivers seat and kept the engine running. Immediately I was surrounded by three PA and then a clamping truck turned up. I explained the situation and was told to make it 'snappy'. My husband immediately returned and had to drop our luggage whilst they milled around. We felt very intimidated by the whole experience although we had taken only a few minutes in total.  Janet Godridge, UK  Parking Attendants are there to provide a service to keep roads clear of e.g. illegally parked cars, they should not have a pre-conceived idea as to the number of tickets they need to issue. Do surgeons have to operate on a certain number of patients before they are paid? If so, I will keep keeping a wide berth when walking past the local hospital.  Juan-Carlos Rodriguez,  Why is there any surprise or shock in this? It stands to reason that if you contract out this kind of service you are going to encourage abuse of it. PAs mostly work for private companies now and they have the power to go out and print money. Companies are run for profit, which means they want as much money as they can get their hands on. It's not rocket science, people.  Chris Jones, UK  It's scandalous if the PAs are really this dishonest. Of course, it's also scandalous if the Whistleblower producers are focusing on isolated incidents and thereby casting a shadow across all PAs. Who can tell for sure ? We can't judge based on these tiny snapshots.  Tony Brooks, Cambridge, UK  The problem with setting targets in any business (public or private) is that it becomes open to abuse to meet those target week in and week out. With the threat of losing your job for not meeting targets, how many people would not bent the rules?  Allan Jones, Hampshire  If drivers were provided with proper parking facilities in town and city centres to start with we would not need parking attendants to start with.  Wayne Pfeiffer, England  It's a shame this happens. A lot of people don't know the 5 min wait before a ticket is issued. There SHOULD be a web site with all this information for the public to be more informed. I agree parking fines should be paid if you are illegally parked but abuse of this by PA who represent a council, who serve the good public, is worse.   Antony Parsons, UK  In our town the parking scheme costs £1 million a year to run but only takes half a million in parking tickets, so the other half million has to be met by issuing fines and my expanding the parking zone year by year - this is done by manipulating the parking issues at the edge of the zone to create a demand for the zone.  Rod, UK  When did a Traffic Warden become a Parking Attendant - do they park my car for me? These private parking companies are a law unto themselves - the public has no way to defend itself against their trigger-happy employees because their bosses have no real governing body - as a result they rob us blind.

587,"He is credited with the famous ""Labour isn't working"" posters of that campaign and 1997's ""New Labour, New Danger"".  Many see his appointment as new joint party chairman as proof of the importance Michael Howard puts on getting his message across to voters.  Now Lord Saatchi, he is also known for his demands for simpler tax laws.  Lord Saatchi, 57, made a name for himself with the advertising agency he founded in the early 1970s with his brother, the renowned art collector, Charles.  He was chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi and under his stewardship the firm became the world's biggest advertising agency.  It became indelibly linked with the excesses of the 1980s boom and launched an audacious bid to take over one of Britain's biggest banks, the Midland.  A shareholder revolt brought a swift end to his role at the firm in 1994.  But it was not the end of the brothers' advertising careers and their new agency, M&C Saatchi, was set up soon afterwards.  The success of both companies has seen the brothers firmly establish themselves among the most colourful characters in the advertising world.  Maurice Saatchi became a Lord in 1996 and is considered a long-term ally of Michael Howard.  Their partnership is said to have strengthened during Mr Howard's time as shadow chancellor while the Tories were led by Iain Duncan Smith.  He became a shadow Treasury spokesman in the House of Lords and has persistently campaigned for the simplification of the tax system.  Two years ago he argued that eight million of Britain's poorest people should stop paying income tax altogether.  Mr Howard has already said that he would like a Tory government to cut taxes and it is expected that Lord Saatchi would help him flesh out the plans.  Lord Saatchi's private interests are less well known than those of his brother, whose wide-ranging modern art collection attracts worldwide attention.  But Maurice is considered a music lover, who also has a taste for the arts himself.  He recently paid £18,400 for a 10ft 6in high statue of Lenin as a young man, which had stood outside a Czech court until the fall of communism.  Lord Saatchi is married to the novelist Josephine Hart."
588,"Former Formula 1 driver Andrea De Cesaris has died at the age of 55.  The Italian was killed in a motorbike accident in Rome, the official F1 website confirmed.  He started 208 races in his Formula 1 career between 1980 and 1994, but never won a Grand Prix, a record for the most races without a win.  He drove for McLaren for one season in 1981 and also raced for teams including Jordan, Brabham, Dallara and Alfa Romeo.  McLaren tweeted: ""All at McLaren send condolences to ex-McLaren #F1 driver Andrea De Cesaris, who sadly passed away today.""  De Cesaris won world championship points for nine of the 10 teams he raced for and finished on the podium five times.  In 1982, aged 22, he became the youngest driver to start a Grand Prix from the front of the grid after he took his sole career pole, with Alfa Romeo, at the US West round.  Following his F1 career, he raced in the Grand Prix Masters series for two seasons in 2005 and 2006 alongside veterans including Nigel Mansell, Emerson Fittipaldi and Ricardo Patrese."
589,"Durham have been relegated from Division One of the County Championship over financial issues, with Hampshire being reinstated.  The North East county have also lost the right to stage Test cricket at their Riverside ground.  Durham have accepted a £3.8m financial aid package, which has been approved by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).  They will start next season in Division Two with a 48-point deduction.  Durham will also face a four-point penalty in the 2017 T20 Blast and a two-point deduction in the One-Day Cup.  Additionally, the club will be subject to a revised salary cap from April 2017-2020, with the level determined annually by the ECB board.  All prize money from ECB competitions, except for player awards, will be withheld until the club's debt to the national governing body is cleared.  The steep penalty has been accepted by the club after they accepted help from the ECB in managing current and historic debts.  ""The financial package and associated conditions approved by the ECB board reflect the unprecedented seriousness of Durham County Cricket Club's financial situation,"" said ECB chief executive Tom Harrison.  ""To help them through these difficulties and continue as a first-class county, this had to be addressed with immediate, practical financial assistance.""  In August, chief executive David Harker called a meeting of the players to reassure them that the club was not going bust and all contracts would be honoured following rumours about their financial situation.  Talks followed, however, with the ECB, who said they wanted ""to ensure a successful and sustainable future"" for the club.  All-rounder Scott Borthwick and opening batsman Mark Stoneman are both moving to Surrey for 2017, which will alleviate some of the salary pressure on the club.  And the unprecedented bailout will allow Durham to continue to pay their players' salaries, meet the costs owed to Revenue and Customs and operating bills and settle ""a substantial debt to a secured creditor"", who has not been named.  David Harker, DCCC Group chief executive said: ""We are clearly disappointed at the position we are in and the sanctions we have accepted, particularly for the players and staff who have worked so hard to keep us in the First Division.  ""It is important that the club addresses its serious financial challenges and puts the business on a sustainable footing and therefore we have had to accept the conditions offered by ECB.  ""Other counties have faced serious financial challenges but have been able to find other solutions including private investors without this reliance on ECB.""  The Professional Cricketers' Association, meanwhile, is to meet the Durham players to discuss the situation.  ""I have emailed all Durham players today to assure them that they can call myself or other PCA staff should they need advice or support during this uncertain period,"" said chief executive David Leatherdale.  Durham captain Paul Collingwood, who came through the academy ranks at Chester-le-Street, said on Twitter that he was angry his side had been relegated.  The 40-year-old former England all-rounder signed a one-year contract extension in July through to the end of 2017 to commit to his 22nd summer of county cricket with the club.  ""Yes I'm angry, yes I'm devastated along with all the other players at this great club but far better being in Division 2 than none at all,"" Collingwood tweeted.  Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove said he felt sympathetic towards Durham's plight although happy at his club's reprieve.  ""It's been a very difficult time in county cricket, especially if you have one of these big grounds to maintain,"" Bransgrove told BBC Radio Solent.  ""We had some tough times in 2011, 2012 and we understand exactly what they've been living with for a long period of time.  ""It's very mixed emotions, but I'm obviously pleased now that it's sunk in, because I do feel that in many respects we deserved another go.  ""We had extraordinary injury problems during this summer so we didn't really have a chance to show ourselves as we really can be.""  Division Two runners-up Kent had previously argued they should be promoted instead of Hampshire retaining their top-flight place.  ""We were not asked to make a formal representation by the ECB as the case was solely concerning Durham's debts etc,"" a club spokesperson told BBC Radio Kent.  ""We're disappointed that the special circumstances of one up, two down being introduced weeks before the season were not considered.""  ""Durham's is a sad and salutary tale. Ambition and enviable cricketing infrastructure, that produced eight Test players, but also over-ambition in that the county had its head turned by the foolish central policy of encouraging all to stage Test cricket.  ""By overextending financially to fulfil their dream, this was the undoing of Durham, who have now lost the right to host Tests.  ""The rescue package comes to £3.8m and they will resume in the second division, having won the County Championship three times in six years.  ""While this has been a lesson to other counties similarly tempted to enter the big time, it should also discourage the ECB from encouraging counties to take such a gamble.""  Durham are the youngest first-class county, having entered the County Championship for the first time in 1992.  Former England all-rounder Ian Botham played for the club in their inaugural season and part of the next, and Dean Jones, David Boon and Shivnarine Chanderpaul are among the overseas players to have appeared at the Riverside.  Chester-le-Street first hosted international cricket in 1999, when Scotland played Pakistan in a one-day international and in all, six Tests, 16 one-dayers and three T20 internationals have been staged at the ground.  Durham had to wait until 2007 to win their first trophy, but then won the Championship three times between 2008 and 2013, before lifting the One-Day Cup in 2014."
590,"   The next time you install software on your computer at work, you could be facing criminal charges. The next time you install software on your computer at work, you could be facing criminal charges. This is what happened to computer technician David McOwen, when he installed a program on the PCs at DeKalb Technical College in Atlanta, Georgia, US, without first asking permission. Mr McOwen loaded a distributed-computing program, similar to the Seti@home screensaver, on the college's PCs so that spare computing capacity could help in a volunteer code-breaking challenge. For his actions, he was charged with computer theft and computer trespass, facing a fine of up to $415,000 and anything from eight to 120 years in jail. Throughout the case, Mr McOwen maintained he did nothing wrong. ""There's a very large difference between people who go out and do crimes on purpose versus someone who is innocent and has good intentions and you get attacked under the law,"" he told the BBC's Go Digital programme. ""They said it was one of the worst things the state had ever seen in regards to computers and crime."" But the case never went to court as earlier this month Mr McOwen accepted a plea agreement to end his two-year legal nightmare. Under the terms of the deal, he walked away with probation, a small fine and community service. The story began in 1999, when David McOwen worked on the computer systems at DeKalb Technical College in Georgia.    This has been proven as a technology for the betterment of mankind on a worldwide scale    He realised that most of the machines on campus sat idle most of the time, with good computing power going to waste. So he installed a program from distributed.net on the PCs. ""If it is in screensaver mode, the computer is just sitting there, wasting electricity, whereas it could be being used to help mankind in a small way,"" he said. Georgia state prosecutors had initially sought more than $415,000 in restitution for bandwidth charges, calculated at 59 cents per second based on the number of machines and amount of time involved. ""It's not an abuse of PCs,"" argued Mr McOwen. ""This has been proven as a technology for the betterment of mankind on a worldwide scale."" Hundreds of thousands of people run distributed computing clients at private companies, universities and their homes. The most famous one is the Seti@Home screensaver programme. Distributed computing works by chopping up large computer jobs into small portions, and sending these bits of work to individual PCs over the internet. The case has sent shivers through the distributed computing community, with many concerned that it has set a legal precedent. Last year, the Tennessee Valley Authority sacked 18 employees for running Seti@Home on their computers. They were threatened with criminal charges, but that never came about. Mr McOwen sees the end result as a victory. ""This is really a defeat for the statute, not a win, because it shows the statute needs fine tuning."" The case has taken a heavy personal toll on the system administrator. He resigned from his job at DeKalb soon after the school threatened him and last August he was fired from his next job because of the bad publicity surrounding the case. He has been jobless for several months and has been surviving on his wife's salary and help from his father."
591,"Kevin Brennan was an Oxford contemporary of William Hague, indeed he succeeded him as President of the Union, but their subsequent careers have gone down very different paths.  Brennan entered the crucible of Welsh Labour politics, becoming chairman of Cardiff Council's economic scrutiny committee.  He also became the right hand man of his predecessor as Cardiff West's MP, Rhodri Morgan.  When loyalties were tested with the initial contest between Alun Michael and Rhodri Morgan, Brennan sided with Morgan rather than the leadership's choice.  On the left of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Brennan has also said that he ""would have found it difficult to vote for a cut in lone parents' benefits.""  Mr Brennan was instrumental in extracting the government's commitment to establish a £400million fund to provide compensation for workers who lost pensions when their firms went bankrupt.  Along with the ISTC union, Mr Brennan had been lobbying the government to provide for such protection since the collapse of Allied Steel and Wire in 2002 when hundreds of steelworkers in Cardiff lost both their jobs and their pensions.  Prior to this, his most high-profile intervention was when he appeared in the Commons chamber without a tie in order to call for a less formal dress code for MPs.  He is currently a member of the Public Administration Select Committee and the Northern Ireland Grand Committee."
592,"Jim Atchison, the chief executive of SeaWorld, has resigned.  The aquatic amusement park has struggled to attract visitors in the wake of a 2013 film, Blackfish, which criticised its treatment of killer whales.  SeaWorld acknowledged in August that the film had hurt revenues at its San Diego, California park.  The company's share price has fallen 44% this year, and now trades around $16 per share.  In a statement, SeaWorld said that current board chairman David F D'Alessandro would serve as interim chief executive, and that the firm would also continue with its plans to reorganise in order to save $50m by the end of 2015.  The company said that part of the restructuring would involve job cuts.  In its most recent earnings report, it said attendance had dropped to 8.4 million visitors in the third-quarter of 2014 from 8.9 million in the same period a year earlier.  It attributed the decline to ""a combination of factors including negative media attention in California along with a challenging competitive environment."""
593,"BMI has 17% of the landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport, but limited access to the lucrative transatlantic route, whereas Virgin has the transatlantic rights but only 3% of Heathrow's slots.  But despite the possible benefits, which the BBC's correspondent says could result in a deal being signed by late this year, both are playing down the talks.  ""There have been no definitive conclusions reached on the potential opportunities, nor any other form of more permanent tie-up between the two companies, such as the acquisition of BMI by Virgin,"" a statement from the airline said.  BMI is controlled by its founder and chairman Sir Michael Bishop. Lufthansa and the Scandinavian airline SAS hold 49% of the business.  Virgin is thought to be eager to take over BMI's European routes into Heathrow because these could feed into its long-haul flights to the US, the Caribbean, the Far East, India and Africa.  ""BMI and Virgin have for some time been exploring possible areas for greater co-operation in expanding their respective businesses, including code sharing expansion, potential sharing of facilities and joint lobbying on matters of common interest,"" Virgin said.  A BMI spokesman said the airlines were not currently talking about a tie-up.  ""Although the two companies talk regularly about a range of issues and have explored and continue to explore various forms of co-operation there are no ongoing discussions in relation to a merger.""  Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group owns 51% of Virgin Atlantic and the remaining stake is owned by Singapore Airlines."
594,"The final Grenfell Tower fire toll will not be known until at least the end of the year, with 80 people currently presumed dead, police have said.  Most of those who died in the 14 June blaze were said to be in 23 of the North Kensington building's 129 flats.  Police are tracing victims via ""every imaginable source"" of information; from government agencies to fast food firms.  The opening of inquests into seven of the victims heard a six-month-old baby was found dead in her mother's arms.  Survivors and relatives of those who died have expressed frustration at the progress of the investigation.  But Det Supt Fiona McCormack said the full death toll would only be known when the search and recovery operation and identification process was over.  ""What I can say is that we believe that around 80 people are either dead or sadly missing and I must presume that they are dead,"" the officer said.  She added: ""I don't want there to be any hidden victims. We want to understand the true human cost of this tragedy.""  The previously given death toll from the fire was 79.  The Metropolitan Police announcement came as Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs that cladding from 120 high-rise buildings in 37 local authority areas in England has now failed fire safety tests.  Mrs May rejected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's claim that the fire was the result of fewer building control inspectors and ""the disastrous effect of austerity"", saying the cladding of tower blocks was an issue that had ""developed over decades"" under successive governments and councils.  In the update to the investigation, police said:  Police said ""it would have been impossible for anyone to produce a list before that showed exactly who was in Grenfell Tower that night - that includes those people living there but also those visiting"".  ""What I can tell you is there are 129 flats inside Grenfell Tower. We, the police, have spoken to at least one occupant of 106 of those 129 flats,"" Det Supt McCormack said.  ""These people have been able to tell us not just who lived in those flats, but importantly who was in those flats on the night.""  The officer said 18 people connected to those 106 flats are dead or missing presumed dead but ""it is a terrible reality that there are 23 flats where despite huge investigative efforts, we have been unable to trace anyone alive who lived there.  ""At this stage, we must presume, that no-one in those 23 flats survived, that includes anyone who lived there or was visiting them.""  Det Supt McCormack said officers were having to prepare some families for the reality that their relatives' remains may never be recovered.  Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox opened and adjourned more inquests into the deaths of victims, including baby Leena Belkadi and her sister Malak, aged eight.  Leena, who died from inhalation of fire fumes, was found with her mother in a stairwell between the 19th and 20th floor. The inquests into the deaths of the girl's parents - Farah Hamdan and Omar Belkadi - were opened earlier.  The other inquests to opened included that of Syrian refugee Mohammed Al Haj Ali, 23, who was the first fatality to be formally identified by police. He had been previously named as Mohammad Alhajali.  Local people have created their own databases on missing people with figures which differ from those officially released.  Police say they hoped information would be sent to its investigation if it might help to identify the missing.  Meanwhile, a number of Grenfell Tower residents confronted housing minister Alok Sharma MP on why the homeless are not yet rehoused, in tense exchanges on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.  Many said they had not been able to sleep since the disaster, or were haunted by images of their escape and their friends, family and neighbours who perished.  The fire destroyed 151 homes, most in the tower block, but also a number of surrounding properties. Mr Sharma said the government guaranteed people who had had their homes destroyed would be offered suitable temporary accommodation within three weeks.  But Mahad Egal, who escaped the fourth floor of Grenfell Tower, told the programme he refused the offer of alternative accommodation in a high rise block for his family.  Oluwaseun Talabi, said he had lost everything and was living with his wife and young daughter in a hotel room.  ""I am not going to take any house you give me, it has to be suitable,"" he said.

595,"The last surviving player from the first World Cup final, Francisco Varallo, has died in Argentina at the age of 100 .  Varallo played in the final between Uruguay and Argentina in Uruguay capital Montevideo in 1930.  His team lost the match 4-2 to Uruguay.  Mr Varallo scored 194 goals for his club Boca Juniors, a team record that was only broken this year by the current striker, Martin Palermo.  His nickname was ""Canoncito"" (little canon) for his powerful shot.  In an interview with Fifa to mark his 100th birthday this year, Varallo said the loss to Uruguay in 1930 was his greatest disappointment.  ""With all due respect for my teammates, we weren't gutsy enough,"" the former footballer said.  ""How I cried that day. Even now when I look back it still makes me angry.""  Varallo retired as a player due to injury at the age of 30 to work as a coach with Boca's lower division teams and with the club Gimnasia."
596,"Why TV is the key to Real success  Why do Real Madrid and Barcelona have higher revenues than any English club? The answer lies in the way they sell television rights to their domestic fixtures. Ronaldo's club earn an average of 150m euros a year from TV rights The Spanish system allows them to negotiate their own broadcasting deals. In many other countries the TV deals are negotiated by the league they play in, and the money is distributed according to an agreed formula. As winners of the English Premier League, Manchester United received £52m from the distribution of TV rights in 2008/9. Real Madrid - second in La Liga - earned more than double that amount from its broadcasting contract with Mediapro. According to the sports unit at consultants Deloitte, both Real Madrid and Barcelona have deals with Mediapro until at least 2012/13 which will contribute broadcasting revenues of, on average, approximately 150m euros ($203m; £136m) each year. In England the distribution of TV money is unequal. But it is a lot less unequal than in Spain. The Business of Sport - Football in the Red. It will be broadcast live on Tuesday 2 March (all times GMT) For example, Manchester City, who came tenth in the 2008/9 season received £40m - only £12m less than winners United. And this way of distributing money has helped seven English clubs into Deloitte's list of the 20 highest-earning clubs in the world. Spain has the top two, but no other Spanish club makes the top 20. The attraction of more equal distribution is that it should help produce a more competitive domestic league. So far this season, both Real Madrid and Barcelona have won 19 out of 23 games in La Liga. In England, Chelsea and Manchester United have both won 19 out of 28. So watching an English Premier League game has offered viewers a better chance of watching something other than the routine destruction of less well resourced clubs. With international TV rights becoming an increasingly important source of income and leagues competing for attention around the world, the Spanish model has clear dangers. In the long run, re-distribution of revenues to help the less well supported clubs should produce a more competitive and watchable league. The merits of a more re-distributive system are about to be put to the test. In Italy the clubs are about to move from a system where clubs sell TV rights individually to a more collective arrangement. As the Deloitte Sports Unit warns in its annual report on football finance, that may pose problems for clubs like Juventus. Its 28,000-seat stadium is a third of the size of some of the other big European clubs. And with that limit on ticket sales, Juve gets almost two thirds of its total revenue from its lucrative domestic television deal. A more even distribution of Italian TV revenues is an obvious threat. But the argument is that making collective arrangements will increase total revenues and make Serie A into a stronger league. As most football fans now know, it is the business arrangements behind the scenes which often drive what happens on the field. And very often, TV is the key.     "
597,"Police have condemned ""sustained, determined and mindless"" violence which marred the end of the Leeds music festival early on Monday morning.  Several hundred festival-goers went on the rampage after the event at Temple Newsam finished, burning two toilet blocks to the ground and attacking police with missiles.  Skips were set alight and electric cables were pulled down, and 200 officers - many in riot gear - were deployed to stop the trouble.  Over 50,000 people attended the three-day event, which otherwise passed off peacefully.  Inspector Nick Dyson of West Yorkshire Police said one male officer suffered a broken nose, while two vehicles were damaged.  ""Police said the violence, which is believed to have involved several hundred people, was determined and sustained and condemned it as mindless,"" he added.  The Leeds event ran in conjunction with the long-running Reading festival, with bands such as Pulp, The Strokes, Ash and Foo Fighters playing both venues on alternate days.  But the Leeds site - which also featured a set from Guns 'N' Roses on Friday - was only confirmed last month after councillors originally refused a licence application after complaints about violence at last year's festival.  Now local campaigners are vowing to oppose next year's event.  But Melvin Benn, of festival organiser Mean Fiddler, said it would be showing ""a lack of Yorkshire grit"" if the festival was cancelled.  The Leeds festival was also marred by the death of a 19-year-old man, found in his tent by friends.  Police said the man - who is believed to have had a history of congenital heart problems - had been drinking during the night, and they were not treating the death as suspicious.  Festivalgoers had previously been entertained by a varied bill including Ash, who played despite the suspected cracked ribs suffered by drummer Rick McMurray in their recent bus crash in America.  Also playing on Sunday were the Foo Fighters, Muse, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Hives.  By contrast, Thames Valley police said the Reading festival ended in a ""good-natured"" way - with the worst offences being a few drunken brawls.  Most of the crimes reported at the music extravaganza were thefts - anything from sleeping bags to mobile phones - mostly from tents."
598,"A senior British diplomat has been shot dead in his car in the Greek capital, Athens. Military attache Brigadier Stephen Saunders was rushed to a local hospital in a serious condition, but died later of his injuries. Greek police are now virtually certain the killing, by two gunmen on a motorcycle, was carried out by left-wing guerilla group November 17. Ballistic tests revealed that the gun used had been used by the group in past attacks. November 17 has killed 23 people, including Brigadier Saunders, since it first appeared in 1975. None of its members have been caught. British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the killing as an act of terrorism which was contemptible as well as senseless.    The act is not only condemned by the Greek Government but by all the Greek people    ""[Brigadier Saunders] was a consummate professional who had served his country with distinction both at home and overseas. ""His murder is a reminder of the risks that British military personnel face in many places around the world,"" he added. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he was ""shocked"" by the shooting. ""I am in touch with the Greek authorities and am offering them our full co-operation in making sure that whoever perpetrated this brutal attack is brought to justice,"" he said. The two gunmen opened fire on Brigadier Saunders around 0800 (0500 GMT) as the British official drove a white Rover belonging to the embassy along Kifissias avenue in a northern suburb. It appears that the car the Brigadier was driving was not bullet proofed. Brigadier Saunders, 53, who was married with two children, suffered four gunshot wounds to the abdomen, the hospital said. The gunmen fled and there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Roots in resistance to former junta ""The method used, the weapon used, lead us to believe that the assailants belong to November 17, that is the direction we are looking in,"" said Dimitris Efsthathiadis, a senior official in the Ministry for Public Order. Police said they found four spent cartridges at the scene from a .45-calibre pistol, the weapon used by the November 17 group in about 20 assassinations attributed to the group since 1975. 1986: Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, serving in N.Ireland, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Kuwait 1999: Promoted to Brigadier and appointed defence attache to the British Embassy in Athens The November 17 group targets western officials and economic targets. Its first victim, in 1975, was the CIA station chief in Athens. None of its members has ever been arrested and convicted. The US State Department has recently criticised the Greek authorities for failing to stop terrorist attacks. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou has condemned the attack and pledged that his government would combat terrorism relentlessly. ""I want to condemn this terrorist act. The act is not only condemned by the Greek government but by all the Greek people,"" he said."
599,"France's intervention in Mali is driven by the fear of a future threat. But will it increase the danger for Paris in the short term?  ""France has attacked Islam. We will strike at the heart of France,"" said Abou Dardar, a leader of the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao), an offshoot of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).  French President Francois Hollande has also said that ""all necessary precautions"" would be adopted.  The threat level has been raised a notch, leading to increased surveillance over public buildings, transport infrastructure as well as some embassies and religious institutions.  AQIM is the group that worries the authorities most, but the view amongst most experts is that it does not currently have the capacity and networks on the ground to carry out a serious attack within France in the short term.  However, analysts caution that the group may now increase its efforts to build that capacity.  The group has also put out appeals to like-minded supporters to act - essentially a call for anyone to do what they can independently.  The more immediate worry for France may be retaliation closer to Mali - there are 6,000 citizens in Mali itself but embassies, businesses and private citizens may all be at risk across North Africa.  France has updated its travel advice to citizens in Mali specifically but not ordered a general evacuation.  In the past, US officials have talked of AQIM paying ""lip service"" to exporting terrorism but said that they were not yet convinced the danger had become real beyond the region.  This intervention could have the effect of galvanising the desire of the groups to strike in Europe.  AQIM's membership in the Sahel region is reckoned to number several hundred but has been growing recently.  Those heading to Islamist-controlled areas of Mali include Algerians, Nigerians and West Africans.  There have also been reports of some jihadists coming from Europe - including France - although US intelligence officials late last year said they could not confirm their presence.  The threat posed by the groups was transformed by the influx of weapons from Libya trafficked over the border on the same routes used for drugs smuggling.  The greatest fear remains the acquisition of surface-to-air missiles.  Only about a quarter of the SA7s accounted for before the conflict in Libya could be accounted for afterwards, and officials believe it is ""almost inevitable"" that some are in Mali, although the extent to which they can be deployed is unclear.  In the past experts argued that AQIM looked as much like a criminal network as a militant group.  However, with the shift of its centre of gravity from Algeria to northern Mali, it acquired a sanctuary which began to change its character. More charismatic leaders are also thought to have congregated there.  The fear was always that the longer the group became entrenched, the more likely it would be to try and reach into Europe to carry out attacks.  Last year, Boko Haram in Nigeria emerged as one of the most prolific militant groups, carrying out a large number of low-level attacks but also some more sophisticated attacks.  The concern is that these have come as a result of input from AQIM.  Intelligence officials say they have seen the transfer of funds and shared training, including in explosives and suicide bombers.  European intelligence officials say last year they saw evidence that some jihadists from Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen were looking to move on because of pressure from drone strikes and other interventions, and that Mali (along with Syria) was a top destination.  AQIM has focused on kidnap for ransom as a means of raising funds and those most vulnerable to retaliation are the eight French hostages currently being held by Islamist groups across the region by different groups.  Two men were abducted in Mali itself by AQIM in November 2011.  In January of that year an attempt to rescue two other hostages resulted in their deaths.  The failed French raid at the weekend to try and free a hostage in Somalia held by al-Shabab reflects the danger that those individuals may be in.  Al-Shabab has been weakened in recent months, but one concern expressed by US officials is that as the group loses ground in certain areas, it will turn further to terrorist tactics and work even harder to export violence beyond Kenya and Uganda, perhaps even to Europe.  French officials say there was no link between the raid to free the hostage in Mali, as the rescue mission had been in the planning for many weeks while in Mali events moved fast in recent days.  But the failure of that mission illustrates how hard it may be to resolve some of the hostage situations.  The French foreign minister has met the families of many of the hostages to keep them up-to-date.  Paris has clearly decided that the short-term risk of increased threat from intervening is outweighed by the importance of denying a militant group a long-term sanctuary.  No-one in Paris - or any other Western capital - wants parts of Mali to become like Afghanistan in the 1990s - a place where acts of terror further afield could be planned and where people would then ask why something was not done earlier."
600,"Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant will build a new generation of Astra cars in an ""historic"" deal that will see it produce at least 160,000 cars a year.  About 700 jobs will be created at the plant, which employs 2,100, plus thousands more in the supply chain.  Owner General Motors announced it will invest £125m in the factory and spend about £1bn in the UK component sector.  It was feared that Ellesmere Port could shut under a GM restructuring plan that may still see a European plant close.  Vauxhall chairman Duncan Aldred said it was a ""ground-breaking, historic day"" for Ellesmere Port and the UK motor industry.  General Motors' investment in the UK motor industry - seemingly at the expense of rival plants in mainland Europe - bursts a few myths. Are not UK unions supposed to be inflexible to new labour agreements? Don't multinationals prefer to shut plants in the UK rather than mainland Europe because it is easier? And hasn't the country given up on manufacturing? There has been a bit of hyperbole around the Ellesmere Port news, but that is probably due to relief. For so long it seemed that the plant would close and 2,100 jobs go. Lost in the latest news about Vauxhall is another nugget of optimism. The number of cars built in the UK last month was almost 10% up on a year ago, boosted by strong export demand. Clearly, the wheels haven't come off UK manufacturing just yet.  Production of the new Astra will begin at the Cheshire plant in 2015 and run until at least 2020. After the investment, Ellesmere Port will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 cars annually.  Mr Aldred said Vauxhall would more than double the UK component content in the cars, spending £1bn with contractors, which he claimed would create 3,000 jobs in the supply chain.  As part of an agreement to invest in the factory, Vauxhall workers voted by 94% in favour of a new four-year pay and conditions deal that would enable the plant to work around the clock for 51 weeks of the year if necessary.  Mr Aldred described the flexibility of this deal as ""ground-breaking"".  He said: ""This is great news for the Ellesmere Port plant, our employees, the local community, our suppliers, the Vauxhall brand and the UK. We have been able to develop a responsible labour agreement that secures the plant's future.  ""This is assisted by the Government's industrial strategy, increasing its focus on the manufacturing sector and creating ideal ground for companies to build up long-term investments.""  Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, told the BBC that no financial inducements were offered to GM.  Mr Cable described the Astra news as ""a good story"" and said it underlined that the UK ""is a good business environment for the motor industry"".  He added: ""They [GM] wanted an assurance that the government was behind the industry, which we are. The car industry in the UK is a great success story.  ""This is a success for team working. We have had business, unions and government working together in a very productive partnership.""  The Unite union's general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""From a position of uncertainty earlier this year, there is now a potential for a future at the plant until 2020 and beyond.  ""Importantly this move will also bring component supplier plants back into the UK, a development that strengthens our manufacturing base generally.""  However, he said he recognised that Ellesmere Port's good news could spell bad news for other GM operations in Europe.  Vauxhall is the UK arm of Opel, GM's European unit. Since 1999, Opel has lost $11bn (£7bn), almost a quarter of it during the last two or three years.  Last year, Opel lost $750m and today's announcement about Ellesmere Port is expected to be accompanied by separate news that a factory in mainland Europe could be shut.  Analysts say that its carmaking capacity is out of step with demand. The company has been working on a restructuring plan for months.  There are fears in Germany that the Opel factory in Bochum is vulnerable to closure.  Bochum produces 30 cars an hour over three shifts a day. Ellesmere Port produces 47 cars an hour over two shifts a day - a company record.  But Germany could yet benefit from an expected decision to move production of its Chevrolet brand from Asia to Europe.  Ellesmere Port plant was thought to be vulnerable because it has traditionally been politically difficult to close plants in mainland Europe.  Analysts also say it is simply cheaper and easier to let workers go in the UK than elsewhere in Western Europe.  But the willingness of unions and workers at the plant to agree to more flexible working arrangements played an important role in GM's decision, as had the government's engagement on the issue in recent months.  In February, Mr Cable flew to the US and met GM's chief executive Dan Akerson and vice-chairman Steve Girsky.  He made the case for why GM should invest in the UK for the long term. Sources suggest the meeting may have played an important role in the company's ultimate decision to back the UK.  Although the government insists that it has not offered the company any up-front cash, there are several sources of money - including the Regional Growth Fund and the advanced manufacturing supply chain initiative - that the company may be able to access."
601,"It was while performing at the international festival in 1955 with a male choir that the Italian tenor first tasted musical stardom.  The tenor returned to sing at Llangollen 40 years later in 1995.  Opera star Bryn Terfel said of Pavarotti: ""His premiership voice put us all into the second division.""  Terfel said he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of Pavarotti's death, calling him ""a truly inspirational and awe-inspiring artist with a voice of pure gold"".  Llangollen eisteddfod chief executive Gwyn L Williams said Pavarotti's experience in Llangollen half a century ago had inspired him to turn professional.  Pavarotti was training as a school teacher when he travelled to Llangollen aged 19 as a member of the Choral Rossini, a male chorus from Modena in northern Italy.  The choir also included his father, an opera lover and gifted amateur tenor, and when they won first prize, it fired Pavarotti's musical ambitions.  ""He came to Llangollen for the first time as a young lad in 1955 with his father Fernando with a choir from Modena,"" said Mr Williams.  ""The choir had the first prize and Luciano Pavarotti was always referring back to the experience as the most important experience in his life and what inspired him to turn professional.""  ""He once said if he could win the first prize with a small choir from Modena then he could do anything. And that what was his attitude to singing all his life.""  Four decades after his first appearance, Pavarotti - who became an international celebrity when he performed Puccini's Nessun Dorma at the close of the 1990 World Cup - returned to Llangollen.  ""He came back to Llangollen in 1995 to do a concert, a very special occasion and there were thousands there to see him.""  Pavarotti had been suffering from pancreatic cancer for some time and during this year's international eisteddfod in July, Mr Williams contacted Pavarotti's agent to ask her to pass on the message from the festival saying they were thinking of him.  ""This is a very sad day, someone once said that this tenor was one who had the sun in his voice, and they were right, he had a special ring in his voice which you can't mistake for any one else,"" he said.  There had been plans for the Italian tenor to perform at the eisteddfod again during his series of retirement concerts around the world, but the promised appearance never materialised."
602,"The 25-year-old, who will arrive from Brann Bergen in January, told the club's website: ""Wigan is a club in a great position and with great ambition.  ""To play in the Premiership is a dream for me, I am really looking forward to starting with the club.""  Manager Paul Jewell added: ""Paul will be an excellent signing for us. He is very quick, strong n the air and can play anywhere in defence or midfield.""  Scharner has 11 caps for Austria and played against England in the World Cup qualifier at Old Trafford - where he caught Wigan boss Paul Jewell's eye.  Birmingham made a move for Scharner in the autumn after the defender impressed in a friendly against Birmingham but Wigan then tabled a higher bid.  Wigan agreed a fee of around £2m for the centre-back, who could make his debut in the FA Cup match against Leeds on 4 January."
603,"The new TSB bank has been launched with a promise to ""fuel local economies"", but the website hit problems on the first morning.  Lloyds Banking Group said there have been ""intermittent"" website problems across almost all its brands, including the new standalone TSB.  Five million customers are seeing their accounts automatically transferred from Lloyds to TSB.  Customers' bank account numbers and sort codes will remain the same.  TSB's mobile banking will not start until later in the week.  Bank cards will continue to work, with the name of the new bank included as new cards are issued in due course.  Some 631 branches of Lloyds Banking Group, including all of the Cheltenham and Gloucester branches and all Lloyds branches in Scotland, have been switched to the standalone TSB.  The new bank will be sold off next year, as part of a process ordered by the European Commission, to provide greater competition.  The sale was a condition of the government's bail-out of Lloyds, which is 39%-owned by the taxpayer.  Lloyds is currently the UK's dominant personal bank account provider, and will run the TSB as a separate unit until it is sold as a public company in its own right via the issue of shares next year.  TSB's leadership said that the ethos of the bank will mirror the original Trustee Savings Bank with 200 years of history.  ""We bring the new TSB Bank back to over 600 communities across the UK to fuel their local economies - and nothing else,"" said Paul Pester, TSB's chief executive.  ""We have today launched a bank which has been born fully formed.""  The TSB name is reappearing after TSB merged with Lloyds 18 years ago.  As well as the branches, TSB will have four call centres and employ 8,500 staff, making it the eighth largest High Street bank. In a BBC News interview last week, Lloyds Banking Group's chief executive, Antonio Horta-Osorio, promised that the transition for customers will be ""seamless"".  However, a number of customers took to social media to complain about internet banking issues on the first morning.  A TSB spokeswoman said some customers were unable to log on successfully, although the problem should now be resolved. Branches, telephone banking and cash machine facilities were not affected in any way.  Lloyds said the internet banking problems were unrelated to the switchover.  The UK's banking industry is dominated by five big names, which control 83% of retail (personal) bank accounts.  As well as Lloyds, the other banks which lead the field are RBS, Barclays, HSBC and Santander.  They have been variously caught up in a catalogue of scandals, including fixing the key Libor interest rate and mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI).  Later this month, new rules designed to make it easier for people to switch accounts will come into force.  There has been disagreement among commentators over whether the appearance of TSB will boost competition.  Shore Capital's banking analyst Gary Greenwood said: ""TSB will be painted as a new challenger brand on the High Street but I doubt that its pricing is going to be very differentiated to competitors.  ""Current accounts tend to be very sticky and customers only tend to move if they have a really, really bad experience.""  Mark Garnier, a Conservative member of the cross-party parliamentary committee on banks, also voiced doubt: ""TSB is certainly not the answer. We want entrepreneurs to come into the marketplace and start opening banks.""  However, Kevin Mountford, head of banking at price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said: ""The launch of TSB bank can only be good news for consumers as it creates greater competition on the High Street.""  Lloyds had been close to selling the business to the Co-operative Bank. That fell through in April after concerns emerged over the Co-op's financial strength."
604,"A £1bn upgrade of the British army's Warrior armoured vehicles has been announced by the government.  The move was revealed by Prime Minister David Cameron and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond on a visit to defence firm Lockheed Martin UK in Bedford.  It is hoped the move will extend the service life of the military vehicles through to 2040 and beyond.  The MoD has awarded Lockheed Martin UK a £642m contract as part of the project, securing 600 jobs.  Mr Hammond said: ""As a key step towards meeting our requirements for Future Force 2020, the upgraded Warriors will give commanders and their soldiers greater flexibility and firepower.  For the British army this announcement has been a long time coming. The planned upgrade to the ageing Warrior armoured vehicle - which first went into service in the late 1980s - had been put on hold while the Ministry of Defence tried to work out how to pay for it. Recent cuts in defence spending had jeopardised the programme. The work only got the go-ahead when the Treasury agreed this summer to a modest 1% increase in the MoD's defence equipment programme after 2015. That amounts to an extra £3bn - still not enough to cover the British military's long wish-list for new kit. Despite the Warrior upgrade the Army is still hoping to buy a new generation of specialist armoured vehicles - the Scout SV programme. Finding the money for that in this age of austerity will be much harder. The spirit of the times seems to be more ""make do and mend"".  ""Not only is this fantastic news for the Army, it also represents a great boost to British industry - sustaining jobs, skills and capability within the UK's armoured vehicle sector.""  Mr Cameron praised the role the Warrior had already played in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.  The vehicles will be fitted with a new turret and 40mm cannon, which will allow them to fire more accurately while moving.  There will also be a new armour mounting system, allowing more flexibility with different types of armour.  The head of the Army, Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall, who was also on the visit, said: ""This announcement of an upgrade to one of the Army's most important fighting vehicles is extremely welcome.  ""Warrior will continue to be at the heart of our combat capability for at least another 25 years with state-of-the-art firepower and electronics.  ""Wherever the Army deploys, our infantry will depend on its superior protection, mobility and lethality. This will be a battle winner.""  Lockheed Martin UK vice-president Alan McCormick said the decision would bring ""significant job opportunities"" for its UK suppliers.  Earlier this year, the then Defence Secretary Liam Fox told MPs the Treasury had agreed that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) could plan on the equipment and equipment support budget being increased by 1% a year in real terms between 2015-16 and 2020-21.  Mr Fox said this increase in funding meant the military could go ahead with projects including:"
605,"The Scottish Professional Footballers' Association has announced its Scottish Premier League team of the year. BBC Sport assesses the outstanding contribution each player has made to their club's season in Scottish football's top-flight and what attracted the votes of the managers. Artur Boruc (Celtic): Arsenal and AC Milan are rumoured to be in the hunt to lure the Polish shot-stopper supreme away from Celtic Park after an almost error-free season that has been pivotal to Celtic's success. Steven Whittaker (Hibernian): The 22-year-old marauding right-back was rewarded for his early-season performances when he was called into the senior Scotland squad for the first time for the game against Ukraine in October. Consistently steady in defence he has provided an extra attacking outlet for Hibs in their run to CIS Cup victory and the Scottish Cup semi-finals. Russell Anderson (Aberdeen): He has been the rock on which Aberdeen have built their, until recent lapses, sustained challenge to Rangers for the second Champions League spot - but a Uefa Cup place is almost sealed. The Dons captain must count himself unfortunate not to have featured more for Scotland in the Euro 2008 qualifiers given his obdurate consistency. Stephen McManus (Celtic): The imposing 24-year-old centre-back has embodied Celtic's never-say-die spirit all season and looks a prime candidate to inherit the club captaincy if/when Neil Lennon departs. Made the step up to full international level with Scotland and looks the part on the bigger stage. Lee Naylor (Celtic): Treated with some suspicion by the Celtic faithful before his £600,000 switch from Wolves, the talented left-back has proved to be one of the best value buys in recent seasons - solid in the tackle, quick, with good awareness and useful going forward to deliver whipped crosses into the box. Celtic fans certainly know who the young Englishman is now. Scott Brown (Hibernian): His skillful, energetic running has been a prominent feature all season, and, when he's on song, Hibs are usually at their fluent best. Would be a huge loss if, as rumoured, he heads west to Ibrox in the summer. Made an impressive debut for Scotland against Georgia and will be an integral part of Alex McLeish's future national squads. Barry Ferguson (Rangers): It would be a shame if the Rangers captain's season is remembered more for his influence off the pitch than on, following his part in Paul Le Guen's downfall. Ferguson has been back to his strutting, box-to-box best for club and country. Shunsuke Nakamura (Celtic): Celtic's talismanic deadball specialist and all-round midfield maestro is a well-deserved SPFA player of the year and it was fitting that yet another of his trademark precision free-kicks should seal the title for Celtic at Rugby Park. His spectacular late strike against Manchester United gave Celtic victory and helped them through to the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time ever. Steven Naismith (Kilmarnock): The 20-year-old, recently voted the young player of the year by his peers, has netted 17 times so far to help the Rugby Park club clinch a top-six place in the SPL and has attracted interest from, among others, Arsenal. Always an exciting prospect, Naismith is now blooming into a fully-fledged talent. Kris Boyd (Rangers): It seems almost ludicrous that, despite another free-scoring season, the enigmatic striker still attracts criticism for his lack of movement outside the opposition box. With the correct nurturing from Walter Smith and Ally McCoist and an increased application on Boyd's part, he could arguably grow into a more complete frontman - but you can't argue with his astonishing stats of almost a goal a game. Scott McDonald (Motherwell): The diminutive Australian striker has signed a pre-contract agreement at Celtic and, with 14 goals already this season, he has a higher tally than any of Celtic's current strikers. His dynamic energy and impressive strike rate could provide Gordon Strachan with the perfect foil for Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink.     "
606,"A grizzly bear Ursus arctos, spotted from the air in Manitoba, Canada Grizzly bears are being spotted in Manitoba, Canada, where biologists say only polar bears are usually found. Scientists from City University of New York say sightings are increasing. ""Grizzlies would likely hibernate in polar bear maternity denning habitat,"" says CUNY's Linda Gormezano. They would come out of hibernation at the same time and can kill polar cubs,"" warned Ms Gormezano, who has seen the grizzlies from the air. The researchers first spotted a grizzly bear (Ursus arctos ) in August 2008. ""The first time we saw a grizzly we were flying over the middle of Wapusk, counting fox dens,"" explained CUNY's Professor Robert Rockwell, who is also a research fellow at the American Museum of Natural History. Since then they have examined the records and found no evidence of grizzly bears before 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 they found nine confirmed sightings. In the summer of 2009, three more were spotted. The data has been published in Canadian Field-Naturalist. The scientists say that the barren landscape north of the Hudson Bay had been thought to be impassable for migrating grizzlies. But now some have reached Canada's Wapusk National Park to be rewarded with abundant caribou, moose, fish and berries. ""We don't yet know if they are wandering or staying - the proof will come from an observed den or cubs - these animals will eventually be residents of this national park,"" said Professor Rockwell. A wild hybrid between a grizzly and polar bear was shot in Canada ""The Cree elders we talked to feel that now grizzly bears have found this food source, they will be staying. ""A big question is how to deal with these new residents... In Canada, both the polar and grizzly bear are federally listed as species of special concern,"" he added. As grizzly bears move into areas usually populated only by polar bears, hybrids between the two become more likely. Also known as pizzly, prizzly or grolar bears, these have been bred in zoos. Their presence in the wild was confirmed by DNA tests after one was shot in Banks Island, in the Canadian arctic.     "
607,"John Garang was a government army officer sent to quell a mutiny of 500 southern troops who were resisting orders to be shipped north. It took him 22 years to come back. Garang fought for more than 20 years Thus began the story of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which fought one of Africa's longest-running wars between the Christian and animist South and the Muslim, Arab-speaking North. Instead of following his superiors' orders, Mr Garang went on to encourage mutinies in other garrisons and set himself at the head of the rebellion against the Khartoum government. He was one of the few senior southerners who really believed in the concept of a united Sudan    Between 1983 and the peace agreement signed in January 2005, Sudan's civil war took nearly two million lives and left millions more displaced. The war officially ended and John Garang was appointed first vice-president - a position he held for only three weeks before he was killed in a helicopter crash. With his beard, bulky physique, and jet-black skin of his Dinka ethnic group, he came across as one of the most complicated rebels on a continent that has seen every shade of self-proclaimed revolutionaries and liberators. The rebel leader with a PhD in Agricultural Economics from the United States spent his early and middle life in the bush planning to blow up oil wells. Despite his being at the centre of the Sudan conflict for so long, very little was known about Mr Garang the man. A military man who believed in a military solution for his country He was, at best, described as a difficult man caught up in a complicated war. ""Becoming Vice President after 22 years leading a guerrilla army in the bush John Garang was an expert in survival: someone who knew how to bend with the wind yet maintain his political objectives, someone who knew how to seem all things to all men,"" says Peter Moszynski, a Sudan specialist who covered the war for many years. ""Above all he was someone who understood the cardinal rule of political longevity: keep your friends close but your enemies closer... ""He was also one of the few senior southerners who really believed in the concept of a united Sudan and his passing will greatly strengthen the call for secession"" Gill Lusk - deputy editor of Africa Confidential and a Sudan specialist who interviewed the ex-guerrilla leader several times over the years - described Mr Garang as a proud man. ""He's a man with charisma and his leadership qualities are quite obvious,"" Ms Lusk told the BBC News website. ""He's very much a professional military man, a man who believes he's clever. ""He likes grand ideas, and has a great sense of humour - at least among his people."" John Garang was born in 1945 into the southern Dinka group famous for worshipping the sky, playing music on ram's horns and their love of roast meat. His family was Christian and he went on to study in the United States. He studied at Grinnell College, Iowa, and later returned to the US for military training at Fort Benning, Georgia. President Bashir came to an agreement with Garang Mr Garang's first taste of guerrilla warfare was at the start of the civil war with the southern-based Anya Anya movement in 1962. Ten years later, the Khartoum government signed a deal with Anya Anya and the south became a self-governing region. Mr Garang and others were absorbed in the government army and moved to Khartoum. But five years after oil was discovered in southern Sudan in 1978, the civil war erupted again - this time involving the government forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, SPLM, and its military wing, the SPLA. The ideological profile of SPLA was as shadowy as Mr Garang himself. John Garang did not tolerate dissent and anyone who disagreed with him was either imprisoned or killed    He varied from Marxism to drawing support from Christian fundamentalists in the US. There was always confusion on central issues such as whether the SPLA was fighting for independence for southern Sudan or merely more autonomy. Friends and foes alike found the SPLA's human rights record in southern Sudan and Mr Garang's style of governance disturbing. ""The SPLA has definitely changed quite a lot over the years for the better,"" Gill Lusk said as the war ground to a close. ""But in the past it was guilty of committing serious human rights violations in southern parts of the country. ""John Garang did not tolerate dissent and anyone who disagreed with him or the leadership was either imprisoned or killed."" The SPLA was accused of human rights abuses In the murky world of guerrilla warfare, John Garang survived attempts on his life from those within and outside his movement. ""He outfoxed everyone else by being cunning, by staying one step ahead,"" says Peter Verney, editor of Sudan Update and Independent Information Services. ""You can tell by the type of security around him whenever he travels."" But he was credited for keeping the movement together through turbulent times. By 1986 the SPLA was estimated to have 12,500 armed men, organized into 12 battalions and equipped with small arms and a few mortars, according to Sudan specialists who monitored the war. By 1989 the SPLA's strength had reached 20,000 to 30,000 and rose to between 50,000 to 60,000 in 1991. Speaking before his death, Peter Verney said a new Garang had been emerging out of the ashes of Sudan's bloody war. Sudan's civil war took nearly two million lives ""He has been consistent,"" Mr Verney argued. ""He has been carrying the hopes and aspirations of southern Sudanese - and he has known all along that they would ditch him if he didn't deliver."" ""He was aloof before, very much to himself. ""But we are seeing him now becoming more approachable, becoming a politician, even a statesman. ""There is a new sense of dignity and openness about him - or perhaps just PR."" His premature death leaves an unfulfilled mission, and great uncertainty in the south."
608,"A new tram stop at Victoria Station in Manchester has reopened after it closed 12 months ago as part of a wider £44m refurbishment at the site.  Trams from Bury and Rochdale are terminating at the stop as new platforms and tracks have been built in the Network Rail project.  Services through the station to reach Shudehill will resume on Saturday, once works along Balloon Street have ended.  Redevelopment of the site includes a new £20m roof.  During the closure, trams have been passing through Victoria in both directions on a single track without stopping for safety reasons.  Victoria-bound passengers have been alighting at Shudehill.  Peter Cushing, Transport for Greater Manchester's Metrolink director, said: ""Although there will still be a lot of construction activity in the station, it will restore key services and connections for passengers.""  The station roof had leaked since 1996 when a bomb, believed to have been planted by the IRA, exploded in the city centre."
609,"Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of a remarkable success for British intelligence: but one that involved spying on the United States and then conspiring with its senior officials to manipulate public opinion in America.  On the morning of 17 January 1917, Nigel de Grey walked into his boss's office in Room 40 of the Admiralty, home of British code-breakers.  It was obvious to Reginald ""Blinker"" Hall that his subordinate was excited.  ""Do you want to bring America into the war?"" de Grey asked.  The answer was obvious. Everyone knew that America entering World War One to fight the Germans would help break the stalemate.  ""Yes, my boy. Why?"" Hall answered.  ""I've got something here which - well, it's a rather astonishing message which might do the trick if we could use it,"" de Grey said.  The previous day, the German foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, had sent a message to the German ambassador to Washington.  The message used a code that had been largely cracked by British code-breakers, the forerunners of those who would later work at Bletchley Park.  Zimmermann had sent instructions to approach the Mexican government with what seems an extraordinary deal: if it was to join any war against America, it would be rewarded with the territories of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.  ""This may be a very big thing, possibly the biggest thing in the war. For the present, not a soul outside this room is to be told anything at all,"" Hall said after reading it.  Part of the problem was how the message had been obtained.  German telegraph cables passing through the English Channel had been cut at the start of the War by a British ship.  So Germany often sent its messages in code via neutral countries.  Germany had convinced President Wilson in the US that keeping channels of communication open would help end the War, and so the US agreed to pass on German diplomatic messages from Berlin to its embassy in Washington.  The message - which would become known as the Zimmermann Telegram - had been handed, in code, to the American Embassy in Berlin at 15:00 on Tuesday 16 January.  The American ambassador had queried the content of such a long message and been reassured it related to peace proposals.  By that evening, it was passing through another European country and then London before being relayed to the State Department in Washington.  From there, it would eventually arrive at the German embassy on 19 January to be decoded and then recoded and sent on via a commercial Western Union telegraphic office to Mexico, arriving the same day.  Thanks to their interception capability process, Britain's code-breakers were reading the message two days before the intended recipients (although they initially could not read all of it).  A coded message about attacking the US was actually passed along US diplomatic channels.  And Britain was spying on the US and its diplomatic traffic (something it would continue to do for another quarter of a century).  The cable was intelligence gold-dust and could be used to persuade America to join the War.  But how could Britain use it - when to do so would reveal both that they were breaking German codes and that they had obtained the message by spying on the very country it was hoping to become its ally?  Hall had all the copies locked in his desk while he decided what to do and asked for the rest to be decoded.  London was betting that Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare - attacking merchant shipping - would be enough to draw America into the War.  When the signs were that an extra push might be needed, it was decided to deploy the Zimmermann Telegram.  Room 40 asked one of its contacts to get hold of a copy of anything sent to the German embassy in Mexico from the US. This provided another copy of the telegram.  Britain could then plausibly claim this was how it had got hold of the message and get round the problem of admitting it was spying on its friends.  Britain also had to convince the Americans that the message had not been concocted as part of a ruse to get them into the War.  Eventually, the US obtained its own copy from the Western Union telegraphic company, and De Grey then decoded it himself in front of a representative at the US embassy in London.  This meant technically all parties could claim that it had been decoded on US territory.  ""Good Lord,"" President Wilson said when he was told of the details.  The telegram was then leaked to the American press and published to general amazement on 1 March 1917 (with credit attached to the American Secret Service rather than the British to avoid awkward questions of British manipulation).  Whatever scepticism was left was dispelled when Zimmermann himself took the odd move of confirming he had sent it. A month later, America was in the War.  It would be too much to claim the Zimmermann Telegram single-handedly brought America into the War.  Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare can take more credit for that.  But the telegram was useful for convincing the American public that it should be sending its men over to Europe to fight.  The telegram had proved the perfect justification for a change of policy and to convince some of the sceptics.  It was, many believed, the single greatest intelligence triumph for Britain in World War One.  It was also an early sign of the potential impact of intercepting communications, a lesson which the few British and American officials in on the real story were determined to learn from as they set about building their capability.  Early in World War Two, before America had formally entered the War, it would send a team of its best code-breakers on a clandestine mission to Britain to establish a relationship with their counterparts.  The Road to Bletchley Park exhibition at the former wartime site features a copy of the Zimmermann Telegram and details of its role.  Today, the two allies have GCHQ and the NSA - two vast intelligence agencies involved in interception and code-breaking.  They also have a pact which means that - on the whole - they are not supposed to spy on each other.  The BBC World Service Witness programme recently told the story of how the British managed to intercept the telegram, and heard from some of the code-breakers involved.

610,"I grew up in Wiltshire all too aware of the Ministry of Defence's major presence in the county, especially on Salisbury Plain.  We all knew that there were top secret establishments, including one where spooks and boffins researched mysterious and deadly weapons of germ warfare. That was Porton Down.  But the thought of getting anywhere near, let alone inside, never crossed anyone's mind.  Porton Down has long since been split into two establishments; one Ministry of Defence, the other civilian.  The latter is now on the front line of the effort to detect and minimise the risk of Ebola appearing in the UK. I was given rare and exclusive access to the site, run by Public Health England.  Known as PHE Porton, the centre carries out research on infectious diseases, and works with the private sector and universities on new products such as vaccines.  Crucially, given international concern about Ebola, Porton has a key role in response to potential emergencies.  This is where tests on suspected Ebola cases are carried out. Diagnostic services are provided for clinicians across the UK.  Porton Down has known all about Ebola since it was identified in 1976.  A closely guarded sample of the virus was brought to the UK to be examined and to allow further research.  But a potentially fatal mistake was made by a Porton scientist who accidentally came into contact with the virus in a laboratory.  He developed severe fever symptoms but survived after being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in North London (which has the facilities to treat any patients developing Ebola from the current outbreak).  That Ebola sample has remained at Porton ever since - in tightly controlled conditions.  It is part of a deadly collection which includes anthrax and plague. They are stored at temperatures as low as minus 80C (176F).  I was assured that the freezer units which contained these killer samples were behind several secure doors, each requiring access codes.  The corridors of Porton seem anonymous and little changed since the 1950s.  Only the occasional sign saying ""novel and dangerous pathogens"" and ""emergency showers"" betrayed the nature of the work being carried out. There is a brisk and businesslike atmosphere with no sense of panic or crisis.  The message from Porton is that Ebola is just one of a number of threats which are being monitored.  Officials have long been used to dealing with several samples every week, particularly at this time of year with many long-distance travellers arriving in the UK.  Doctors contact the Imported Fever Service run by Public Health England with details of cases needing further examination. Samples are then dispatched to Porton.  Lassa fever, yellow fever and dengue are high on the list of diseases which Porton is looking out for.  A testing process lasting about seven hours will look for traces of these and other viruses as well as Ebola.  There has been a threefold increase in the number of cases referred to Porton since Ebola gained a national media profile as clinicians take an ultra cautious approach.  So far no Ebola case has been identified in the UK.  Dr Tim Brooks, who heads up Porton's work on rare and imported pathogens, told me that he and his colleagues were not unduly concerned about Ebola because dealing with dangerous diseases was part of day-to-day life.  He said they were well practised in testing routines and how to handle positive cases.  In July this year the Porton team dealt with a case of the infectious and potentially deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.  A British traveller was said to have responded well to treatment. A patient who arrived in the UK with the fever in 2012 subsequently died.  Here on the site surrounded by woodland in the Wiltshire countryside, nobody is taking anything for granted.  But there is a sense that they are ready for anything and that they are well prepared should Ebola arrive in the UK."

President Egal said Somaliland was no longer just a collection of clans but a nation in its own right.  He said the results of the referendum also brought to an end the question of whether Somaliland should ever reunite with Somalia.

612,"Greater Manchester Police's chief constable has said he expects the new police and crime commissioner (PCC) Tony Lloyd ""to fight for GMP"".  Sir Peter Fahy said Mr Lloyd's key role was one of ""negotiating [with] and influencing"" other agencies locally and nationally.  Mr Lloyd said he would ""ask [senior police management] to make their case"" on what they wanted from him.  He added that ""if they don't make the case, then the answer will be 'no'"".  Mr Lloyd was elected to the position of Greater Manchester PCC last week in a ballot which saw 13.6% of the electorate cast a vote.  He said the government had done ""their best to make sure this election was covered in secrecy"" and repeated an accusation of ""incompetence"" which he made in his acceptance speech on Friday.  ""This was a new role that the government brought in but didn't explain why they had done, what the powers of the police commissioner were and why it mattered to the public,"" he said.  However, he said that having won the election he would ""make this work and make it work in the interest of the two and half million people in Greater Manchester"".  Mr Lloyd, who served as the MP for Manchester Central for 15 years, said that he had wanted the PCC role because in ""all the years I have been a MP, one of the abiding issues that people raised with me was fear of crime"".  ""That's why I want to work with the chief constable to make sure we have not simply the best police force in Britain but also the safest communities we can manage,"" he said.  Sir Peter said he was ""very, very clear"" that he and Mr Lloyd had to work together effectively.  But he said he did not think the relationship would ""feel hugely different"" from the one he had with Greater Manchester Police Authority, the body which the PCC has replaced.  ""The police authority did do a good job and absolutely held me to account and I think that will continue with the PCC,"" he said.  ""It's a different system and we will make that system work. I think there will be some advantages from having one single person to represent [all of Greater Manchester] and there will be some challenges in that.  He said one of the key roles of the PCC was ""negotiating and influencing the other local authorities, the health service, businesses and other organisations"".  ""We will be expecting him to fight for GMP at a national level with the Home Office [over] resourcing and changes to legislation.  ""I do think it will be from that influential position both locally and nationally where the post will prove itself.""  Mr Lloyd, who beat four other candidates to win 51.2% of first preference votes in the election, said he intended to ""listen to the chief constable and his senior management team, [as] they are the ones who have done practical policing over the years"".  ""I'm not going to come and say 'get three more people in that squad car' or 'you need the tactical aid unit in this area tonight',"" he said.  ""That's simply not the commissioner's role - what the role is is to build partnerships across the whole of the communities.  ""Policing is massively important in reducing crime, but so are many other agencies."""
613,"He is currently the managing director of the Barbican in London, which he described as ""a unique and wonderful arts centre"" upon his appointment in February.  Sir Nicholas, born on 23 February 1951, worked for the English Bach Festival and the BBC's music department before establishing himself as a journalist at the end of the 1970s.  He was a music critic for US magazine The New Yorker and British newspapers The Times and The Observer.  And he worked as an adviser to London's South Bank Centre, earning a Royal Philaharmonic Society award for its Mozart Now festival in 1991.  He took charge of Radio 3 in 1992, a high-profile year for classical music radio in the UK owing to the launch of national commercial station Classic FM.  While Classic FM took a ""greatest hits"" approach to the genre, gaining a bigger audience than its more established rival, Radio 3 continued to offer a high-brow mixture of recorded and session material, concerts and culture.  His responsibilities widened when he became director of the BBC Proms, a job he held until his appointment to the Barbican this year.  He relinquished his role at Radio 3 in 1998 to play an integral part in the BBC's Millennium programming.  And by 2000, Sir Nicholas was the controller not just of the Proms, but also of live events and classical music on TV.  At the Barbican he replaced Sir John Tusa, who retired after 12 years overseeing a venue which has branded itself ""the largest multi-arts centre in Europe"".  Sir Nicholas, who is married with four children, was appointed a CBE in 2001 for his services to music and Millennium broadcasting."
614,"Angela Cannings, whose convictions for killing her two sons were overturned in 2003, said she was ""disheartened"".  Donna Anthony, whose convictions for murdering her children were also overturned, said she just wanted an apology from the paediatrician.  His initial evidence was given in the case of solicitor Sally Clark.  She was convicted in 1999 of the murder of her two baby sons, but the verdict was later overturned in the appeal court.  During Mrs Clark's original trial, Sir Roy said the probability of two natural unexplained cot deaths in the family was 73 million to one.  The figure was later disputed by the Royal Statistical Society and other experts said that once genetic and environmental factors were taken into consideration, the odds of a second cot death in the same family were closer to 200 to one.  John Batt , a family friend and solicitor for the Clarks said: ""The family has been consistent right the way through - all they have wanted is that those who were responsible for this miscarriage of justice be called to account for what they did.  ""The fundamental point that the Clark family made is they wanted the people who put her in jail wrongly, for two heinous crimes that never happened, be called publicly to account for what they did and that has happened.""  Mrs Cannings' convictions for smothering her seven-week-old son Jason in 1991 and 18-week-old Michael in 1999 were overturned in 2003.  She told the BBC: ""On a personal level it's very hard for us to accept when expert witnesses do make mistakes in the courtroom and you have a knock-on devastation effect on families involved.  ""If an expert witness gives evidence in their field of expertise they should have no reluctance at all to go into a courtroom.  ""It's when they are approached about areas outside their expertise then they should look up and say 'sorry I can't deal with this, and actually step back.  ""But I believe in a lot of these cases this didn't happen and they were in effect encouraged to bring other evidence into the courtroom and we believe the devastating result is you do get families torn apart by what happens.""  Mrs Anthony was jailed for life in 1998 for killing her daughter Jordan, aged 11 months, in 1996 and four-month-old son Michael in 1997, but freed at her second appeal.  Speaking after the High Court verdict, she said she had ""mixed emotions"".  She told Sky News: ""It seems to me he is now able once again to ruin other people's lives just like he has mine.  ""Personally, all I have wanted for the last seven years is a simple apology and for him to admit he got it wrong.  ""He has never spoken to me, he has never written to me, he has never even telephoned me or any of my family, so how can he base an opinion purely just on what he has read?  ""He should have at least contacted the people he helped convict, if you will, to get some of their own personal feelings on things and he never did that with any of us."""
615,"Eight groups for the World Cup Finals will be drawn on Saturday from four ""pots"" containing the 32 qualifiers.  The first pot contains the eight seeded nations - chosen on ""sports, geographic and economic factors"".  Each of these seeds will be placed in their own group from Group A through to H.  The second stage involves Pot Two - which contains the 11 unseeded European nations.  Eight of these 11 countries will be pulled from the hat and placed in one of the eight groups.  That means four groups - those headed by France, Italy, Germany and Spain - will have two European teams.  The three remaining European nations from Pot Two will be drawn to play in the four groups which do not already contain two other European teams. Then the five teams in Pot Three will be allocated to a group, and finally the eight teams in Pot Four will be drawn. England and the Republic of Ireland could find themselves in the same group, as they did at the 1990 World Cup. But the chances are against that happening. One of the two countries would have to be in the first eight drawn from Pot Two with the other in the last three. Even then the first out would have to be drawn with a non-European seed.  The fact that Japan and Korea are both seeded means that England or Ireland could find themselves in relatively easy groups. Either could concievably end up with one of the host nations, plus two minnows such as Ecuador and Senegal. Or - just as conceivably - England or Ireland could find themselves in a group with Brazil, Portugal and Cameroon. The structure of the draw was settled on after Fifa took into account political pressure from all angles. Neither of the co-hosts, Japan and South Korea, wanted to be in a less attractive group from the other. They also wanted the most glamorous first-round fixtures to be spread between the two host nations.  Fifa wanted to make sure that no group contained more than two European teams. And football's governing body also bowed to a request from China not to play any of their group games in Japan. The ceremony - which will be presided over by Sepp Blatter - is expected to last 90 minutes. The world's football elite will be entertained during that time by American singer Anastacia and Greek composer Vangelis."
616,"At a news conference with the British Prime Minister Tony Blair in Washington - the first time Mr Bush had commented in detail on the report - the president said that a ""new approach"" was needed in Iraq. It is ""bad there"", he accepted.  He did however give some hints, and laid down some parameters. These can be matched against the study group's proposals to see how far he might go.  The first proposal is not that far out of line with current American thinking, though it goes well beyond the current gradualism of the US policy of handing over to Iraqi troops.  The problem for Mr Bush is that it sets a target date, which is fine for the next American presidential campaign in 2008, but which he has always rejected.  It was perhaps significant that he refused to be drawn on the date in his news conference but stressed instead that conditions on the ground would determine any withdrawal of troops.  So he is likely to accept the broad principle of the study group's plan but not the proposed practice.  Again, the second idea has been explored by the administration and tried to an extent. But what sanctions are available if the government fails to reach the milestones?  The US could hardly withdraw its military support unless open civil war erupted and it had little other choice. Again he avoided laying down rules in his public comments. Encouragement not punishment is the likely course.  As for the third, Mr Bush is hostile to Iran and Syria - and they to the US. While he might try something, it is doubtful if this will lead very far. He said as much, inviting both to join in but only on condition that they act in ways he regards as helpful.  As for the Israel/Palestine issue, it is now clear that Mr Blair has two objects in mind when he goes to the region. Both are aimed at unlocking the door to talks. The first is to get the release of the Israeli soldier held in Gaza and the second is to get a government of national unity among the Palestinians to lead negotiations.  Meanwhile, domestic sceptics are putting pressure on Mr Bush to resist going down the Iraq Study Group's path.  They feel the report had more to do with getting America out of Iraq than getting Iraq out of the war.  The right-wing backlash has already begun.  One of the leaders of the neo-conservative movement, William Kristol, called the report ""a disguised surrender"".  In an article in his magazine, the Weekly Standard, he said the report's proposal to draw down American combat forces by 2008 was much the same as those laid out previously by the Pentagon.  But he argued that it had not proved possible before and would not necessarily be possible in the future, even under the plan envisaged by the study group.  ""The real recommendation of the Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study group is 'stay the course'. For this we waited nine months?"" he wrote.  He added about President Bush: ""Right now we can only applaud the president's courage and determination and his willingness to resist the pressures of those who would now sound the retreat.""  Among the military there are misgivings about setting a target - and about relying on Iraq forces so quickly.  Retired General Barry McCaffrey, who fought during the 1991 Gulf War, said that while the principle of handing over to the Iraqis was correct, those US troops left behind as advisers might find themselves in danger. ""They came up with a political thought but then got to tinkering with tactical ideas that in my view don't make any sense. This is a recipe for national humiliation,"" he said.  And some Iraqis fear that the report does not address Iraqi issues so much as American ones.  ""It is a report to solve American problems, not to solve Iraqi problems,"" a leading Sunni politician was quoted as saying in the Washington Post."
617,"Sweden's royal family has rejected allegations of links between the German-born queen's late father and the Nazi regime in Germany.  Queen Silvia has published a report she commissioned in response to claims her father took over a factory from a Jewish businessman.  The report concluded that Walter Sommerlath had in fact helped the Jewish man escape from Germany.  But a Holocaust survivors' group said the findings were a ""whitewash"".  Last year, Swedish commercial broadcaster TV4 reported that Mr Sommerlath had taken advantage of the Nazi's ""Aryanisation"" programme to take over a factory belonging to Jewish businessman Efim Wechsler in 1939.  But the new, 34-page report, compiled by Swedish World War II expert Erik Norberg, indicated that Mr Sommerlath had allowed Mr Wechsler to escape from Germany by trading the factory for a coffee plantation in Brazil.  The report confirmed that Mr Sommerlath - who died in 1990 - had gone to Brazil in 1920, aged 20, where he met and married the queen's Brazilian mother Alice, whose family owned the large plantation.  The American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants reacted to the report by dismissing it as ""self-serving"" and lacking in credibility.  ""The report was not an independent inquiry - it was commissioned by the queen with the participation of her cousin, a Brazilian lawyer,"" the organisation said in a statement quoted by the Associated Press news agency.  ""Such a probe can only raise suspicions of a whitewash.""  Queen Silvia has faced criticism in Swedish media for a number of years for not doing more to address the rumours of her father's role in Germany during World War II."
618,"Nearly five decades have passed since the UK's first out-of-town superstore opened its doors. It differed starkly from the outlets used by millions today, but it helped change British shopping forever.  They circle the nation's suburbs, giant caverns of consumerism piled high with bulk-bought perishables.  Plenty of people loathe them, but millions rely on them. Out-of-town superstores - bigger, uglier brothers of standard-sized supermarkets - are an inescapable part of the modern British landscape.  Ubiquitous as they may be today, however, it's less than half-a-century since the first such outlet in the UK was launched.  When the country's first large-scale edge-of-city superstore was launched in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, the British public had never seen anything like it.  This vast new building boasted 110,000 sq ft (10,200 sq m) of floor space. It sold a spectacular array of groceries, hardware, furniture and clothes all under one roof, and there were parking spaces for 1,000 cars.  It boasted some 50 departments, including a pharmacy, sports goods, records, a restaurant, toys, a hairdresser, shoe repairs and carpets. Its stock and shop fittings were reportedly worth £700,000 - a huge figure at the time.  Developments like this would later be blamed for crushing independent traders, emptying out High Streets and imposing a stultifying homogeneity on the nation's retail habits.  But at a time when most Britons did their shopping in the local grocer, and memories of wartime rationing were fresh, this huge vision of consumer abundance symbolised a new era of modern affluence to many.  On its opening weekend in November 1964, an estimated 30,000 people and 5,000 cars visited the store, causing traffic jams for miles around.  Carole Foote, who was 21 years old in 1964 when she first travelled across Nottingham to visit the newly opened West Bridgford retailer, recalls her father gazing upon the store with wonderment.  ""I can remember dad standing, looking, his face absolutely amazed. And he said, 'I think we're going to have a good time here.'""  It was operated by Gem International Supercentres Incorporated, a US-owned firm which hoped to bring American shopping habits to Britain.  Today a branch of Asda is located on its Nottinghamshire site, and few people are aware of the pivotal role it played in British retail history.  At the time, the progenitors of today's supermarkets had already made forays into the British shopping landscape.  Sainsbury's opened its first self-service store - where customers collected their own groceries in baskets, rather than queuing to order items from assistants standing behind counters - in Croydon, Surrey, in 1950, and the format spread to High Streets across the country.  But these were far from the vast warehouse-like retail units that dominate the modern landscape. The West Bridgford outlet was the first edge-of-town outlet, aimed at motorists and their families, on the kind of scale with which 21st Century customers would be familiar.  So novel was the concept that local newspapers didn't quite know what to call it.  ""A new American-style supercentre,"" one reporter described it. Another termed the edifice a ""shopping plaza"".  In its own publicity, however, Gem called it a ""one-stop one-level department store"".  The arrival of this American-style development was national news.  ""THE WINDOWLESS STORE MAKES ITS DEBUT,"" ran the headline in The Times.  The lack of plate glass required explanation to the consumers of 1964.  ""We need the wall space for our merchandise, and windows in general are out for the car shopper - he drives in, he stops at our parking lot, and he walks right out,"" Herman FE Trost, Gem's general manager of development, told the paper.  According to Phil Lyon, a retail historian at Queen Margaret University Edinburgh, this was perhaps the store's most enduring legacy.  ""Since the 1930s you had these impressive window displays - the shops had to create them to get people in the shop,"" he says.  Now in West Bridgford, however, there was no attempt to attract passing trade. Instead they would be invited to make a trip in their cars with a promise of bulk-bought produce and the cheapest petrol in the area.  ""Pretty soon, you never saw anything in supermarket windows apart from the odd poster,"" Lyon adds.  Today an outlet on this scale would take months, if not years, to gain approval from a local authority.  But although there had been objections from local traders fearful of the impact on trade, a public inquiry into the planning application had taken just three days.  It took nine months and £500,000 to build the supermarket and its car park.  However, at first the development was not a success. It would take Asda, a British firm, to make this most American of concepts work.  By November 1965, Gem was complaining of ""the innate conservative outlook, the ingrained prejudices of the trading community in this country"".  Barely two years after it opened, sales stood at a disappointing £6,000 a week. Gem sold its stake in the unit to a new partnership, the Leeds-based Asda.  In some ways the UK was not yet ready for the American-style retail experience. As late as 1967, just 47% of households owned refrigerators, compared with 90% in the US.  But ultimately Gem's British venture failed because the West Bridgford site was not yet a true supermarket as we would understand the concept today, says Paul Whysall, professor of retailing at Nottingham Business School.  ""It advertised itself as a department store and within that there were a number of franchises,"" he says.  Each of these franchises ran a different department within the store, he says. Shoppers were supposed to stay within colour-coded floor markings before paying for goods but were frequently confused by the system.  ""There was a problem with shoplifting,"" says Whysall. ""People didn't realise that they'd wandered from one department to another.""  Asda's owners wanted to create a large-scale, low-cost supermarket. It was also keen to take advantage of a recent law banning retail price maintenance, whereby shops were required by manufacturers to sell their products at a minimum price or above.  In came a superstore on the scale never before seen in the UK.  The emphasis was on low prices. Bigger volumes meant customers could be charged less. Some food lines were 17% cheaper than those offered by competitors.  In its first week of operating the store, Asda made £30,000. Six months later, sales had doubled.  Chris Stockdale, son of Asda co-founder Noel Stockdale, says that what happened at West Bridgford transformed the retail industry.  ""It provided our customers with the opportunity to buy most of their household needs at very competitive prices,"" he says. ""It really was part of a shopping revolution.""  This new system reflected the pace of social change.  With women increasingly going out to work, families could not depend on housewives traipsing round High Streets every day to buy that evening's meal. Thanks to the increasing presence of the refrigerator in their homes, many were now doing a weekly rather than a daily shop.  The modern superstore - on the edge of town, surrounded by parking spaces, selling a huge range of low-cost produce in bulk - was born.  It was not a development that was universally popular. Asda was accused of damaging trade in the centre of Nottingham, and other chains that followed suit across the country have faced similar accusations ever since.  According to Whysall, the small town of West Bridgford itself was not too badly affected, however. The 10 stores on its main parade have remained more or less continuously occupied since Gem's arrival, he says, although their businesses have changed over time - the grocer, hardware shop and draper disappearing to make way for a Thai restaurant, a betting shop and a laundrette.  If Gem did not dramatically change West Bridgford itself, the superstore undoubtedly helped shape modern Britain.

619,"A convicted child killer has been found guilty of the murder of a teenager in Berkshire 46 years ago.  Yolande Waddington, 17, was found strangled in the village of Beenham in October 1966.  David Burgess, 64, was jailed for life in 1967 for the killing of nine-year-old girls Jeanette Wigmore and Jacqueline Williams in Beenham.  He was charged with Yolande's murder following advances in DNA techniques and convicted after a five-week trial.  The jury at Reading Crown Court convicted Burgess by a majority verdict of 11 to one.  Jurors had been deliberating since Monday.  Speaking on behalf of the family outside court, Yolande's brother Giles Waddington broke down as he read from a statement.  He said: ""We're grateful that justice has now been completed and that Yolande's murderer has been identified after more than 45 years.  ""Yolande's murder had a traumatic and irreversible effect on our family life and has cast a long shadow over nearly five decades.""  Yolande had only recently moved to the village to work as a nanny at a farm when she was killed.  She was last seen alive at the Six Bells pub on the evening of Friday, 28 October 1966.  During the trial, the jury heard Yolande's naked body was discovered in a ditch beside a farmer's barn two days later.  She had been stabbed and strangled and tied up with a jumper knotted around her face.  Blood from Yolande's attacker had been found on a number of items, including her comb and hair band.  Detectives from Scotland Yard were sent to Beenham to help with the investigation and carried out the first ever mass blood screening, with samples taken from 200 males in the area aged between 16 and 60.  A sample supposedly from Burgess was also taken, but it failed to meet one of the tests and was deemed not to be a match.  Police believe he may have got someone else to give a sample on his behalf or the specimen was labelled incorrectly.  Last year, Thames Valley Police carried out a review into the case and using a new technique obtained a partial DNA profile which matched Burgess's.  Pete Beirne, the force's principal investigator of cold cases, said: ""David Burgess has never accepted his guilt despite confessing to the crime to prison officers on three separate occasions.  ""He has never fully explained how or why he killed Yolande."""

621,"Irvine Welsh’s first novel, Trainspotting (1993), is set mostly in Leith and Edinburgh in the 1980s and consists of a series of loosely connected episodes which follow Welsh’s characters as they tell their stories of sex, drugs and dance music. The novel’s energy comes in part from the degree to which Welsh gives such distinctive voices to each of his characters, expecting his readers to tune in and recognise them with the first few words they speak.  Trainspotting gained notoriety for its depiction of Edinburgh heroin culture; the novel is set at a time when Edinburgh was thought to be the ‘HIV capital of Europe’. While heroin is undoubtedly crucial to many of the narratives in Welsh’s first novel, Trainspotting draws its readers’ attention to aspects of Scottish and British culture which are perhaps even more uncomfortable. Trainspotting talks about poverty, sectarianism, racism and attitudes towards disability, above all insisting that if there is no such thing as society, there is certainly no such thing as a classless society.  Welsh’s characters are often highly sceptical about the ability of therapists, activists or politicians to change society for the better. For Mark Renton, the state’s attempt to bring him off heroin is a symptom of society’s inability to deal with someone who has consciously chosen to reject its values; ‘ah choose no tae choose life. If the cunts cannae handle that, it’s thair fuckin problem’ (Trainspotting, 188). Renton insists on his individual right to opt out of society, to take his life in his own hands, and refuses to allow society the option to view his rejection as a curiosity of medical science. This individualism also marks a rejection of socialist representations of the Scottish working class, which insisted upon class solidarity and the potential of collective action.  Welsh followed Trainspotting with a novella and collection of short stories called The Acid House (1994). One aspect of the use of drugs in Welsh’s fiction is that it has allowed him to integrate elements of fantasy into his portrayals of urban life. So, in the title story, ‘The Acid House’, Welsh has Hibs casual Coco Bryce exchange minds with a young baby, and then follows the baby and Coco as their mother and girlfriend try to make them into the men they want them to be. Elsewhere, in ‘The Granton Star Cause’ Boab meets God in the pub and is then turned into a bluebottle.  Whereas Trainspotting is told in a cacophonous surround sound, Marabou Stork Nightmares (1995) is a monologue. Roy Strang is in a coma after a failed suicide attempt. He uses fantasy to avoid remembering the real life that has brought him here, from his childhood in Muirhouse, through his family’s attempt to make a new life for themselves in apartheid South Africa and Roy’s subsequent return to Scotland and time as a football casual. The comparison Roy makes between the poor of Edinburgh and black South Africans under apartheid, along with the novel’s representation of rape, has made Marabou Stork Nightmares the most controversial of Welsh’s books to date.  For Glue (2001), Irvine Welsh returned to the polyphonic style he employed in Trainspotting. Glue is Welsh’s longest book to date and also his most ambitious in scope. For the first time in an Irvine Welsh novel he takes us through three decades of his characters’ lives, from the 1970s to the early years of the new millennium. This allows Welsh to explore his four principal characters, Terry Lawson, Carl Ewart, Billy Birrell and Andrew Galloway, as they develop and change over time, charting their reactions to the changing world around them.  The novel begins with its four characters’ parents in a Scotland so markedly different from the Scotland of Welsh’s earlier novels. It then moves to their children as they grow up in 1970s Edinburgh, beginning with Terry Lawson’s first day at school. The novel varies between a third person narrative and the distinctive individual voices of its characters. The early section of Glue takes the traditional ‘young man growing up’ narrative and transforms it, replacing the individual focus of that form with an examination of how different people develop differently under similar circumstances. Welsh also takes away the soft-focus lens, refusing to censor his characters or sanitise their experiences. As Glue progresses, and its characters move from childhood to youth to middle age, it explores, in a more sustained way than elsewhere in Welsh’s work, the solidarity rejected at the end of Trainspotting. Glue is about friendship as much as it is about anger and inequality.  Porno, the sequel to Trainspotting, was published in 2002. The events of the novel can be dated quite precisely, occurring after the opening of the new Scottish Parliament, but before Alex McLeish left Welsh’s beloved Hibernian football club to manage Rangers. In Porno, Welsh brings the Trainspotting characters back together, still suffering from the collective hangover caused by Mark Renton’s getaway to Amsterdam at the end of the earlier novel. It is a common feature of Welsh’s fiction that characters from one book have cameo roles in another, creating a sense that each of Welsh’s stories takes place within a wider world in which there is always something going on offstage."

624,"Thousands of Georgians have protested in the capital Tbilisi against a gay rights rally being held to mark the international day against homophobia.  They broke through police barricades and carried stinging nettles with which to beat activists. Some posters read: ""We don't need Sodom and Gomorrah"".  Police were forced to bus the 50 or so activists out of the city centre to avoid further violence.  Several people, including a journalist and a police officer, were injured.  The protests followed comments from the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church.  Patriarch Ilia II had urged the authorities not to allow the gay pride rally to go ahead, saying it was a ""violation of the majority's rights"" and ""an insult"" to the Georgian nation.  This wasn't a crowd of right-wing extremists. These were ordinary Georgians: many were respectable-looking older women, well-dressed young men or elderly grandfathers. Led by priests from the Georgian Orthodox Church, with long white beards and dressed in flowing black cassocks, the fired-up crowd easily broke through police lines. Thousands of protesters then surged through, cheering and chanting, as the few dozen gay activists in the central square were hurriedly pushed onto buses by police. Young male protesters gave chase, throwing rocks at the windows or pursuing in cars. Those gay activists who managed to scramble onto the buses in time escaped. Others were not so lucky, and were chased down the streets or trapped in shops by angry mobs chanting anti-gay slogans.  He described homosexuality as a disease and compared it to drug addiction.  The BBC's Damien McGuinness in Tbilisi says the Patriarch is by far the most respected public figure in Georgia, with approval ratings consistently at around 90%.  All the anti-gay demonstrators our correspondent spoke to said the Patriarch's comments had inspired them to attend Friday's protest, which was organised with the help of Orthodox priests.  ""We won't allow these sick people to hold gay parades in our country,"" said one woman holding a bunch of nettles. ""It's against our traditions and morals.""  Such attempts to halt an officially-approved rally have dismayed gay activists and the authorities in Georgia.  ""These people [the activists] should have the right to express their views and to hold demonstrations,"" said Nino Bolkvadeze, a lawyer with the non-governmental organisation Identity.  A similar rally held last year ended in the same way.  Georgia - a former soviet republic - is keen to join the European Union.  There are concerns that this aspiration could be undermined if Georgia's authorities appear unable to guarantee sexual minorities the right to demonstrate safely, our correspondent says."
625,"The inspiration for the design is Roman - complete with doors including the letters S.P.Q.L. which are an adaptation of ‘Senatus Populusque Romanus’ and mean to the Senate and People of Liverpool!

The long sides of the hall are divided in 5 bays by columns made of polished porphyry. The Organ    This was added by Cockerell and was intended as the musical foundation for events in the hall. The addition of the organ required that 2 of the original granite columns be removed, these were eventually transferred to the entrance of Sefton Park. Play us a tune on the old joanna. The bellows for the organ were originally powered by the steam engine in the basement but in 1931 the organ was enlarged to 120 stops (from 100) and converted to electro-pneumatic action.    The first organist was Mr WT Best in 1855, after the opening. The refurbishment of the organ will cost nearly £500,000 and is aimed to be completed in line with the other works. It is made of two sections. The central sunken section and the outside border. Made of encaustic tiles by Minton there are an estimated 30,000 tiles used. The difference in wear between the two sections is due to the decision taken in 1860 to cover the central well with a wooden floor to provide a more suitable surface for dancing."
626,"She had performed the unusual feat of winning re-election, despite the mass unemployment her battle against inflation had seen.  But Thatcher took fewer votes than in 1979. Her landslide was caused by the almost equal split in support between Labour and the SDP-Liberal Alliance.  For Labour the 1983 election had been an unmitigated disaster. The only consolation for leader Michael Foot was that Labour had not lost second place to the strong challenge posed by the Alliance.  But although the Alliance could talk up the seven million votes it received it had actually won very few seats - leaving its dream of a breakthrough just that, a dream.  Margaret Thatcher's first administration got off to a fairly shaky start. Her attempt to take the economy by the scruff of the neck and wage a crusade against inflation saw massive unemployment.  If such voter anger was to continue the Conservatives looked like they would be continuing the by now familiar merry go round of Tory governments followed by Labour.  But luckily for the Conservatives Labour had troubles of its own - in spades. The adoption of the principled and high-minded Michael Foot as leader saw the party shift dramatically to the left in opposition.  Leading members of Labour's pro-European wing felt the party no longer had any place for them and in 1981 more than 20 MPs left Labour as Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers set up the Social Democratic Party.  The SDP quickly got into bed with the Liberals, forming the Alliance. The extent to which the new party captured the public imagination was shown when some polls placed them ahead of not just the Tories but Labour as well.  But their support was to wane with the onset of the Falklands War in 1982.  Thatcher's success in re-taking the Falkland Islands after an invasion by Argentina was a very risky venture, but for the loss of 255 servicemen the islands were re-taken.  This bold, decisive move seemed to have been in step with the times, and the Tories now had a grip on power that would remain unshakeable for years.  When the election date was set for 9 June 1983, the pollsters at least were certain that a Thatcher victory was inevitable.  Perhaps a more interesting fight would be the battle between Labour and the Alliance for second place.  Since going down to Thatcher's first election victory in 1979 Labour had changed leaders and marched firmly to the left.  Leading the party into his first and last election battle Michael Foot fought a poor campaign, lacking in organisation as well as the necessary money, not to mention a series of policies that the voters could not support.  The Alliance, although more measured in its pitch to the voters, also suffered from a lack of funds, and Roy Jenkins, its ""prime minister designate"" fared badly in his role as figurehead.  By contrast the Conservatives under Cecil Parkinson ran a highly professional operation.  Money was not a problem, new computer systems were invested in and new techniques such as direct mail were employed to good effect.  And stiff measures were taken against complacent Tory voters when around 1,000 copies of the Labour manifesto were bought and distributed to supporters to help remind them what a Labour government might entail.  The commanding figure of Margaret Thatcher, fresh from victory in the Falklands War, cast a dominant presence over the 1983 election.  The conflict, from April to June 1982, had succeeded in turning Thatcher's strong personality and resolve into a formidable electoral asset for the Tories.  Although in possession of a sharp mind, Labour leader Michael Foot was seen by few as the best possible choice for prime minister in what was presented as an electoral contest between Foot and Thatcher as much as it was between Tory and Labour.  Foot, a former journalist, was the choice of the party's left and his policies drew little support, even from the former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.  His leadership saw the Labour split that lead to the Alliance's birth.  Roy Jenkins, the former Labour chancellor and home secretary, was initially the key figure of their campaign but as he failed to create an impression with the voters his presence was scaled down, and the Alliance's ratings grew in response.  The Conservative manifesto, Forward - the Challenge of Our Times, showed a party hoping to become more radical during a second term.  Reform of the trade unions' political levy was floated, as was a programme of privatisation that was to include British Telecom, British Airways and British Steel.  And the metropolitan councils, all Labour strongholds, as well as the Greater London Council were to be scrapped.  Labour's left wing programme, rambling and radical in equal measure, was referred to by a member of the shadow cabinet as the ""longest suicide note in history"".  It contained pledges towards unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Community as well as the abolition of the House of Lords.  While the Alliance in its offering - Working Together for Britain - promised to reduce unemployment by up to a million.  It also pledged proportional representation and devolution for Scotland and Wales, and called for compulsory balloting before unions could undertake strike action."
627,"A Kent theatre is set to be demolished after a council said it could not afford to carry out repairs on the building.  The curtains will come down for a final time later after a performance of the pantomime Peter Pan.  Southborough Town Council said it would need to spend more than £200,000 on structural repairs if the theatre was to stay open.  About £7,000 was spent on temporary seating when the theatre was sued after several children caught their fingers in the tip-up seats.  The building would need work on the flooring, roof, toilets and disability access if it was to remain open as a theatre, the council said.  Peter Oakford, chairman of the council, said: ""We haven't taken this decision lightly.  ""We fully understand why this ancient theatre has a place in the hearts of many Southborough residents, but we have to be realistic.""  He said the council had been ""fighting for at least the last eight years"" to keep the theatre open.  A Facebook page has been set up by campaigners fighting to save the building.  Mark Leman posted; ""Just been to see Peter Pan and would be very sad if this was the last Southborough panto, I have been going to them since I was a young lad.""  The theatre was built to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria and opened to the public in 1900.  Adele Ebbage, chairwoman of the Friends of the Royal Victoria Theatre, said: ""We'll keep fighting until the wrecking ball goes in the wall."""
628,"The BBC has defended defended its Blue Planet series, about life in the world's oceans, after it was revealed that some of its footage was shot in a lobster tank. As part of the £7m series, a sequence of lobsters spawning in the Atlantic off Nova Scotia was actually filmed in an Anglesey aquarium.    I would say 2% of the whole series has been filmed in tanks    But the corporation said this was to protect the environment. Blue Planet, which is in eight parts and is narrated by Sir David Attenborough, features the lobsters in the fifth episode. A BBC spokesman said: ""Unique footage of lobsters was shot in the sea off Nova Scotia. It took three weeks to film. ""The final 30-second sequence involved macro-photographic footage of some specific lobsters spawning and was taken at Anglesey Sea Zoo, north Wales. ""It would have been unethical and physically impossible to shoot this physical process in the wild as it would have caused unnecessary and unacceptable disturbance, while doing it at Anglesey did not cause this."" He added that the sequence showed a biological process that ""could not be shown in any other way"" and that the sequence shown was ""in no way fake"". Series producer Alastair Fothergill told The Sun newspaper that the programme rarely referred to the location because it ""wasn't the point"". He said: ""I would say 2% of the whole series has been filmed in tanks."" The BBC spokesman added the corporation was ""totally satisfied"" that it would have been ""impractical and unethical"" to have filmed the biological process in the wild. ""The resulting footage allows the viewer to witness an amazing process they would not have been able to otherwise,"" he said. The Blue Planet spans the length and breadth of the world's seas. It takes viewers to the water's murkiest depths and shows the array of wildlife that depends on the ocean to live. The series was co-funded by the US TV network the Discovery Channel. It has been sold to several other countries before its broadcast in the UK. Twenty specialist camera teams were employed to film 200 locations around the world, descending as far as 3,962 metres (13,000ft). It captures the previously unseen behaviour of many creatures, such as dolphins. Each programme in the series is followed by a 10-minute short called Making Waves, in which cameramen describe their cutting-edge techniques."

630,"Dave Evans is one of a group of 30 Cornish men and women who decided to travel to Mexico to try and re-trace the path of their ancestors who set off from Cornwall to start a new life in Mexico.  He and his fellow travellers are members of the Cornish Mexican Cultural Society who are making the journey for both personal and official reasons.  Councillor June Charman, the Mayor of Camborne, is also making the journey to reinforce the community links between Camborne and Mexico.  They are accompanied and helped in their search by historian Richard Williams.  In 1825 a band of 60 Cornishmen left Falmouth with 1500 tons of mining machinery.  They were leaving a Cornwall enjoying a booming mining industry and planned to travel to Real del Monte, deep in the Mexican interior, to use their skills and technology to rescue its ailing silver mining industry.  It was to be a difficult journey for many reasons.  Following the long sea voyage they tried to put into port in Mexico, only to find that it was held by the Spanish.     They were forced to land the machinery on the beach at Mocambo and then haul it through jungle and swamp to their first depot at Santa Fe.  This was just the first of many setbacks - recorded faithfully by John Buchanan, an engineer in the party who kept a diary of the journey.  It is largely because of the diary that we are able to follow their hardships and triumphs today.  During this haul through the jungle, the 'sickly season' started and both the Cornishmen and their Mexican helpers fell victim to the ravages of Yellow Fever.  It was three months before they were able to return to continue transporting the machinery and progress was painfully slow because they had to build their own road as they went.  It took them 14 months to travel just 250 miles - no wonder Mexicans call it 'The Great Trek'.  On May 1st 1826, they finally entered Real del Monte, the highest town in Mexico at 10,000 feet above sea level.  As engineer John Buchanan reported in his diary: ""After great labour and many accidents we conquered this great ascent and our convoy proceeded on our last stage to deposit its valuable cargo in Real del Monte"".  The Cornish community flourished and stayed for the best part of a century - until the Mexican revolution in 1910.  They have never been forgotten according to Cornish descendant Ricardo Ludlow.  They bake as many pasties here as in the whole of Cornwall, albeit spiced up for the Mexican palette, and it is said that the first game of Mexican soccer was played in the yard of the Dolores Mine!  Our modern-day group are travelling in the comfort of a coach and are feted along the way in towns like Vera Cruz where they attend a demonstration of traditional Mexican dancing.  But while the main party attend civic functions to welcome them, Dave Evans has gone on ahead to try and get a head start on the search for remaining members of his family.  He finally strikes gold in Pachuca's mining archives where he finds employment details of both his grand and great grandfathers.  Then a chance meeting with the hotel accountant, Julio Rivero, leads Dave to news of another relative - his great cousin Betty, who taught English to Julio.  Unfortunately 'Miss Betty', as the former teacher was known, has now died - but Julio thinks he can help Dave find his grandfather's and father's house.  Dave presents her with the official Cornish Mexican Cultural Society badge as a thank you for her family's help in tracing his roots.  Seven hundred Cornish men and women are buried in the cemetery overlooking Real del Monte and the local community hold a moving memorial ceremony in honour of their Cornish visitors - with 'Abide With Me' sung in Spanish.  Hunting among the graves, Dave finds many more than he expected, including those of his cousin Betty, and his Uncle William's - who's death at this point, however, still remains a mystery.  But once home, Dave receives an e-mail from a Patrica Gomez Evans.  She has news about Dave's uncle William so he rings her to find out what she knows.  It turns out that Patricia is William's grand daughter but she has some upsetting news.  It appears that William committed suicide by shooting himself.  Dave explains that this could be a result of shell shock William suffered from fighting in World War I.  He is already planning another trip to Mexico to meet Patricia to find out more about his Cornish Mexican family.  This is just the start of another journey of discovery to discover the links between Cornwall and Mexico..."
631,"Pete Doherty, a singer and guitarist with The Libertines, pleaded guilty at Horseferry Road Magistrates court in London to breaking into a flat belonging to his friend and fellow frontman Carl Barat.  The list of items taken from Barat's Harley Street flat on 25 July included an antique guitar, laptop, video recorder, CD player, mouth organ and books.  Mr Doherty, 24, from Kensington, west London, was granted bail on Monday.  His case has been adjourned until 8 September for pre-sentence reports.  The Libertines are one of the most promising new British rock bands to appear over the last year, with three top 40 singles.  Doherty has been absent from the band's line-up in recent months because he was ""unwell"", and the remaining three members played a UK tour without him.  But it is unclear whether Doherty has left the band for good."

633,"The star is an ancient 16-pointed golden symbol found on tombs and artefacts across the region.  It originated from the vergina tombs on a golden casket from the tomb of Philip, father of Alexander The Great. But this archaeological find had already long been a part of Greek identity - causing a massive diplomatic row.  ""The new Macedonian republic, in voting for a new flag - a red background and golden star, or as they termed it, sun, which was a 16-pointed symbol - was immediately interpreted by parties in Greece as a clear statement of territorial ambition,"" Keith Brown, of the Watson institute for international studies, told BBC World Service's The World Today programme.  ""[It was seen as] a symbolic threat to Greek national identity and its relationship with the past.""  Ancient Macedonia covered parts of modern Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and the Former Yugoslav Republic Of Macedonia.  The symbolic weight of the Vergina Star is such that the name vergina is used as name for many restaurants and shops in both Macedonia and Greece.  Already angry at the use of the name Macedonia, which is also one of Greece's northern provinces, Athens insisted the flag be changed.  It eventually was, becoming the current yellow-and-red Sun flag, and the country agreed to go by the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Macedonian archaeologist Bajana Mojsov told The World Today the symbolic weight attached to the Vergina Star was archaeologically absurd - but politically inevitable.  ""The star of vergina applies to the 3rd Century BC northern Greece - a very different situation, not related to the 21st Century AD.  ""I think it's modern politics, and we're witnessing the use of an archaeological symbol for history that it's really not related to.""  Although Macedonian-Greek relations have since improved, the dispute shows how archaeology can play a key part in nation-building - the discipline itself emerged alongside 19th Century nationalism.  ""It developed because nation states needed it for prestige and history and authenticity,"" stated Neal Ascherson, editor of Public Archaeology magazine.  ""Basically, it was hugely useful to nervous people unsure of their own authenticity wanting to prove it with the spade.""  Some archaeologists argue that throughout history data has been unscrupulously misused.  Adolf Hitler was so fond of archaeology that he gave the SS secret service special archaeological units, so that they could dig to prove a Nazi ideological bond of soil and nationhood.  Meanwhile, both Nazi and Soviet archaeologists interpreted the same evidence to prove that Poland was Germanic or Slav.  Similar abuses occurred during the Balkans conflicts following Yugoslavia's break-up - not just in Macedonia, but throughout the region, argued Stasa Babic of Belgrade University.  ""We didn't put any effort to fight these kinds of bogus stories,"" Dr Babic said.  ""Data never speaks for itself. We interpret it, and whenever we interpret it we read in our own political stances.  ""Archaeology can't be neutral. We have to be aware of it and we have to admit it."""
634,"Rwanda becomes a member of the Commonwealth  Some 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda's genocide in 1994 The Commonwealth has admitted Rwanda as its 54th member. The African country was admitted at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Trinidad and Tobago, a statement from the group said. A Rwandan minister said the move showed his country's ""tremendous progress"" over the last 15 years. The former colony of Germany and Belgium is the second country to be admitted without a British colonial past or constitutional link to Britain. Mozambique is the only other Commonwealth member without historic UK ties. Information Minister Louise Mushikiwabo is quoted by the online edition of the Rwandan daily New Times as saying Rwanda was pleased by its admission. ""My government sees this accession as recognition of the tremendous progress this country has made in the last 15 years,"" she said ""Rwandans are ready to seize economic, political, cultural and other opportunities offered by the Commonwealth network."" A report in July by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) urged Rwanda to tackle a lack of political freedom and harassment of journalists before it was admitted. It also articulated deep reservations over the country's human rights record. ""CHRI acknowledges that Rwanda has what appears to be a well-deserved reputation for governmental efficiency and for being less corrupt than a number of other countries - but its claims about the lack of corruption appear hollow when considering its complicity in the illicit economy of the region,"" the report said. Rwanda expressed its desire to join the Commonwealth in 2008, despite its historic association with Francophone countries. Relations between France and Rwanda have been poor for years. A French judge implicated Rwanda's President Paul Kagame in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, an accusation which he rejected. The Rwandan government has accused France of having backed the forces that went on to instigate the genocide. The Rwandan New Times said Rwanda's bid to join the group was supported by Britain, Australia, Canada and India. It also had the backing of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and the host country Trinidad and Tobago, among others.     "
635,"The Ministry of Defence has announced 4,200 job cuts in a second round of armed forces redundancies.  The Army will see up to 2,900 job cuts, including 400 Gurkhas, while the RAF will lose up to 1,000 members and the Royal Navy up to 300.  The job losses will account for some of the cuts announced under the defence review - intended to help plug a £38bn hole in the defence budget.  Ministers said there was ""no choice"" but to axe the posts.  Under the terms of the Strategic Defence and Security Review, announced in 2010, the navy and the RAF have to cut 5,000 jobs each by 2015, the Army 7,000 and the Ministry of Defence 25,000 civilian staff.  Last September 2,860 people were selected for the first tranche of redundancies, with the Army and RAF each losing 920 posts, and 1,020 cut from the navy.  Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the government had ""no choice but to reduce the size of the armed forces - while reconfiguring them to ensure they remain agile, adaptable and effective"".  Mr Hammond said: ""As we continue with the redundancy process we will ensure we retain the capabilities that our armed forces will require to meet the challenges of the future.""  The pain of these redundancies is being spread across most ranks. In terms of numbers it is the Gurkhas who will be hit the hardest - a move likely to anger campaigners who lobbied for equal pay and conditions for them. All three services are asking for volunteers but some redundancies are likely to be compulsory, as many who wanted to go left in the last round of cuts and job prospects outside the armed forces are rather bleaker now. Some service personnel will be exempt - unless they volunteer - including those serving on the frontlines in Afghanistan, those preparing to go and the recently returned. Both the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force expect this to be their last round of job losses, with natural wastage and a recruitment freeze in some areas making up for the rest. Announcements on who's being made redundant are likely to be made in the summer. Volunteers for redundancy will then have six months before they leave, while those forced to terminate their service early will be given a year.  Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said mass redundancies would be of ""deep concern"" across the country.  Mr Murphy said Labour agreed there was a need for cuts to the defence budget but warned the plans announced were ""wrong-headed and rushed"".  He said: ""Savings must be made and Britain will need to confront global threats with leaner, more advanced armed forces in future.  ""The most important baseline, however, is national security and we worry these cuts are wrong-headed and rushed. We need to know the full military impact of losing such important capability.""  In 2011 further reductions were identified for the regular Army, as the government sought to put greater emphasis on military reserves. Its total fighting force needs to drop from around 100,000 to 82,000 by 2020.  The current round of redundancies affects private soldiers through to the senior ranks - with some eight brigadiers and 60 lieutenant colonels being made redundant.  The navy will lose about five commodores, 17 captains and 19 Royal Marine officers. In the RAF, up to 15 air commodores and 30 group captains will be among the posts to be cut.  Military planners had already singled out the 3,500-strong Gurkha Brigade for job cuts, arguing they were overmanned.  The loss of about 400 Gurkha personnel announced on Tuesday follows an estimated 140 cuts to the brigade during the first wave of MoD cuts last year.  Major Tikendra Dal Dewan, chairman of the British Gurkha Welfare Society, said the news was saddening.  He said: ""What we don't understand is why we have lost around 140 men in the first tranche and now we are losing another 400 when we have just 3,500 but the infantry, which has tens of thousands [of personnel], are only losing 500 across the board.""  The Gurkhas, based at Shorncliffe in Kent, have been part of the British Army for more than half a century.  Following the partition of India in 1947, an agreement between Nepal, India and Britain meant four Gurkha regiments from the Indian Army were transferred to the British Army, eventually becoming the Gurkha Brigade.  The Royal Air Force is not seeking to make trainee pilots redundant, or to cut pilots at ranks below group captain level.  Both the Royal Navy and the RAF expect this to be their last round of redundancies, with natural wastage and a recruitment freeze in some areas making up for the rest."
636,"Rangers have been deducted 10 points after entering administration.  And it leaves the reigning champions 14 points behind Celtic in the race for the Scottish Premier League title.  An SPL statement said: ""As Rangers FC is subject to an insolvency event, a 10-point deduction has been applied to its total points in the league championship for the current season.  ""In addition, Rangers FC is subject to restrictions on the registration of players whilst in administration.""  The statement added that the SPL would be ""seeking an early meeting with the administrators"".  One item high on the agenda will be Rangers' ability to fulfil and host their next league game, at home to Kilmarnock on Saturday, although Strathclyde Police has expressed itself happy that it will be paid for policing the event.  ""We have had a positive meeting with the administrators and received assurances about payment for the provision of police services at this weekend's match,"" said a police statement.  ""We are working with the club and planning for the game as normal.  ""Strathclyde Police is a public body and has a duty to make sure public resources are used appropriately.""  Rangers, who are now nine points ahead of third-placed Motherwell having played a game more, also face a race to prove to the Scottish Football Association that their finances are in shape before 31 March or face expulsion from Europe next season.  Although there is no specific ban on clubs in administration playing in Europe, it would be very difficult for such a club to meet the other financial criteria needed for a licence.  Rangers owner Craig Whyte said: ""It remains our firm belief that the club's future can be secured and we hope this period of administration will be as short as possible.  ""As chairman and a Rangers fan, it is very painful to see the club being deducted 10 league points, but I would urge all Rangers supporters to rally round Ally McCoist and the team in these difficult times.""  Whyte placed the club in the hands of the administrators following a long-running tax dispute with HMRC that he claimed could cost the Glasgow club £75m.  However, it has emerged that Rangers were forced into administration over an unpaid tax bill of £9m - accrued since Whyte's takeover.  Duff and Phelps is now likely to cut costs at Ibrox and that could include job losses among the playing staff, although that process has been ongoing in recent years.  Rangers sold top goalscorer Nikica Jelavic to Everton for £5.5m last month, the Croatia striker being one of nine departures from manager Ally McCoist's playing squad for the rest of the season.  The Ibrox club added only Sweden Under-21 winger Mervan Celik during the transfer window and there is a question mark over whether a deal to sign free agent striker Daniel Cousin has been completed in time.  Rangers' move into administration has disappointed Scottish Football Association chief executive Stewart Regan said: ""I shall also be seeking a discussion with the appointed administrator in early course, to establish their intentions for the club given the wider implications for the Scottish game.  ""This is a profoundly sad chapter in the history of Scottish football and we should not underestimate the potential ramifications for the image of the game as a whole.  ""This season alone, we have had two of our biggest clubs, Rangers and Heart of Midlothian, experience serious financial uncertainty, with many other member clubs surviving hand-to-mouth in the current economic climate.  ""At a time when there is an appetite and momentum for radical change in Scottish football, it is important that we learn lessons from this dire situation and work together to provide a platform for clubs to thrive and prosper within their means."""

""I'm as prepared as I can be, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to do everything that I did before,"" the 38-year-old said in an interview broadcast on Sky One on Sunday.

638,"Scientists have found further evidence that dolphins call each other by ""name"".  Research has revealed that the marine mammals use a unique whistle to identify each other.  A team from the University of St Andrews in Scotland found that when the animals hear their own call played back to them, they respond.  The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Dr Vincent Janik, from the university's Sea Mammal Research Unit, said: ""(Dolphins) live in this three-dimensional environment, offshore without any kind of landmarks and they need to stay together as a group.  ""These animals live in an environment where they need a very efficient system to stay in touch.""  It had been-long suspected that dolphins use distinctive whistles in much the same way that humans use names.  Previous research found that these calls were used frequently, and dolphins in the same groups were able to learn and copy the unusual sounds.  But this is the first time that the animals response to being addressed by their ""name"" has been studied.  To investigate, researchers recorded a group of wild bottlenose dolphins, capturing each animal's signature sound.  They then played these calls back using underwater speakers.  ""We played signature whistles of animals in the group, we also played other whistles in their repertoire and then signature whistles of different populations - animals they had never seen in their lives,"" explained Dr Janik.  The researchers found that individuals only responded to their own calls, by sounding their whistle back.  The team believes the dolphins are acting like humans: when they hear their name, they answer.  Dr Janik said this skill probably came about to help the animals to stick together in a group in their vast underwater habitat.  He said: ""Most of the time they can't see each other, they can't use smell underwater, which is a very important sense in mammals for recognition, and they also don't tend to hang out in one spot, so they don't have nests or burrows that they return to.""  The researchers believe this is the first time this has been seen in an animal, although other studies have suggested some species of parrot may use sounds to label others in their group.  Dr Janik said that understanding how this skill evolved in parallel in very different groups of animals could tell us more about how communication developed in humans."
639,"Mustafa Kamal has quit as International Cricket Council president and accused the body of acting ""unlawfully"".  Kamal said his decision came after he was denied the right to present the trophy to winners Australia after Sunday's World Cup final in Melbourne.  Instead, it was presented by Indian ICC chairman Narayanaswami Srinivasan.  Kamal, a Bangladesh national, had previously criticised the umpiring at the competition after his country's quarter-final defeat by India.  He said Bangladesh's 109-run loss appeared to have been ""pre-arranged"" and there was ""no quality in the umpiring"" - a claim denied by the ICC.  ""The main reason for my resignation is that I can't work with those who can act unconstitutionally and unlawfully,"" Kamal said on Wednesday.  ""These type of people should be away from cricket, otherwise cricket will be spoilt, cricket will not move forward.  ""I'm sure people will find out why I have resigned and they will unearth the truth - who are these people, what are they doing, and how they are running ICC.""  The ICC later confirmed Kamal had tendered his resignation, but said his letter contained ""no complaints"" against anyone in the organisation.  ""Mr Kamal said he was stepping down on personal grounds and offered his apologies to all associated with the ICC,"" a statement said.  The ICC president has become a largely honorary position since changes to the ICC constitution in 2014 handed control to the so-called 'Big Three' nations of England, India and Australia.  The ICC Board will consider the vacant position at its meeting in Dubai on 15 and 16 April."
640,"Margo MacDonald has been formally expelled from the Scottish National Party following her decision to stand as an independent candidate in May's Holyrood elections.  Ms MacDonald said she had recently renewed her membership and that she would be looking for a rebate if party bosses threw her out.  Now the SNP has written to her saying it considered her decision as a ""public resignation"".  The outspoken MSP confirmed her intention to stand as an independent on the Lothians regional list on Tuesday.  At a media conference in Edinburgh she said she had no plans to quit the SNP even though she will be competing with it.  She said: ""I paid my membership last month, so I'll be looking for a rebate if they throw me out.  ""I used to be deputy leader of the SNP and in those days we used to try people before they were expelled from the party.""  In June last year Ms MacDonald was effectively deselected when her placing on a list of top-up candidates for Lothian slipped from first to fifth, dashing her hopes of re-election.  The following month she said she would not be standing as an SNP candidate, but that she had not decided whether she would become an independent.  But she said she had now received ""astonishing levels of support"" from ordinary voters urging her to go it alone.  She said: ""I have been impressed by the number of voters in Lothian who have said 'yes, go for it, because we don't think all that much about the way the parliament is operating just now'.""  Ms MacDonald, a former barmaid and PE teacher, said that as an independent she would be freer to reflect voters' opinions.  She denied being ""traitorous"" by standing against the party for which she had a stunning by-election win in Govan 30 years ago.  ""I think the parties have to be far more responsive to public opinion,"" she said.  ""It's no longer enough for a party to take a line and then stick to it.  ""I think we could do with some independents in the Scottish Parliament just to make it a better place.""  Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's deputy leader, insisted Ms MacDonald's exit would not affect the party's election chances.  And she said that if the result of the last election was repeated, Green MSP Robin Harper would lose his seat if Ms MacDonald was elected.  Ms Cunningham said: ""Ms MacDonald says she wants more independent voices in the parliament but the reality is that her candidacy is likely to destroy any hopes that Robin Harper might have of returning as an MSP after the election.  ""What this shows is that Ms MacDonald's decision to leave the SNP, despite being selected as an SNP candidate, can only be seen as a result of her disappointment at the result for the election for list places.""  Announcing her decision Ms MacDonald said: ""I've always put people before party. As such, I'm out of step with the party control freakery which is all too evident in the executive coalition and the SNP.""  Alex Neil MSP, a long-time ally on the left of the party, said he believed more could have been done to keep her on board.  He said: ""I think that every party and every political system should be big enough to accept that you will get people who have a particular individual contribution to make.  ""We should be able to accommodate that within parties and within the general political system.""  He added: ""I think it is a loss for the party and I'm sorry that it's come to this."""

They also stress he has opted for a less gas-guzzling car.  Labour's Stephen Hepburn told the Daily Mirror it was ""hypocrisy"" showed he was ""conning people about the environment"".  The environment has been high on the Tory agenda ahead of next week's local elections, with the party using the slogan ""vote blue, go green"".  Mr Cameron has been much-photographed cycling to Parliament on his mountain bike and plans to install a wind turbine in his home.  He has also said people need to walk or cycle on shorter journeys if they are serious about tackling climate change. But the Daily Mirror newspaper has published photographs of the MP's driver taking his shoes and briefcase in a car following him to work.  Steven Hounsham, from campaign group Transport 2000, said: ""It's unbelievable. If there's a good reason for making a car journey to transport shoes, a case and a shirt, then I'd like to hear it.""  A spokeswoman for the Tory leader was relaxed about people knowing about Mr Cameron's car following his bike.  ""We've never made any secret of it,"" she said. ""David has always enjoyed cycling and if he could carry all of the boxes of documents for work on his bike, then he would.  ""But he has changed his car for one that has lower carbon emissions and has also made other personal changes to help the environment, such as making his new home more energy-efficient and changing his electricity supply to renewable energy.""  Mr Cameron has swapped his government-provided Vauxhall Omega - with emissions of 276g per kilometre - for a commercially-leased Lexus with a hybrid engine giving off 186g.  But critics say he should have taken a Toyota Prius, which emits 104g per kilometre.  Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Chris Huhne said Mr Cameron's behaviour made a nonsense of his commitment to cycling as the greenest way to get to work.  ""If everyone with green leanings now needs a shoe chauffeur the environment will be ruined,"" he said.  ""As a matter of urgency, I will personally buy and deliver to Mr Cameron a pannier for him to put over his back wheels so that he can cycle to work while leaving his shoe chauffeur at home.""  Mr Cameron is focusing on local issues in his constituency on Friday. Shadow foreign secretary William Hague and shadow chancellor George Osborne are out on the national campaign trail.  Mr Hague is visiting a regeneration project in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire while Mr Osborne is campaigning in Birmingham."
642,"When Sourav Ganguly was dropped from India's team two years ago following a public spat with coach Greg Chappell, his international career looked over.  On Thursday, however, he will crown a remarkable comeback when he plays against England at Lord's, the ground on which he made his Test debut 11 years ago.  Prominent Indian cricketers are figures of fervent fascination in their homeland, but the fluctuating fortunes of Ganguly's career have captured more attention than most.  India's longest-serving Test captain, with 21 victories from 49 matches, he now has to settle for an occasional word of advice when invited to offer one by successor Rahul Dravid  But even that represents a victory of sorts after what happened in 2005 when an e-mail from Chappell to India's Board of Control [BCCI], in which he criticised Ganguly, was made public.  In it, he reportedly said Ganguly was no longer ""physically or mentally fit"" to be captain.  Ganguly wasted no time in enlisting support from the Indian media and eventually the board had to intervene and order a truce between the pair.  Despite Chappell's claim that their differences had been ""exaggerated"", it was not long before Ganguly found himself out of the team.  ""The row with Greg Chappell just added to the mystery, but he was going through a really bad patch then, his only score [of note] was a hundred against Zimbabwe and that didn't count for much,"" said Chandresh Narayanan, chief cricket correspondent of the Times of India.  Narayanan has followed Ganguly's career closely and acknowledges that his sometimes aloof attitude, which has seen him given the soubriquet 'Lord Snooty', has not done him any favours.  Ganguly has always had a well developed sense of his own worth.  ""In 1991-2 when he toured Australia as an 18-year-old, he was the baby of the squad.  ""But even at that age Sourav earned the reputation of being an arrogant guy and some sources said he refused to carry drinks out, saying it was not his job.  ""So all that went against him and he was out in the wilderness,"" Narayanan told BBC Sport.  Ganguly was punished by being left out of the team for four years.  And even when he was recalled for the 1996 tour to England, there was speculation that it owed much to the influence of then board treasurer Jagmohan Dalmiya, who also hails from Calcutta.  ""It was claimed his place was guaranteed because certain officials from his zone played a huge part in the selection of the India team,"" Narayanan explained.  ""But he proved everybody wrong, he got a century at Lord's and another one at Trent Bridge and became India's best batsman along with Tendulkar.""  For the next nine years, Ganguly was a near ever present and became India's longest serving and most successful Test captain, with 21 victories from 49 matches.  ""As a captain he added steel to the team, rallied them, he was like an action hero from the Hollywood movies,"" said Narayanan.  But following a drawn three-Test series with Pakistan early in 2005, in which he made only 48 runs, things came to a head in Zimbabwe and led to him being relieved of the captaincy which passed to Dravid, his former deputy.  Ganguly could simply have walked away - but such is his pride that he refused to accept his fate and focused on finding a way back into the team.  He was helped by youngsters like Suresh Raina failing to make the most of opportunities given to them and in late 2006 he was recalled after an absence of 41 one-day internationals and seven Tests.  ""The Indian team was going through a bad phase and they had to turn to Sourav, who proved his worth,"" said Narayanan.  Ganguly made an unbeaten half century in his first Test innings back in the team in South Africa, added another fifty in the same series and recorded his 13th Test century against Bangladesh in Chittagong.  And so, with Chappell now out of the picture, Ganguly's career will come full circle when he returns to Lord's.  If he can repeat the hundred he made in 1996, no-one will be more pleased than Dravid, who also made his first Test appearance in that same match.  ""These two guys have played together since junior cricket and have been through thick and thin. They have changed the face of Indian cricket,"" Narayanan added."
643,"Scenario one: The status quo Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 50 years. Currently a boundary - the Line of Control - divides the region in two, with one part administered by India and one by Pakistan. India would like to formalise this status quo and make it the accepted international boundary. But Pakistan and Kashmiri activists reject this plan because they both want greater control over the region.  In 1947-8 India and Pakistan fought their first war over Jammu and Kashmir. Under United Nations' supervision, they agreed to a ceasefire along a line which left one-third of the state - comprising what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern Areas administered by Pakistan and two-thirds, Jammu, Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley, administered by India.  In 1972, under the terms of the Simla agreement, the ceasefire line was renamed the Line of Control.  Although India claims that the entire state is part of India, it has been prepared to accept the Line of Control as the international border, with some possible modifications. Both the US and the UK have also favoured turning the Line of Control into an internationally-recognised frontier.  But Pakistan has consistently refused to accept the Line of Control as the border since the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley would remain as part of India. Formalising the status quo also does not take account of the aspirations of those Kashmiris who have been fighting since 1989 for independence for the whole or part of the state."
644,"A Dutch court has sentenced the two owners of a fireworks factory to six months for illegally storing fireworks that exploded and killed 20 people in the town of Enschede on 12 May 2000.  Rudi Bakker and Wilhelm Pater were freed after the decision was announced since they had already spent three months in remand and each had three months of their sentences suspended.  The presiding judge, Hans Breitbarth, harshly condemned Enschede authorities for failing to prevent the country's worst fireworks disaster, saying they shared the blame. An entire city block was destroyed and hundreds of locals injured in the blast, which happened when several storage containers at the depot caught fire, triggering a series of powerful explosions. Bakker and Pater were each fined 2,250 euros ($2,540) for violating safety regulations. The men were found guilty of importing and selling illegal fireworks, breaking safety codes and violating storage licenses. Prosecutors had demanded sentences of between 15 and 30 months, but the pair were both acquitted of the more serious charges of negligence for the fire.  After the decision Bakker and Pater both walked away from the court, in the town of Almelo, just a few kilometres from Enschede. Enschede was built around the SE Fireworks factory, the only one in the Netherlands to be located in a residential area. The force of the explosion, in which four fire fighters were killed, was heard in nearby towns. It left a swathe of damage in Enschede, blowing out windows, setting on fire nearby buildings and enveloping the city in clouds of smoke. Most people - including the mayor Jan Mans - were unaware that the SE Fireworks warehouse was even there. Fire fighters at first believed they were attending a routine fire, then 100 tons of explosives ignited, sending fireballs into the air. When it was built in 1977, the warehouse was outside the town, but as new residential areas were built it became surrounded by low-income housing."
645,"It was after midnight on Saturday, 5 April, 1986 when a bomb exploded in West Berlin's La Belle disco, killing two US servicemen and a Turkish woman.  It took the US government 10 days to retaliate for the attack by bombing Libya - it took 15 years and the fall of the Berlin Wall to convict the attackers.  Many were there on the night that a two-kilogram bomb packed with plastic explosives and shrapnel exploded close to the dance-floor and ripped through the club at 0140.  Sergeant Kenneth Ford, 21, and 29-year-old Nermin Hannay died at the scene. Sergeant James Goins, 25, would die later in hospital.  Another 229 people were wounded, including 79 Americans. Some were badly maimed by shrapnel, many suffered burst eardrums.  Ronald Reagan was US president at the time, and he blamed Libya for the explosion.  Intercepted messages between Tripoli and agents in Europe made it clear that Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi was the brains behind the attack, the US said.  The operation was widely seen as an attempt to kill Colonel Gaddafi. He survived, but his adopted baby daughter was killed in the bombing along with at least 15 civilians.  It was not the first time that Libya and the US had clashed in recent years - even before the La Belle bombing tensions between the two countries were at an all-time high.  Prosecutors would later argue that Libya had ordered the attack on the Berlin disco to avenge the sinking of two patrol boats by the US in the Gulf of Sirte in March 1986.  In spite of reports blaming Libya for the attack on the nightclub, the trail went cold until the 1990 reunification of Germany and the subsequent opening up of the East's secret service archives.  Eter was persuaded to give evidence, but he remained a defendant because he only gave limited co-operation, according to the prosecution.  The Stasi files listed him as an agent, and prosecutors said he was the Libyan spy agency's main contact at the embassy.  Eter and four other suspects were arrested in 1996 in Lebanon, Italy, Greece and Berlin, and put on trial a year later.  After a four-year trial, often described as murky, Musbah Eter was finally sentenced to 12 years in prison for aiding and abetting attempted murder.  Two other Libyan embassy workers also received convictions for attempted murder: Palestinian Yasser Shraydi, accused of being the ringleader, and the Lebanese-born German, Ali Chanaa, who doubled as a Stasi agent.  Chanaa's German wife, Verena, was the only defendant found guilty of murder, after the prosecution showed she had planted the bomb. She was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment.  Prosecutors said the three men had assembled the bomb in the Chanaas' flat. The explosive was said to have been brought into West Berlin in a Libyan diplomatic bag.  Verena Chanaa and her sister, Andrea Haeusler, carried it into the La Belle in a travel bag and left five minutes before it exploded.  Ms Haeusler was acquitted because it could not be proved that she knew a bomb was in the bag.  Against the other four, the evidence cited included intercepted radio transmissions from Tripoli to the embassy in East Berlin, surveillance records on Eter and Shraydi and reports on the Libyan embassy's activities compiled by Chanaa.  There were also receipts for money allegedly paid to the Chanaas for the attack on La Belle, secretly photocopied by the Stasi.  But the prosecution was unable to prove that Colonel Gaddafi was behind the attack - a failure which the court blamed on the ""limited willingness"" of the German and US governments to share intelligence."
646,"Walden has been in superb form in China Qualifier Ricky Walden stunned world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan 10-8 to win the Shanghai Masters in China. World number one O'Sullivan looked on course for his 22nd ranking title and a record-equalling third title in a row. But his fellow Englishman fought back, winning five of the last seven frames and clinching his first ranking title at the age of 25 with a break of 105. ""I'm now going to go to Las Vegas with my friends and really enjoy it,"" said Chester-born world number 35 Walden. ""I am thrilled to bits to win my first tournament. I had a bit of luck, especially when I missed a few easy chances, but I managed to stay calm and I hope I can go on and achieve more now."" I never put him under any pressure so I deserved to lose    Walden's impressive win moved him up to 17th in the latest rankings and on the verge of a coveted top-16 place. ""I certainly want to get into that top 16 and win more tournaments,"" said Flintshire-based Walden, who beat Stephen Hendry, Neil Robertson, Steve Davis and Mark Selby on his way to the final. The defeat also ended O'Sullivan's hopes of becoming the first professional player for 15 years to win three consecutive ranking titles. ""Ricky played very well. He's a good player and it's good that he has won an event,"" he said. Walden is no mug and deserves his win    ""I never put him under any pressure so I deserved to lose. I have still had a good week to get to the final."" Only Scotland's Stephen Hendry, Welshman Ray Reardon and fellow Englishman Steve Davis have ever won three rankings events in a row."
647,"A painting that may be by the Italian master Caravaggio and worth £94m ($135m) has been found in the loft of a house in southern France.  It was found in Toulouse two years ago and passed to art expert Eric Turquin, who says it is a version of the 1599 work, Judith Beheading Holofernes.  He said it was discovered by the owners when they investigated a roof leak.  The French government has placed a bar on the work leaving the country for 30 months while tests are carried out.  The work, which depicts the Biblical heroine Judith beheading an Assyrian general, is thought to have gone missing about 100 years after it was painted.  Another version of it, which was also thought to be lost before its rediscovery in 1950, hangs in Rome's National Gallery of Ancient Art.  Experts at Paris' Louvre Museum are examining the work to try to establish its creator, though Turquin said there would ""never be a consensus"" on who painted it.  If it proves to be genuine, the French Government will be given the first chance to purchase the work."
648,"More than 700 contributors were involved in creating the dictionary The biggest work ever published about the lives of famous Irish men and women has been launched in Belfast by poet Seamus Heaney. The nine-volume Dictionary of Irish Biography features more than 9,700 entries and spans 2,000 years of the island's history. Described by Mr Heaney as ""an epoch-making event in the history of Irish scholarship"", it is a joint project between the Royal Irish Academy and Cambridge University Press. Alongside Northern Ireland luminaries from Joey Dunlop to CS Lewis, the historians and writers have profiled some of the more unusual figures from the past. Here are some abridged versions of just few of them. James Gamble, the Gamble in Procter and Gamble Typhoid Mary has become a generic term for a healthy carrier of a dangerous disease, but the name originated with a woman born in Cookstown, County Tyrone. Mary Mallon emigrated to New York at the age of 14, and 10 years later began work as a domestic cook for wealthy families. In August 1906, she was employed in the Long Island summer residence of a New York banker when six members of the household fell ill with typhoid fever. At that time the disease afflicted several thousand New Yorkers annually and had a 10% fatality rate. A doctor who was treating the family pursued the idea that a healthy person carrying the disease might have infected the victims. Seamus Heaney paid tribute to the scholarship involved in creating the dictionary He worked out that typhoid fever had affected seven households in which Mary had worked from 1900, infecting 22 people and claiming one life. After rebuffing subsequent approaches by the doctor, and chasing him with a carving knife on one occasion, she was forcibly apprehended by police and detained in hospital, where tests confirmed she was a carrier of the disease. She was taken to an isolation hospital on North Brother island in the East River where she lived in a one-room cottage while undergoing a series of ineffective treatments. In June 1909, she came dramatically to public attention through a feature story in William Randolph Hearst's New York American. Journalists, led by the initial American story, came up with the nickname 'Typhoid Mary'. In February 1910 she was released from quarantine after agreeing by affidavit to change occupation and take ""consistent hygienic precautions"". She was given work in a New York laundry, but resented the lower wages and status of the job and returned to work as a cook in September 1912. In 1915 she was discovered working under an alias as a cook at Sloane maternity hospital, location of a recent outbreak of 25 typhoid cases among staff, including two deaths. Amid huge public indignation, fuelled by a universally hostile press accusing her of a deliberate and callous violation of trust while endangering innocents, Mallon was returned to hospital for the remaining 23 years of her life. Manufacturing giant Procter and Gamble has been a household name for decades, but it is perhaps less well-known that the titular Gamble has its origins in County Fermanagh. James Gamble was educated at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen before he moved with his family to the US at the age of 16. Although they were related to prosperous farmers, merchants and linen bleachers, it is thought business difficulties may have led his father to decide to emigrate. They set sail from the port of Derry and after 47 days reached New Brunswick in Canada. After this they embarked on a further gruelling journey by boat and wagon with the intention of settling in Illinois, but James became seriously ill in Cincinnati. The family settled there and after his recovery, James began an apprenticeship as a soap-maker. He set up his own soap business in 1828/29, and it was in 1837 that he began the partnership that would eventually be known around the world. William Procter was an English-born candlemaker, and the two men met while courting two sisters, Elizabeth and Olivia Norris, who had recently immigrated from Belfast. Their father Alexander Norris is credited with spotting the potential of the two men's businesses - both soap and candles used the same raw materials, notably tallow and other animal oils, which were in plentiful supply in Cincinnati thanks to the thriving meat-packing industry in the area. The rapidly expanding railway network helped Messrs Procter and Gamble to improve their business, and in 1859 sales exceeded $1m. The advent of the American Civil War provided a further boost for the company, which equipped the union armies with soap and candles. In 1879, they began the manufacture of ivory soap, which became one of their most important products. James and Elizabeth Gamble had seven sons and three daughters. While James died in 1891 and Elizabeth in 1888, the family continued to oversee great expansion and diversification in the years that followed. Known as the ""Carnmoney Witch"", she was born in Carrickfergus near the scene of an infamous witch trial in Islandmagee the previous century. At an early age she became a practitioner of ""white"" magic, using herbal and superstitious remedies to cure various ailments. Her specialised area was curing cows that were suspected of being bewitched. Because of the importance of cows in Irish agriculture, their vulnerability to witchcraft was feared: it was believed that malevolent 'butterwitches' could cast spells on cows to prevent it being possible to churn butter out of their milk. One Tuesday evening in August 1807, she was called to Carnmoney by a family called Montgomery to advise on a cow believed to have been bewitched by some Carrickfergus women. First, she attempted to churn some butter with the milk but was unable to, and some people who drank the milk vomited. At ten o'clock she sent Alexander Montgomery and a young man called Carnaghan out to the cow-house and ordered them to turn their waistcoats inside out and stand by the head of the cow until called back inside. She remained in the house with Mr Montgomery's wife Elizabeth, their son David and an elderly woman called Margaret Lee. There she applied some traditional witchcraft cures, including putting pins and needles in a pot of sweet milk on the fire. The house was sealed, with all exits blocked, so that the smoke would cleanse the enchantment. At daybreak, having heard no word, Mr Montgomery went to the house to investigate. Breaking in the door, he found all four of them lying on the floor. Elizabeth and David were dead, while Mary Butters and Ms Lee barely breathing. Ms Lee died a few minutes later, but Ms Butters recovered after being thrown on a dung-heap, and kicked repeatedly by the furious husband. At an inquest, the jury decided that death had resulted from suffocation, caused by a sulphurous brew Ms Butters had prepared to cure the sick cow. Butters was brought before the spring assizes in 1808 but the charges against her were dismissed by proclamation. She claimed the devil had appeared in the house and had attacked the inhabitants with a large club. Perhaps unusually, the story created no fear or hostility in the area, and the ""Carnmoney witch"" did not suffer from her involvement in the episode. Ms Butters continued to practice her arts for a number of decades, with locals still coming to her to cure bewitched cows. She was also popular with victims of horse-theft: people believed that once she was told the name of the person responsible, she could concoct some arcane punishment. The witchcraft act was repealed in 1821. Although he grew up to be a fairground performer dubbed the ""world's tallest man"", there was nothing exceptional about his physique as a child in Killowen, County Down. At the age of 17, after the loss of the family farm, he found work on the Liverpool docks where his height and weight made him stand out as a labourer. It is said that he was contracted to do two men's work for double wages. His increasing size astonished people in Warrenpoint, when he returned after a year or so to stay with his widowed mother. By his early 20s he had grown to over 8 ft (2.44 m) in height. Sources vary in estimating his height, with accounts ranging from 8ft 10in (2.69 m) to 8ft 1in (2.46 m), although the latter figure from the parish register is believed most likely. This perhaps made him the tallest man in the world at that time and one of the tallest ever. One of the interesting features of his case is that he was said to have maintained body proportion and strength as he grew. His personality was universally considered pleasant and even-tempered. He amused children in Rostrevor by lighting his pipe off the village gas lamps. In one of the few displays of anger recorded of him in folklore, he hoisted two bickering football players into the air with both arms and knocked their heads together to bring order to a match. It seems that he showed some initial distaste for exhibiting his person to the curious for money, but at some point in the mid 1850s he was paid to make appearances in a Liverpool public house. Later he went on a short European tour with an exhibition of curiosities, doing sufficiently well to purchase a small farm in Kilbroney, near Rostrevor, County Down. Evicted some years later, he resumed work in Europe as an attraction in a travelling circus and reportedly moved in aristocratic circles in France. He died in Marseilles, of smallpox caught while on tour in the south of France. Friends brought his embalmed body back to Ireland, and he was interred in Kilbroney cemetery on 18 June 1862. The Dictionary of Irish Biography costs £650 if purchased before 31 January. An online version of the dictionary will be an ongoing project, with new biographies being added twice a year.     "
649,"Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed while trying to stop an Israeli army bulldozer demolish a Palestinian home in the Gaza Strip in 2003, was a committed peace activist.  She was a student at Evergreen State College in her local town of Olympia in Washington State, which is known for its liberal sensibilities.  The 23-year-old arranged peace events there before joining, through local group Olympians for Peace and Solidarity, a Palestinian-led organisation that uses non-violent means to challenge Israeli army tactics in the West Bank and Gaza.  Speaking after she died in hospital on 17 March 2003 - two years before Israeli troops and settlers left Gaza - her parents paid tribute to her concern for human rights and dignity, remembering how she was ""dedicated to everybody"".  ""Rachel was filled with a love and sense of duty to our fellow man, wherever they lived, and she gave her life trying to protect those that could not protect themselves,"" her father Craig said.  Corrie's mother Cindy said her daughter had spent nights sleeping at wells to protect them from bulldozers.  ""She lived with families whose houses were threatened with demolition and today as we understand it, she stood for three hours trying to protect a house.""  Corrie had been with some eight other activists from the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement (ISM) acting as human shields in an effort to stop the demolition in the Rafah refugee camp.  The Israeli authorities said at the time that demolitions were necessary because Palestinian gunmen used the structures as cover to shoot at their troops patrolling in the area, or to conceal arms-smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.  Corrie - who was wearing an orange fluorescent jacket to alert the bulldozer drivers to her presence - had previously described the hazards of her work.  An email distributed by the ISM detailed a confrontation on 14 February between another bulldozer and her own group, which she refers to as the ""internationals"".  ""The internationals stood in the path of the bulldozer and were physically pushed with the shovel backwards, taking shelter in a house,"" she wrote. ""The bulldozer then proceeded on its course, demolishing one side of the house with the internationals inside.""  Witnesses said that on the day she died, Corrie had climbed on top of a pile of earth which lay in the path of a bulldozer.  ""The bulldozer went towards her very slowly. She was fully in clear view, straight in front of them,"" fellow activist Tom Dale said.  ""Unfortunately she couldn't keep her grip there and she started to slip down. You could see she was in serious trouble; there was panic in her face as she was turning around.""  ""All the activists there were screaming, running towards the bulldozer, trying to get them to stop. But they just kept on going,"" he added.  Richard Purssell, another activist, said: ""The driver didn't slow down; he just ran over her. Then he reversed the bulldozer back over her again.""  However, an internal investigation led by the Israeli military's chief of staff concluded within a month of Corrie's death that its forces were not to blame, that she had been hidden behind a mound of earth and the bulldozer driver had not seen her.  ""Rachel Corrie was not run over by an engineering vehicle but rather was struck by a hard object, most probably a slab of concrete which was moved or slid down while the mound of earth which she was standing behind was moved,"" it said.  While the investigators expressed sorrow for any incident in which innocent people were harmed, they felt that the ""illegal and irresponsible"" actions of the ISM ""contributed to the tragic and distressing results"".  Corrie's parents refused to accept the findings and maintained that the military's investigation had not been ""thorough, credible and transparent"", as then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had promised.  In March 2010, the family filed a civil suit in the Haifa district court against the Israeli government over the incident, accusing the military of either unlawfully or intentionally killing her or of gross negligence. The family described it as their ""absolutely last resort"".  Craig Corrie said he still believed his daughter had been seen by the driver of the bulldozer, and that the order to use bulldozers should never have been given while non-combatants were in the area.  But on 28 August, Judge Oded Gershon dismissed the civil lawsuit, ruling that Corrie's death was a ""regrettable accident"" that had been not caused by the negligence of the Israeli state or army.  He also found that there had been no fault in the internal Israeli military investigation, which cleared the driver of the bulldozer of any blame. The judge said the driver had not seen the American activist, who he said could have saved herself.  ""She did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done,"" he added. ""She consciously put herself in danger.""  He ruled that there was no justification to demand the state pay any damages, but said the Corrie family would not have to pay costs.  Afterwards, Cindy Corrie said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the verdict and that the family intended to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court.  ""I believe that this was a bad day not only for our family but a bad day for human rights, for humanity, for the rule of law and also for the country of Israel,"" she told a news conference.  ""From the beginning it was clear to us that there was a process of investigation, operational investigations, military police investigations, and it was confirmed to us today that that extends through the court system in Israel - a well-heeled system to protect the Israeli military, the soldiers who conduct actions in that military, to provide them with impunity at the cost of all the civilians who are impacted by what they do."""
650,"THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE Wigan's sculptures of Snow White and the dwarves You may not be able to see it, but this is the work of a world-famous sculptor, who creates pieces so small they are almost invisible to the naked eye. After years of developing his technique, Willard Wigan chats with Inside Out about his love for all things miniature. It's not every day you visit an art gallery only to find the exhibition is visible only through the lens of a microscope, but art enthusiasts visiting Birmingham's The Artlounge are set to be very surprised. In an exhibition by world-renowned microsculptor Willard Wigan, tiny sculptures no bigger than a pinhead are on display underneath gleaming perspex domes, set on a plinth with high-powered microscopes to bring them into focus to the naked eye. Willard uses a microscope to go about his intricate work Among the pieces on display are reproductions of landmarks such as Tower Bridge, and scenes of Jesus Christ and The Last Supper, with each individual figure no bigger than an eyelash or a human hair. At less than a hundredth of an inch tall, it's painstakingly precise work. Willard has been developing his technique for 40 years and has sculpted pieces from gold, carbon fibre, nylon and even a grain of sand. He says it takes approximately one to two months working in total solitude at his studio in Jersey to complete an individual piece. ""The stillness of it is very important - you have to control the whole nervous system, you have to work between the heartbeat - the pulse of your finger can destroy the work,"" explains Willard. ""That's when the real concentration has to come out - mind, body and soul has to give in order to do this."" Willard's inspiration came from his childhood obsession Willard's fascination with all things miniature began in his schooldays, when he developed an interest in the smaller things in life. He says, ""Call me eccentric, I suppose, but when I was little I had a fascination for ants so I set about making houses for them. I got obsessed with miniature things."" It's obviously paid off - Willard is now one of the world's most revered micro-miniaturists, with some of his pieces selling for upwards of £15,000. Veejay Lingiah, Managing Director of The Artlounge, said, ""I think one of the beauties of Willard's work is that it crosses all cultural boundaries. ""No matter what language you speak or where you're from, you can't help but be amazed by his work"" ""You have to control the whole nervous system, you have to work between the heartbeat - the pulse of your finger can destroy the work."" But Willard's work is not without its sceptics. He says, ""A lot of people look at it and think 'is it a trick?' ""You get them checking the microscopes to see if there is any illusion. To me that's a compliment."" It may be a compliment to the artist, but his work is no illusion, and we've got the proof. Microsurgeon Dr Bartley McNeela gave one of Willard's prized pieces, a delicately-carved African elephant on the head of a pin, the professional once-over. ""It is very impressive work. I don't know if I even get to that level in my job! It's very impressive indeed."" And it looks like the buyers are happy, with one satisfied customer saying, ""If you try to tell someone that this guy's done the Last Supper through the eye of a needle people just look at me like I'm crazy. ""I thought 'I've just got to have one of these pieces.' What I'm going to do with it I don't know - I'm afraid to drop it, that's all I can say, I'd never find it again!""

651,"The famed publishers of romantic fiction, Mills and Boon, launched in India recently.  The company hopes that its amorous storylines will eventually seduce the country and become their biggest market.  So what does an all-female reading group in Delhi think of romantic novels where the dark and brooding hero almost invariably ends up wooing and winning the fair maiden?  The women of a reading group I met at a cafe in the capital have a common passion for romance.  For Seema Monhot, the main appeal is the ""feel good factor"" of a romantic novel.  ""I like happy endings,"" she said.  ""Romance, for a girl, is an ongoing thing until the day you die. It doesn't matter what age you are, you still want every bit of the romance that you experienced the first time you met your boyfriend, fiancé, or loved one. That's the way I look at it.""  Although Mills and Boon - which has nearly three-quarters of the romantic market in its home country of the UK - is only now launching in India, their books are already popular in the country because they have been unofficially introduced from abroad.  Many in the reading group describe themselves as long-time readers.  Rachana Srivastava, for example, says that she grew up on a ""staple diet"" of the publisher's works, which have moulded her perception of the ideal man.  ""I always imagined a knight in shining armour having vineyards and being tall, dark and handsome, coming and waking me up in my sleep and carrying me away somewhere,"" she said.  ""It has always been like that for me.""  I ask the women in the group who their ideal Indian romantic hero man would be.  They say he should be a combination of Bollywood actors Hrithik Roshan and Shahrukh Khan, businessman Anil Ambani and industrialist Sunil Mittal.  Interestingly, these are all modern Indian men - the women are not looking for age-old Maharajahs.  ""Contemporary India likes contemporary men, men who are self-made and not of inherited wealth,"" says Savita Jain.  ""That makes them more interesting.""  Her friend chips in that this dream man would be ""tall, dark, handsome, rich and have a private jet"".  The women tell me that in real life, men have flaws as well as their plus points - but one of the joys of the men in romantic fiction is that these flaws do not exist.  Unfortunately perhaps for real Indian men, the women say that the plots of the novels have sometimes influenced their choices in real life.  ""When you read the books, you relive those moments with your beloved when you meet them,"" says Savita Jain.  ""What I feel is that these are just fiction stories. When you are reading them you are happy with them, but you don't actually come across such heroes in your life,"" adds Kiran Chaudari.  ""It's very hard to get an ideal partner for yourself. Reading a Mills and Boon, you tend to fantasise - and you do get disheartened.""  Indeed, this is one criticism frequently levelled at Mills and Boon - the sheer lack of realism, both in character and in plot.  But for another of the group, Meenakshi Jain, realism is the last thing she wants.  ""The world we are living in, it is so tense,"" she says.  ""This kind of book gives you respite from these tensions. You can fantasise yourself into the place of the heroine."""
652,"New runways at Heathrow and Gatwick are among the options that have been short-listed by the Airports Commission for expanding UK airport capacity.  The three short-listed options include adding a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow, and a new runway at Gatwick.  The commission, led by businessman Sir Howard Davies, will also consider a new airport in the Isle of Grain in north Kent.  The commission has not shortlisted proposals for expanding Stansted or Birmingham, but said there was likely to be a case for considering them as ""potential options"" for any second new runway by 2050.  Sir Howard was asked in 2012 to investigate the options for expanding the UK's aviation capacity and try to come up with a plan.  He said the Commission's analysis showed one net additional runway was needed by 2030.  ""The capacity challenge is not yet critical, but it will become so if no action is taken soon,"" he added.  There are four interesting elements of today's report. It hasn't written off the ambitious, expensive idea of building a new mega-airport on the other side of London in the Thames Estuary. It misses off Stansted, despite it being picked for expansion by the last government. Stansted lost a lot of passengers in the recession. It also suggests that we might not need one huge hub airport after all, because all the growth in recent years has come from low-cost carriers. In a nutshell, it makes the case stronger for a bigger Gatwick. When I first took over the transport job, about two years ago, the government told me straight away that it would not expand Heathrow. One of the first things the coalition did when it came to power was to cancel Labour plans for a third runway at the airport. I've gone through my old notebooks and found this phrase written down, ""dead and buried"". But after a great deal of lobbying from the airport's owners, other business leaders, airlines and the unions, as well as support from the Transport Select Committee, Heathrow is emerging once again, as a front-runner in the fight to get a new runway. Sir Howard has set a deadline of 2030. But believe me, there are plenty in the industry - like Willie Walsh at British Airways, for example - who still don't think that in the end, anything will actually ever get built.  The Commission has short-listed the following proposals to investigate ahead of its final report:  The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has said that putting a new runway at Heathrow would be a ""catastrophe"".  Following the commission's report, Mr Johnson said he continued to support the creation of the Isle of Grain airport in north Kent.  ""A new airport in the inner estuary is the only credible hub option left. By keeping it on the table, Davies is saying you have a choice - between a damaging U-turn or a radical new vision for expansion,"" he said.  In its report, the Commission calculates an Isle of Grain airport would cost up to £112bn - around five times that of its three short-listed options.  However, it said it would look at it in the first half of 2014, to reach a view on whether the option offered ""a credible proposal"".  ""The overall balance of economic impacts would be uncertain - particularly as an Estuary airport would require the closure of Heathrow for commercial reasons and London City for airspace reasons,"" it says.  Meanwhile, supporters of Heathrow's expansion say it will be quicker and cheaper than other options and will help to maintain the UK as an international aviation hub.  Heathrow's owners submitted evidence to the commission arguing that a new runway could be in place by 2029, allowing 260,000 more flights.  Colin Matthews, Heathrow chief executive, told the BBC: ""The case for Heathrow is strong. It's important that businesses can get around the globe to where economies are growing.  ""We've got Paris and Amsterdam, Frankfurt desperately trying to eat our lunch, they want to have the business that the UK benefits from today.""  John Cridland, head of business lobby group the CBI, said that urgent action was needed from the government when the commission's final recommendations were made in 2015.  ""It is no longer acceptable to bury our heads in the sand on this,"" he added.  Heathrow is one of the world's busiest hub airports, handling 70 million passengers in 2012.  But the airport operates at 98% of its capacity.  When the coalition government came to power in 2010, it scrapped the former Labour government's plan for a third runway at Heathrow.  The government said on Monday that it had not ruled out any options when it came to airport expansion in the south-east of England.  On Sunday, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said that the government would stick to its pledge not to build a new runway at Heathrow before 2015.  He told the BBC: ""We will not be building a third runway in this Parliament. We will stick by our manifesto commitment."""
653,"The legislation was passed by the parliament's upper house, having cleared the lower house last month.  The move marks a victory for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has made revising the constitution one of his top priorities, correspondents say.  The current constitution has not been changed since 1947.  Drawn up by the US occupation authorities after WWII, it bans military force in settling international disputes and prohibits maintaining a military for warfare.  But Mr Abe wants Japan to be more assertive on the world stage, with a military able to take part in peacekeeping missions abroad.  Mr Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is working on a draft of a new constitution.  The legislation passed by parliament says that a referendum on the issue cannot take place before 2010, and needs approval from a majority of voters.  ""Since this will take effect in three years, what is important is to deepen the debate among the people even further,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said.  Public opinion in Japan on the issue also appears to be mixed, with many in favour of some changes to the constitution while wanting the country to remain officially pacifist.  Four opposition groups - including the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) - opposed the bill because of divided public sentiment on the issue, Japan's Kyodo news agency said.  Critics of the proposed changes say the pacifist constitution has kept Japan out of war since the 1940s and allowed the country to focus on economic growth instead.  The move may also meet concern from South Korea and China, which remain suspicious of Japan because of its wartime aggressions.  Japan's constitution has been stretched in recent years to allow the country to have a self-defence force.  Under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, this was pushed still further, to allow troops to join peacekeeping missions in Iraq."
654,"The company, part of Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's Easygroup, made the announcement to its 80,000 registered customers by text message.  Sir Stelios had licensed his Easygroup brand to Danish Telecoms Company TDC, which launched Easymobile last year.  But TDC said it now planned to withdraw from the UK, after deciding the format did not work with British customers.  Easymobile will cease operating on 13 December, the company said in a statement on its website.  Sir Stelios said TDC's decision was disappointing, but added that he hoped to find a new mobile phone network to operate the Easy brand.  ""Easygroup will look for another supplier to work with, I don't easily give up,"" Sir Stelios told BBC Radio Five Live."
655,"Carlisle United have revealed plans to move from their Brunton Park home to a new stadium at Kingmoor in the north of the city.  The plans that would see a new 12,000 all-seater stadium built, ending a 102-year stay at their present home, were revealed to shareholders on Thursday.  Funding for the venue and surrounding buildings under the proposals would come from a development partner.  In addition, the new stadium would have office and training facilities.  A feasibility study found that the club's current site was a costly and unsuitable option for redevelopment.  Kingmoor Park was recommended by the study from 17 potential sites.  ""Everyone was very happy with the proposal,"" CUFC Online independent website editor Tim Graham told BBC Radio Cumbria, having attended the meeting.  ""From what the board were saying and the feasibity study, everyone in the meeting was for it.  ""Once everyone realises what's involved with it, I think a lot of people will be for it to be honest.""  The Cumbrians' existing ground meets the criteria set by the Football League to play in the bottom two tiers, but would not be suitable under regulations beyond that for the Championship.  ""Football League regulations, released in 2009, stipulated minimum ground standards which we are currently struggling to meet within Brunton Park,"" chairman John Nixon said within the statement.  ""The board would be doing a disservice to the fans if we didn't look into the future options for the club and report back to them for their input.""  Carlisle's next step is to present the findings and results of the study to supporters, which will take place on 24 November."
656,"Earlier reports quoting both Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and unnamed military sources had suggested that commandos crossed the border to prevent a flood of refugees.  Kurds in northern Iraq also told the Reuters news agency that no Turkish forces had arrived.  The denial comes amid fears that any incursion by Turkish trooops would raise tension with Iraqi Kurds and Turkey's Nato allies.  Turkish officials have in recent days repeated their determination to deploy the army in order to strengthen the security along the 300km-long border (about 190 miles).  But the US opposes such a move, fearing clashes between Turkish forces and Iraqi Kurdish factions and has repeated its objection to any unilateral move by the Turks into the area.  Turkey wants to prevents the Kurds forming a separate state. Iraqi Kurds say the presence of Turkish troops would threaten Iraq's territorial integrity.  The BBC's Jim Muir, who is in northern Iraq, says Iraqi Kurds fear a Turkish move would be directed against them rather than the Iraqi army.  Although the two main Kurdish factions are not threatening to attack the Turks, they have both said that the Kurdish people would not accept a Turkish presence and that sooner or later there would be trouble.  German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer threatened to withdraw its crews from Nato Awacs surveillance planes patrolling Turkish airspace if Ankara orders an invasion of Iraq.  After a long debate, Turkey decided to open its airspace to US warplanes attacking Iraq on Friday.  Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters the airspace agreement with the US was ""in Turkey's interests"".  Friday's agreement came after earlier talks between Turkey and US failed to resolve their differences.  Before the deal was announced, US Secretary of State Colin Powell had said: ""At the moment we do not see any need for any Turkish incursions into northern Iraq.""  The US originally asked Turkey to grant permission for 62,000 of its troops to use the country as a launch-pad for an attack on Iraq.  Turkey would have received a multi-billion-dollar compensation package in return, but US officials say the financial package has now been withdrawn.  Correspondents say that the airspace agreement allows an air bridge to be established to ferry special forces to a number of airfields in Kurdish-held northern Iraq.  This enables a northern front to be mounted against Iraqi Government forces."
657,"Levy Mwanawasa had been in poor health for several years The world may remember Zambia's President Levy Mwanawasa, who died aged 59 at a Paris hospital on Tuesday, as the African leader who dared to criticise Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe. But Zambians will remember him for standing up to his predecessor, Frederick Chiluba. He proved he was no puppet, despite being Mr Chiluba's chosen successor, within months of taking office in 2002 he had stripped the former president of his immunity from prosecution for corruption. He has also won plaudits from the international community for his fight against corruption and his economic policies. But his local critics accuse him of persecuting his political rivals, using the fig-leaf of corruption, and say he was just fortunate to benefit from a huge rise in the price of copper - Zambia's major export. Critics also say the benefits of the financial windfalls have not reached ordinary people. Some 70% of the population lives on less than $1 a day. The burly looking Lusaka lawyer and committed Christian could, however, point to his reputation for integrity, which he had built up over many years. He was famous for taking up cases that few lawyers would even contemplate    Many people who worked with him like George Kunda, the former chairman of the lawyers' association, said he did not tolerate injustice in any form and was vehemently opposed to the death penalty. In 1994, he resigned as vice-president, saying his integrity had been ""put in doubt"", following a row with minister without portfolio and cabinet enforcer Michael Sata, who later challenged him for the presidency. Regionally, he broke with tradition when he spoke out about the crisis in Zimbabwe, once comparing the economic situation there to ""a sinking Titanic"". Then as chairman of the Southern African Development Community, he said he sympathised with Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai when he withdrew from a controversial run-off vote in June because of attacks on his supporters. He suffered a stroke in Egypt on Sunday hours ahead of the opening of an African Union summit where Zimbabwe's election was to be addressed - and where he was expected to sit next to Mr Mugabe. Mr Mwanawasa campaigned on his economic record in 2006 In the early 1990s he was involved in a near-fatal road accident and was hospitalised in South Africa for almost a year. Since the accident his speech was slurred, something that may have hindered his popularity in the political arena where he was not noted for his charisma. He was first sworn in as president amid opposition protests over alleged fraud in the 2001 elections, but he convincingly won his second term four months after suffering a minor stroke. Although Mr Mwanawasa belonged to a small ethnic group called the Lenje, in central Zambia, he was born and brought up in the Copperbelt province. In 1970, he entered the law school at the University of Zambia, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Law degree in 1973. He had numerous professional distinctions, among them becoming the first Zambian lawyer to be appointed advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales. In Zambia, he was famous for taking up cases that few lawyers would even contemplate. But the one case that pushed him into prominence was a treason case in 1989. He had to defend former vice-president Lt Gen Christon Tembo and others who were charged with plotting to overthrow the government of the then president, Kenneth Kaunda. Mr Mwanawasa was married to a fellow lawyer Maureen. He had six children. As befitted his reputation for probity, he was said to be a man of modest habits.     "
658,"""Expulsion is the method which, in so far as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble,"" declared British prime minister Winston Churchill. ""A clean sweep will be made.""  This clean sweep, or the forced removal of millions of ethnic Germans from the liberated countries of eastern Europe in the immediate aftermath of war, was meant to spell the end of strife.  German nationalists had historically used the existence of German minorities in other countries to make territorial claims; Adolf Hitler used them to bolster his case for aggressive expansion.  But the row over the brutality which accompanied the expulsion of these people, many of whom were raped, beaten and killed, has yet to be tidily resolved. All of them lost their homes.  Decrees authorising the confiscation of property belonging to some of the 3 million ethnic Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia have soured relations with the Czech Republic several times, and the subject recently bubbled to the surface in Poland, where a similar process unfolded.  A fringe German group, the Prussian Trust, has begun a series of lawsuits against Poland to recover property seized after the war - a move which has prompted near national hysteria as Warsaw remembers the 200,000 Poles slaughtered by the Nazis in the 1944 uprising.  Speaking at the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising at the weekend, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder firmly distanced himself from claims for compensation by the group, which has filed for reparations for some 30,000 former German properties in Poland at the European Court of Human Rights.  But short of the German government constructing a legal settlement under which Germany would itself meet the compensation claims of the group, they cannot be stopped from pursuing their demands.  Germany's principal organisation representing the expelled and their families, the League of Expelled Germans, which has long demanded the Polish and Czech governments acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expelled, has also disassociated itself from the group.  But it believes Germany must go some way to addressing the demands - if only to give Poles legal certainty that the matter is closed and their property safe from the prospect of future lawsuits.  But for most of the expelled the issue was not one of property, but of ""sympathy and reconciliation"" between the people of both Germany and Poland, said the League's president, CDU politician Erika Steinbach.  The main aim of the League is the establishment of a centre dedicated to remembering those expelled across Europe, which would house a permanent exhibition on the fate of the ethnic Germans. They want it in Berlin.  Mr Schroeder does not want it built in Berlin - or anywhere in Germany for that matter, arguing that millions were expelled from their homelands during the 20th Century and that a German location would give undue prominence to the fate of the expelled Germans.  He has implied such a place could blur the historical issues behind the expulsions - a charge Ms Steinbach strenuously denies.  ""The centre against expulsion would be a place dedicated to truth, not to the perversion of history and the corruption of facts,"" she said, noting that the centre would finally endow the expelled and their families with a sense of identity.  Germans' own suffering, long a taboo, is increasingly a legitimate grounds for open discussion.  It was confronted most prominently by left-wing literary doyen Guenther Grass in Crabwalk, a novel which focused on the plight of the more than 8,000 German refugees who died when their boat was torpedoed by the Russians in 1945.  The book became an instant bestseller when it was published in 2002. A year later, the liberal German historian Joerg Friedrich published Places of Fire, a book of photographs featuring the burnt and mutilated corpses of the civilians who died during the Allied bombing of German cities.  It was controversial, but it reached the bookshops.  Besides the concerns about moral equivalency, some observers have hit out at what they see as a general scramble for victimhood status.  But while Mr Grass may have qualms about establishing a centre for the expelled in Berlin, he believes an open discussion is essential if German suffering during those years is not to become the preserve of the nationalist right."
659,"At least three protesters have been shot dead in the south Syrian city of Deraa as security forces clamped down on a protest rally.  They were killed by security forces as protesters demanded political freedom and an end to corruption, eyewitnesses and activists told foreign media.  President Bashar al-Assad, whose Baath party has dominated politics for nearly 50 years, tolerates no dissent.  Washington strongly condemned the use of force against demonstrators.  White House national security council spokesman Tommy Vietor said the US was calling on the Syrian government to ""allow demonstrations to take place peacefully"".  ""Those responsible for today's violence must be held accountable,"" he added.  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the ""use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators and their arbitrary arrests"" were ""unacceptable"", according to a spokesman.  ""It is the responsibility of the government in Syria to listen to the legitimate aspirations of the people and address them through inclusive political dialogue and genuine reforms, not repression,"" he added.  Syria's state news agency Sana said violence and ""acts of sabotage"" had broken out at a demonstration in Deraa on Friday, prompting security forces to intervene.  It accused ""infiltrators"" of seeking to ""provoke chaos through acts of violence which resulted in damage to private and public property"".  Two of the dead people were named by witnesses as Hussam Abdel Wali Ayyash and Akram Jawabreh.  They had been among ""several thousand"" demonstrators chanting ""God, Syria, Freedom"" and anti-corruption slogans, accusing the president's family of corruption, a resident told Reuters news agency.  Security forces, the Reuters source added, were reinforced with troops flown in by helicopters.  An unnamed human rights activist in Deraa, who was contacted by AFP news agency, said security forces had fired live bullets at the protesters and ""hundreds"" of protesters had also been wounded.  He told AFP that ""many"" of the wounded had been ""snatched by security forces"" from hospital and moved to unknown locations.  Mazen Darwish, a prominent Syrian activist in Damascus, was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that at least five people were shot and killed. He was citing eyewitnesses and hospital officials at the scene."
660,"Five teenagers in the Dominican Republic have been jailed for three to five years for murdering seven taxi drivers and injuring two more.  The youngsters, who are 15 to 17 years old, carried out a string of taxi robberies in April, police said.  During the assaults, they shot two of the drivers and killed five others by forcing them to drink drain cleaner.  They also doused the bodies with drain cleaner to prevent them from being identified, police said.  The victims' relatives had demanded that the teenagers, three boys and two girls, be treated as adults and serve up to 30 years in prison, the maximum penalty for murder in the Dominican Republic.  The sentencing came a day after the government of the Caribbean nation banned the sale of several drain cleaners because they have increasingly been used in violent assaults.  In August an eight-month-old baby and its mother died after the woman's partner doused both with drain cleaner, police said."

The Most Rev Mario Conti, 67, was named by the Pope as the successor to the late Cardinal Thomas Winning, who died in June 2001.  The first part of his officially becoming the archbishop of Glasgow takes place at St Andrew's Cathedral with a ceremony known as Vespers, or Evening Prayer of the Church.  This is followed on Friday by the second stage, which will see him celebrate Mass in the cathedral for the first time as archbishop.  Thursday evening's proceedings will hear a reading of the Papal Bull (letter of appointment) by the Vatican ambassador to the UK, Archbishop Pablo Puente. This came from Pope John Paul II on 15 January and talks of Mario Conti's ""sincere heart"" and ""diligent proclaimation of the truth"". Senior politicians, including First Minister Jack McConnell and Scottish Secretary Helen Liddell will be present. The Rt Rev John Miller, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, will also be in the congregation. Representatives of other Christian traditions, the Jewish and Islamic faiths have been invited. During the ceremony, representatives of the different aspects of the life of the Archdiocese of Glasgow will come to the bishop's chair to greet him and offer their homage. Later, he will walk to the front of the sanctuary to meet and greet the representatives of public life and ecumenical guests.  On Friday, the new archbishop will enter the cathedral behind a procession of 200 clerics, cardinals, archbishops, bishops and priests. The Right Reverend Conti, who has been Bishop of Aberdeen since 1977, has spoken out on ethical matters such as abortion and cloning. Speaking after his appointment, he said his new job would give him a platform to make those views more widely known. He said his priority in his new job would be to meet the priests of the diocese to ""find out their concerns"". The Rt Rev Conti was born in Elgin, Moray, on 20 March 1934 and educated at St Marie's Convent and Springfield School."
662,"Blatter held a meeting with the Scottish FA on Saturday Fifa president Sepp Blatter says a Great Britain football team at the 2012 Olympic Games should feature only English players. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football bodies oppose a GB team in case it affects their Fifa status, while England back the idea. Blatter now says said the independent status of the four British associations could be harmed by a unified GB team. ""They should enter only a team composed of players from England,"" said Blatter. ""This will then not provoke a long and endless discussion of the four British associations."" Are you excited by the prospect of a GB team? The International Olympic Committee does not recognise separate teams from Britain's home countries.     Olympic qualification has been impossible as it is based on Fifa's under-21 competitions in which the four home nations compete individually. Blatter was speaking from Gleneagles, Scotland, where the International Football Association annual meeting has been taking place. The Scottish FA reiterated its opposition to a unified team during a meeting with Blatter on Saturday. ""I said that is the best thing for you to do,"" said Blatter. ""If you start to put together a combined team for the Olympic Games, the question will automatically come up that there are four different associations so how can they play in one team. ""If this is the case then why the hell do they have four associations and four votes and their own vice-presidency?     ""This will put into question all the privileges that the British associations have been given by the Congress in 1946.""

664,"Who, What, Why: What is the quenelle gesture?  French footballer Nicolas Anelka has denied accusations of anti-Semitism after celebrating a goal by performing a controversial hand gesture known as a ""quenelle"". What is it?  The gesture involves touching or gripping your shoulder with one hand while holding the palm of your other hand outstretched and pointing to the ground. Some describe it as a combination of the bras d'honneur with a bent arm (which means ""up yours"") and the Nazi salute.  It is the trademark of the hugely controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who once said he would like to put a quenelle - a rugby-ball-shaped serving of fish or meat paste - up the backside of Zionists.  Dieudonne made the gesture when he headed his own anti-Zionist campaign in the European elections in 2009. French media trace it further back, to one of his performances in 2005. It came to greater prominence in September when two soldiers were photographed appearing to make the gesture outside a Paris synagogue.  There are thousands of examples posted online, some at sensitive sites such as the Auschwitz death camp, and Dieudonne's fans can be seen repeating it outside his theatre.  West Bromwich Albion striker Anelka said on Twitter it was dedicated to his ""comedian friend"" - who has been convicted of making anti-Semitic remarks and now faces a ban on public appearances. Both Anelka and Dieudonne say it is an anti-establishment symbol of defiance. But the French sports minister, Valerie Fourneyron, was one of many to disagree with the footballer's interpretation, saying it was sickening and incited racial hatred.  Jean-Yves Camus, a French academic who studies the extreme right, told the Independent the quenelle has become a ""badge of identity, especially among the young, but it is doubtful that all of them understand its true meaning"". He says Dieudonne has become the hero of a movement convinced the world is run by Washington and Tel Aviv.  ""I think it's likely to be more complex than just being associated with the far right,"" says Jim Shields of Aston University, an expert on the French far right, because Dieudonne has been involved with anti-racist left-wing activists as well as far-right activists. ""At the moment, the use of this gesture seems too diffuse to fit any simple right-left interpretation.""  Anelka is not the first French footballer playing in England to make the gesture. Samir Nasri and Mamadou Sakho were also photographed in this way, although Sakho later tweeted that he had been tricked and didn't realise its true meaning.

They started their illustrious careers in their home-town of Birmingham, back in 1990, when they took an unknown reggae artist called Apache Indian, to the top of the charts with a track called ‘Boom Shak-a-Lak’!      Since then they have gone from strength to strength producing albums for both Asian and mainstream artists. Shania Twain     The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites. Shania Twain's new album Up! breaks new boundaries for the country singer.      Drawing inspiration from the Asian subcontinent, Shania and her production team have created an entirely separate production of her brand new album, in the form of the ‘Blue Mixes’ - Asian and Eastern influenced versions of the album Up!     The Blue Mixes are produced by leading Asian producers Simon and Diamond. The Duggal brothers were initially invited to play as musicians to add Indian influences to one track for Shania’s forthcoming album, back in May of last year.      But once Shania and her producer-husband Mutt Lange heard what the pair were capable of, they decided to go the whole hog and produce a completely separate version of the album.     Said Diamond: ""Working with the orchestra out in India was a great experience for us. They are true masters of their instruments, and we hope that the orchestrations and mixes that we have produced will put Indian music on the map for a whole new audience.""      Pam Sambhi, presenter of the Asian youth programme for Manchester DubAsia, talked to Diamond about working with Shania Twain.      Listen to the full interview >>>     "

This is the story of Karan Shergill who is very confused about the directions he needs to take in life. Coming from a well off family, he never gave it a thought on what he wants to be, when he grows up. So he just ends up in the Indian Army with n o The only person he can rely on is Romila Dutta (Priety Zinta), a bright ambitious young woman who is capable of standing on her own two feet. She loves Karan since childhood and believes that one day he will find himself. As days go by, Karan finds it difficult to cope with the gruelling army life. Unable to take it any longer, Karan resigns from the academy. But his home coming is strongly dissapproved by his father and Romila. This also creates bad feelings between Karan and his girlfriend. So they go their separate ways. Some time later, Karan and Romila meet again, under different circumstances. India and Pakistan are at war. Romila is now a war correspondant for a television channel. Based in Kashmir, she comes across Karan who by now has graduated as an army officer. An officer with one aim and that is to fight for his country tooth and nail. . . . Young Farhan Akhtar, proves yet again that he is one of the finiest directors Bollywood has to date. He has paid full attention to the script and the technical aspects, giving rise to a polished product similar to his debut film, Dil Chahta Hai. Farhan did good in hiring German Christopher Popp who has captured the cinematography of Ladakh beautifully. The action scenes are worth mentioning. Unlike other mediocre Bollywood films, the war scenes appear realistic. The sequence when Lt. Shergill and his fellow soldiers climb the cliff to surprise the intruders at the top of the mountainous Kargil region, is well executed by the director. Background score by the music directors, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy add further inpact to the film especially towards the climax. Hrithik Roshan has already proved in Koi Mil Gaya that he is a versatile actor. He has shown that he can play different characters. In Lakshya he sports a different hairstyle which adds dept to the happy go lucky character of Karan Shergill. It's so refreshing to see how he transforms from a carefree youth to a matured soldier full of determination and courage. Priety Zinta looks good throughout and holds her own thorughout the film. Other casts including Amitabh Bachchan, Om Puri, Amrish Puri Sharad Kapoor, Boman Irani and Sushant Singh, make full contribution to the storyline. On the whole, Lakshya is a well crafted film different from other Bollywood masalas currently being released. Well worth watching! No doubt it will do tremendous business in the UK with a high entry in the UK top ten charts."
667,"The Mersey - once the most polluted river in Europe - can support fish throughout its estuary for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, scientists have discovered.  It now has sufficient oxygen in it to support life, following a 20-year clean-up costing £1bn.  Scientists have recorded oxygen levels of well over 60%, compared to the late 1970s when tests found none at all in many areas.  Fish need oxygen levels of at least 30% to survive.  The pollution was the legacy of raw sewage and industrial waste including chemicals being discharged into the river.  George Ager, of the Environment Agency, said: ""This is fantastic news for the Mersey.  ""It was once a prolific fishery famed for its salmon, but after the Industrial Revolution it became infamous for pollution.  ""Not so long ago, people said there were no fish in the estuary, and folklore was that you couldn't drown in it because you'd be poisoned first.  ""But nearly 20 years of hard work have paid off and now we have an estuary to be proud of.""  Tighter regulations on industrial pollution and a huge effort to stop sewage getting into the river have helped clean the river.  In 2002 the agency captured and returned 26 salmon at a fish trap at Woolston Weir, near Warrington.  Other varieties of fish, including brown trout, sea trout, lamprey, dace and cod are also now frequently caught by anglers.  Water sports, including sailing and windsurfing, are also becoming increasingly popular as a result of the clean up, the agency said."
668,"Argentine writer and human rights champion Ernesto Sabato has died aged 99 at his home near Buenos Aires.  His wife, Elvira Gonzalez Fraga, said he had suffered from bronchitis.  He won some of the most prestigious prizes in Hispanic literature but he was also known for his criticism of military regimes in Latin America.  He headed the ""Dirty War"" commission that investigated the killings of thousands of people under Argentina's military rule in the 1970s and '80s.  Sabato's works include The Tunnel (1948), On Heroes and Tombs (1961) and The Angel of Darkness (1974).  When appointed in 1983 to investigate the fate of those who disappeared during Argentina's military rule, he described the task as ""a slow descent into hell"".  His commission's comprehensive account was later used to prosecute nine members of the military establishment.  As a young man, Sabato studied physics and earned a doctorate, but became disenchanted with what he saw as the misuse of science.  When he lost his job as a university lecturer in Argentina after criticising the government at the time, he gave up on science altogether.  He became very influential in the literary world throughout Latin America, despite the fact that he had only published three novels - the only survivors of his tendency to burn his manuscripts.  ""It's not reasonable, really, but all my life I tended to destroy things - my own things - not other people's,"" he once said.  ""It may be because I considered that all my work was imperfect, impure, and I found that fire was purifying.  ""I was about to burn On Heroes and Tombs after many years of work, but my wife became ill because of this decision, so I changed my mind.""  On Heroes and Tombs, his second novel, is considered to be his masterpiece.  Sabato was also a prolific essayist who wrote about metaphysics, politics and tango.  The irony of Sabato's life is that while he did much to bring light to the cruelties of the Dirty War, his own writings were dark and brooding portrayals of worlds of secrets and madness."
669,"The Newspaper Society is updating its guidelines on those adverts which should be accepted on classified pages.  It wants its members to be especially aware of the link between organised prostitution and human trafficking.  The society has already advised its members on how to spot adverts which might be promoting sexual services.  For example it tells them to be wary of ads for massage parlours, which might be a front for brothels.  The society, which represents most local and regional papers, is suggesting they simply refuse such ads.  It also suggests that payment be made by card or cheque so accounts can be traced, and that papers consult with police.  The updated guidance follows a meeting with Harriet Harman last year in her role as minister for women, the society is sending out updated guidance to papers which stresses the link between organised prostitution and human trafficking .  Ms Harman, now Labour chairman and the leader of the House of Commons, is concerned that a growing number of young girls are being smuggled into this country and forced into prostitution."
670,"A Japanese woman has been found guilty of murdering four people and injuring 63 others by serving them arsenic-laced curry at a village festival in 1998.  Masumi Hayashi, 41, was sentenced to hang by a district court in the prefecture of Wakayama, 450 kilometres (280 miles) west of Tokyo, where the poisoning took place.  Hayashi's lawyers immediately appealed the case to the Osaka High Court, local media reported.  The case has gripped Japan, and more than 2,200 people arrived at the court on Wednesday to try to hear the verdict, a court spokesman told AFP news agency.  The poisoning also sparked a rash of copycat incidents across Japan.  Hayashi denied she was responsible for the curry poisoning at the start of her trial in May 1999, but has since refused to testify.  Prosecutors have failed to supply concrete proof of her guilt, relying instead on circumstantial evidence.  Hayashi, a mother of four, was found guilty of mixing arsenic into a curry served at a summer festival in the Sonobe district of Wakayama.  Chemical experts had testified that the arsenic found in the curry was ""the same product"" as the arsenic kept at Hayashi's house by her husband Kenji, who worked as a termite exterminator.  Judge Ikuo Ogawa said that Hayashi had looked after the curry pot on her own during the time in which it was presumed the poisoning took place.  ""There was no-one among the people in the area who had such opportunity to put arsenic into the pot but the defendant,"" Judge Ogawa told the court.  The key prosecution witnesses included a high-school girl who said she had seen Hayashi ""walking around the pots like a bear"" in the garage of the house where the curry was cooked.  Prosecutors argued that Hayashi, a former insurance saleswoman, was motivated by anger towards her neighbours, who reportedly shunned her.  Hayashi's husband is currently serving a six-year term for insurance fraud.  Hayashi has been held in jail since she was arrested in October 1998.  In May 2000 she was rushed to hospital after swallowing metal nails, apparently during the course of a nervous breakdown.  According to the rights group Amnesty International, there are at least 118 people currently on death row in Japan, some 50 of whom have had their sentences upheld and can be executed at any time.  Prisoners are informed they are going to be executed less than two hours before they are hanged, AI says, and family and friends are not told in advance.  In recent weeks the Japan Federation of Bar Associations has called for a moratorium on executions so a public debate can be held on Japan's capital punishment policy."
671,"Mr George has released a statement saying: ""I was disappointed to see the misinterpretation of my remarks.  ""In fact, I said explicitly that rising unemployment in the north-east was undesirable.""  Mr George made his original comment in answer to a question asked at the lunch on whether he thought job losses in the north were an acceptable price to pay for curbing inflation in the south.  Mr George is reported to have replied: ""Yes, I suppose in a sense I am.  ""It's not desirable, but the fact is we can only seek to affect through monetary policy the state of demand in the economy as a whole. It's only through monetary policy that we can determine what happens to the Labour market as a whole.""  In his latest statement, Mr George has further clarified his position: ""I made it clear that monetary policy can only target the economy as a whole, not particular regions or sectors, however uncomfortable that reality might be.""  The cuts and others have prompted calls for significant cuts to interest rates and criticism that the Bank of England and the Government are ignoring the plight of manufacturers, especially those in the North.  Some Labour MPs called on Mr George to resign as a result of his comments.  However, chancellor Gordon Brown has declared his support for Mr George in the wake of the controversy, and his Monetary Policy Committee over their interest rate decisions.  ""I am happy with the way Eddie George and the Bank of England are doing their jobs and I support them in the difficult decisions they have made,"" he told the BBC's One O'Clock News.  The Labour MP for Rotherham, Denis MacShane, made the demand during a Commons debate on the steel industry.  His resignation call was met with cheers of ""hear, hear"" by Labour backbenchers and immediately endorsed by Labour's Llewellyn Smith (Blaenau Gwent).  Mr MacShane told the House: ""I believe that statement exposes the fallacy of having our economy controlled and determined by the values of the City.  Before Mr George's clarification, Mr MacShane said: ""I believe he may have been misquoted. If so, he needs to clarify.  A union leader claimed it was a ""further nail in the coffin"" of the credibility of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee.  Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, said: ""The MPC has proved beyond doubt that it is out of touch with events in the real world.  ""Eddie George has shown a complete disregard for the effects his policies are having on ordinary people and their families who are thrown on the unemployment scrapheap by his intransigence.  ""The MPC must act now and follow the lead of the two members who voted for a larger cut at the October meeting and if they don't, the Chancellor should use his powers to replace them."""
672,"A ""comprehensive assessment"" of the state of a rig grounded on a Lewis beach has still to be made, an official overseeing its salvage has said.  Transocean Winner ran aground at Dalmore beach on Monday and has lost more than 12,000 gallons (56,000 litres) of diesel oil from fuel tanks.  Hugh Shaw said a full assessment was needed before the rig could be moved.  Bad weather has prevented a team of eight salvors from following up a visit made to the rig on Tuesday.  Mr Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, who is overseeing the salvage operation, has told BBC Scotland that a suggestion the rig could be moved next week was ""highly unlikely"".  The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said efforts would continue to try and airlift the team of salvage experts on to the rig.  It said once on board, the squad would be able to carry out a further damage assessment and inspect the Transocean Winner's emergency generator to establish what power is available.  Mr Shaw said: ""There needs to be a comprehensive assessment of the state of the rig before a salvage plan can be drawn up and put into place.""  An exclusion zone remains in place around the rig.  The Transocean Winner was being towed from Norway to Malta from where it was to be moved to a yard in Turkey to be broken up.  A tow line between the rig and a tug broke during stormy weather and the structure ran aground at Dalmore at about 07:30 on Monday."
673,"The violence is the first in six days of protests by opposition supporters calling for the president to resign.  Overnight, opposition MPs held an emergency session in parliament to try to pass a new constitution to curb the president's powers.  The government called the move an ""open attempt at seizing power"".  Several people were injured in the clashes that broke out in the centre of Bishkek. Russian media reported four people had suffered gunshot wounds.  The fighting broke out as thousands of opposition supporters continued their protest close to government buildings, while a pro-government rally of several hundred got under way nearby.  Hundreds of police - some armed and others in full riot gear - encircled the centre of the city where the two demonstrations were taking place, the BBC's Natalia Anteleva reports.  They fired warning shots and used tear gas as bottles, sticks and stones were thrown by both sides.  The violence follows an emergency session of parliament called by the opposition, during which they signed a new draft constitution handing some of the president's powers to parliament.  Opposition MPs said 41 of parliament's 75 deputies signed the document, enough for a simple majority.  But it is not clear if the vote would make the document legal, as Kyrgyz law requires any changes to the constitution to have a two-thirds majority.  Constitutional Court Chairwoman Cholpon Bayekova told the Associated Press news agency that a smaller number of MPs could adopt the law as the situation was ""extraordinary"".  The government in a statement called the meeting ""nothing other than an open attempt at seizing power through anti-constitutional means"".  And President Bakiyev warned that he could dissolve parliament if the crisis continues.  ""I have not set myself the goal of dissolving parliament,"" he told a news conference.  ""But I have such a constitutional right and of course if contradictions between the legislature and the executive continues what will I have left to do? I cannot watch such an orgy.""  The opposition accuse President Bakiyev of pushing the country into a political deadlock by failing to agree to democratic reforms he promised when he was elected in March 2005.  Mr Bakiyev has urged patience, saying reforms should not be adopted in an ""hour or two"". But the opposition says his time has run out."
674,"Queen's University, Belfast, is to close the department which organised a conference to discuss the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo murders in France last year.  The Belfast university initially cancelled the conference in April 2015, citing concerns about the security risk for delegates and the reputation of the university.  However, after widespread criticism from novelists, poets and academics, it later reversed its decision and the conference went ahead.  Now, staff at the Institute for Collaborative Research in the Humanities (ICRH) - which held the event - have been told that it is closing.  The news came in a letter from the university's Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Prof Adrienne Scullion.  In it, she wrote that the ICRH ""will cease operation from 31 July, with all activities being wound up with immediate effect"".  The BBC understands that the Institute's director, Prof John Thompson, left the university last week.  Of the other 19 staff, about half were full-time researchers, some of whom have secured academic jobs elsewhere, while others have been transferred to other departments in Queen's.  Dr Brian Klug, from Oxford University, who took part in the Charlie Hebdo conference, said the work of the institute had reflected very well on Queen's University.  ""It augmented the university's reputation in the world,"" he said.  ""In particular, the symposium on the Charlie Hebdo affair was outstanding, setting an example of social responsibility for other universities to follow.""  ""I was enormously impressed by the calibre, integrity and initiative of the academic staff and I am terribly sorry at the university's decision to close the Institute down.""  Alan Harpur from the University and College Union also criticised the decision to close the ICRH.  ""Some people will be saying it's a result of Charlie Hebdo, and Queen's getting its own back,"" he said.  ""In the absence of Queen's explaining itself fully to the staff concerned, those rumours are going to continue.""  However, a spokesperson for the university said the decision had been taken in the context of wider plans for the future of Queen's.  ""As part of this exercise, the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences is evolving a strategy to grow more collaboration and cross-disciplinary research and teaching activity,"" they said.  ""The ambition that the university and the faculty has for collaboration and cross-disciplinary activity is being taken forward in a number of new ways.""  ""These include the establishment within the faculty of a new global research institute - the Senator George J Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice.""  Twelve people died when two brothers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, fired on journalists on 7 January 2015 at Charlie Hebdo's offices in Paris.  Five others were killed over the two following days by one of their associates."
675,"Liverpool have confirmed that they plan to redevelop their existing home at Anfield, rather than building a new stadium in nearby Stanley Park.  The capacity is set to be extended from 45,276 to 60,000, while the project will cost around £150m with Liverpool committing to building a hotel.  The city's council has secured a £25m grant to regenerate the wider area.  ""This is step one as there is land to acquire, plans to be approved,"" said Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre.  ""But this is a significant moment. Today represents a huge step forward for the Anfield area.""  A planning application is not expected to be submitted until next summer and little information has yet been revealed on the exact details of the project.  Full plans will be drawn up in the coming months before a public consultation. If the process remains on schedule, it is hoped work will begin in 2014.  Redevelopment is likely to see extensions to the Main Stand and the Anfield Road end. It is not clear where the hotel would be on the site.  Residents raised concerns earlier this year about any expansion and it remains uncertain exactly how many houses would be affected by any compulsory purchase orders.  The plan will see a number of streets close to Anfield cleared, such as Lothair Road, Alroy Road and Sybil Road, with hundreds of properties in four areas of the Liverpool suburb renovated.  A number of terraced streets will be reshaped, while scores of residents in the areas affected could be relocated to newly upgraded properties nearby.  The redeveloped Anfield will be the centrepiece of the council's £175m regeneration project of the L4 area.  ""This is a major step forward for the football club but more importantly the residents,"" added Ayre.  ""We welcome the opportunity to be part of this partnership - we want to thank [mayor of Liverpool] Joe Anderson and the council for the time and the support they've given us to help make the right decision.  ""LFC celebrated its 120th year in 2012 at Anfield and there is no doubt Anfield is the spiritual home of the club - our preference was always to remain at Anfield.""  The club's owners, Fenway Sports Group (FSG), which also runs American baseball team Boston Red Sox, faced a similar situation with the Red Sox's ground, Fenway Park.  After conducting a feasibility study lasting about a year, FSG opted to redevelop the 100-year-old stadium."
676,"The Enemy of the World is the only story in Patrick Troughton's 'Monster Season' that doesn't actually feature any monsters.  It does, however, have some men with funny hats and strange black PVC outfits in it.  Location for the story took place at Climping Beach near Littlehampton, West Sussex - not quite as good as sunny Australia, but close, and only a few miles form the Arundel Castle location used just over 20 years later for Silver Nemesis.  The Enemy of the World features footage of an exploding helicopter, taken from the Bond movie From Russia With Love.  Patrick Troughton's son David makes his first appearance in Doctor Who, as an extra in episodes five and six. David went on to play a soldier in The War Games and King Peladon in The Curse of Peladon.  Another Doctor Who debutant was director Barry Letts. After starting his career as an actor, Letts turned to scriptwriting in the 1960s. He'd previously submitted story ideas to the Doctor Who production office, but these were not taken up.  After taking the BBC's internal directors' course in 1967, Letts worked on Z Cars and The Newcomers before getting his first Doctor Who assignment with The Enemy of the World.  Barry eventually became the show's producer throughout the Third Doctor era, and briefly returned as Executive Producer to oversee Season Eighteen - John Nathan Turner's first as producer.  George Pravda, who played Denes, went on to portray Jaeger in the Mutants and Castellan Spandrell in The Deadly Assassin. Milton Johns (Benik) also went on to play a Castellan - Kelner in The Invasion of Time. Small Universe, isn't it?  The Enemy Of The World was the final story overseen by producer Innes Lloyd, who went on to produce The Stone Tape and Talking Heads for the BBC. Lloyd was replaced by his story editor Peter Bryant, with Derrick Sherwin taking over Bryant's job.  Of the six episodes, only episode three still exists in the BBC's video archives. It was released on the compilation tape The Troughton Years. Audio recordings exist of all six episodes, however. These were released by the BBC Radio Collection in August 2002, with new linking narration from Frazer Hines.  Sadly for Photonovel fans, the telesnaps of episode four do not exist. We are therefore presenting a simplified version of the episode using other images from the story to illustrate Marcus Hearn's captions."
677,"The 65-year-old, who won the Open at the home of golf in 1970 and 1978, admitted his final tournament at the Old Course will be an emotional time.  ""I'm very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there,"" said the 18-time major winner.  ""In May I walked around and welled up with hardly anyone watching me. I want to finish on Sunday, that's my goal.""  Nicklaus played his last Masters at Augusta in April, filling up with tears as he played the 18th before missing the cut.  But he had earmarked St Andrews to make his final bow as he downscales his tournament commitments.  He said: ""St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career.  ""I really believe I can make the cut. The course is not too long for me, the loop hasn't been lengthened and I can get to all those holes in two.  ""So I'm going there in the hope of being able to compete.""  The player dubbed ""the Golden Bear"" only once finished lower than sixth in the 18 Opens between 1963 and 1980, winning three times including the infamous 1970 win after Doug Sanders missed a tiddler for the title.  He picked up his second victory at St Andrews in 1978 after overhauling American rival Tom Watson.  ""After my first Open victory at Muirfield in 1966 the people of Scotland took me as one of theirs,"" he said.  ""When I won at St Andrews four years later it was like a Scot winning the Open.  ""I have loved it from my first day there in 1964. I love the fun of the course and the challenge it presents.  ""Take the 18th hole. I've played it with a driver and a five iron. You never know. And then there are my feelings about the Open itself.  ""Over the years I always believed I could win or be close - and I was - but I never felt that in the United States.""  At St Andrews, Nicklaus' caddie will be his son Stevie, whose own 17-month-old son Jake was found dead in a hot tub at home in February.  Nicklaus said: ""Steve and his wife Krista cry themselves to sleep every night and we've spent our time hugging.  ""They will never get over what happened and want to keep Jake's memory forever.  ""My support team has been very beneficial to me over the last year and I hope they get to watch me in four days of golf and not blink and find my career is over on the Friday."""
678,"Alaska Air Group has agreed to buy Virgin America in a $4bn (£2.8bn) deal to create the fifth largest US airline.  It will enable Seattle-based Alaska to expand into lucrative hubs such as San Francisco and Los Angeles.  The two boards ""unanimously approved"" the deal, which will see Alaska acquire Virgin America for $57 (£40) a share.  However, Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson said there was ""sadly nothing [he] could do to stop"" the deal.  It is the first US commercial airline merger since US Airways and American Airlines combined in 2013 to make the world's largest carrier.  Virgin America, which accounts for about 1.5% of US domestic flight capacity, was listed on the US stock market in 2014 as an offshoot of London-based Virgin Group.  In a company blog, Sir Richard said: ""I would be lying if I didn't admit sadness that our wonderful airline is merging with another.  ""Because I'm not American, the US Department of Transportation stipulated I take some of my shares in Virgin America as non-voting shares, reducing my influence over any takeover. So there was sadly nothing I could do to stop it.""  He added that consolidation is a trend that ""cannot be stopped"", with the four largest airlines now controlling more than 80% of the US market.  Alaska and its partner regional airlines, which in total account for about 5% of US domestic flight capacity, serve more than 100 cities in the US, Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico.  If the deal gets approval from US government regulators and Virgin America shareholders, the companies expect to complete the transaction by 1 January 2017.  Brad Tilden, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Air Group, said: ""With our expanded network and strong presence in California, we'll offer customers more attractive flight options for non-stop travel.""  Virgin America shares surged 40% to $54.52 - just below the offer price - in early trading.  Alaska, which was reported to have beaten competition from rival airline Jet Blue for the company, fell 4.7% to $78.15."
679,"After lurching from one military coup to another, Nigeria now has an elected leadership. But the government faces the growing challenge of preventing Africa's most populous country from breaking apart along ethnic and religious lines.  Thousands of people have died over the past few years in communal attacks led by the Islamic State-aligned Boko Haram.  Separatist aspirations have also been growing and the imposition of Islamic law in several northern states has embedded divisions and caused thousands of Christians to flee.  Nigeria's insecurity has added to its economic woes, hindering foreign investment. The former British colony is one of the world's largest oil producers, but few Nigerians, including those in oil-producing areas, have benefited.  A former military ruler, Muhammadu Buhari swept to a historic election victory in March 2015 when he became the first opposition candidate to win a Nigerian presidential poll.  After helping oust elected President Shehu Shagari in 1983, the then Maj-Gen Buhari led a regime that sought to combat crime and corruption, but was also accused of serious rights abuses. In 1985, he was overthrown by Gen Ibrahim Babangida.  Now, Mr Buhari has distanced himself from military rule, promising to respect democracy and govern as a civilian leader.  He scored a major diplomatic success in June 2015 when neighbouring countries agreed to Nigeria commanding a joint force to counter Boko Haram, rather than rotating the command among themselves.  There have been major concerns over his health.  Reporters Without Borders ranked Nigeria 111th out of 180 countries in its 2015 World Press Freedom Index. The Freedom House organisation says the authorities ""regularly harass, intimidate, and attack journalists in the field"".  Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, has also threatened the media. It bombed newspaper offices in Abuja and Kaduna in April 2012.  Nevertheless, Nigeria's media scene is one of the most vibrant in Africa.  16-18th centuries - Slave trade: millions of Nigerians are forcibly sent to the Americas.  1850s - Britain establishes presence around Lagos, which it consolidates over the next 70 years as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.

680,"As Delhi prepares to mark 100 years as India's capital, a previously lost diary written by an Anglo-Irish aristocrat has provided a fascinating insight into an extraordinary but largely forgotten act of dissent against colonial rule by an Indian maharajah.  Lilah Wingfield witnessed the moment 100 years ago when, in front of 100,000 spectators, the Gaekwar of Baroda, otherwise known as Maharajah Sayyaji Rao III, bowed improperly when presenting himself before the British monarch, then turned his back disrespectfully and walked away.  It was an audacious act of defiance at an event that contemporary observers have described as a thousand times grander than royal weddings over the past 60 years in London.  The 1911 Delhi durbar, or mass assembly - when George V was proclaimed Emperor of India - was the only such assembly to be attended by a British monarch in person.  The durbar was a display of unparalleled grandeur attended by nearly all of the great and the good in British India, who stayed in a tented city near Delhi that accommodated 250,000 visitors, guests and their servants.  Each Indian ruler or ""native prince"" was expected to perform proper obeisance to the King-Emperor by bowing three times before him, then backing away without turning.  The maharajah not only ignored royal etiquette by turning his back on the king and queen after formally introducing himself but compounded his perceived insolence by reportedly ""laughing disrespectfully"" as he departed from their presence.  Lilah Wingfield's observations are recorded in a book by her granddaughter, Jessica Douglas-Home, about her travels in India at a time when it is now realised that British colonial rule had reached its zenith. Within 40 years, India would be independent.  Although Mrs Douglas-Home inherited her grandmother's photos of the durbar, the diary detailing Miss Wingfield's views of the event was lost for many years before being discovered in an English secondhand bookshop and sent on to her.  ""They reveal that the Gaekwar of Baroda - second in importance only to the Nizam of Hyderabad - broke every rule in [Viceroy of India] Lord Hardinge's book,"" Mrs Douglas-Home writes in A Glimpse of Empire.  ""He arrived at the amphitheatre in full dress and covered in the historic Baroda jewels, but removed them all just before the moment came for him to approach the king.  ""On reaching the shamiana (dais) he made a cursory bow from the waist, stepped backwards and then, wheeling around, turned his back on the royal couple and walked from their presence nonchalantly twirling a gold-topped walking stick.""  Mrs Douglas-Home said the maharajah's gesture caused shock among British officials attending the event.  From then until his death in 1939 he was for the most part ostracised by the British authorities even though he wrote a letter of apology soon afterwards which said that if he had not seemed to conform to the ritual, it was due to ""nervousness and confusion in the presence of Their Majesties"".  The maharajah was partly rehabilitated in 1919 when he was made a Knight Grand Commander by the British.  The actions of the maharajah are today seen by Indian and British historians as coinciding with the beginning of the end of British rule in India.  ""It was a brave and symbolic act of resistance carried out at an enormous event in front of anybody who was anyone in British India,"" says Anna Jackson, head of the Asian department of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  ""No-one could have predicted that barely three decades later the entire British edifice would collapse.  ""The event was supposed to be a show of strength in which Indian royal families paid homage to their king.""  Indian historian Amar Farooqi says that while the maharajah's actions showed ""commendable bravery"" it was not at the time - or in later years - given as much attention as it merited.  ""It was one of the strongest gestures of dissent by a princely ruler,"" he said, ""and took place against a backdrop of growing support for India's independence movement.""  Prof Farooqi says that while the British played down the maharajah's dissent, few Indians - apart from well-connected nationalist leaders - would even have known that it had happened.  ""It is not recognised much now because nationalists campaigning for Indian independence at the time and in later years did not want to be associated with princely rulers,"" Prof Farooqi said. ""Their perceived decadence was a source of some embarrassment.  ""They wanted that part of the independence struggle to be be deleted from history because maharajahs were seen as too closely associated with the worst excesses of the Raj.  ""That is why today in India so few schoolchildren know about the rulers of princely states. Princely India simply does not exist in the textbooks"".  Prof Farooqi says, however, that the maharajah has received recognition for the pioneering reforms he introduced - many ahead of their time - in Baroda.  He was the first Indian ruler to introduce compulsory and free primary education in his state in 1906, placing it far in advance of the rest of British India.  In addition he played a key role in the development of Baroda's textile and banking industries, expanded women's rights, improved access to education, banned child marriages and legislated against discrimination between different castes.  But he is probably most widely remembered in India today for his decision in 1913 to finance three years of postgraduate studies for BR Ambedkar, revered as the principal author of the Indian constitution, at Columbia University.  The maharajah's legacy is one which his grandson, Ranjitsinh Gaekwad, says is a ""constant source of pride"".  ""At that time it boosted the morale of all those working towards achieving independence for India,"" he said.  ""He wanted to instil in his countrymen a sense of pride and self esteem, which he achieved by this and many other actions. Baroda state was the one of the best administered states of British India."""
681,"Henry Allingham also took his Scout Promise when he was invested Britain's oldest man and one of the last survivors of World War I has been invested as a scout, 100 years after he first joined the movement. Henry Allingham, who celebrated his 112th birthday in June, joined the 6th Brighton Scouts as part of the group's 30th birthday celebrations. He said he was only able to spend six weeks with his local group as a boy. Mr Allingham said he had ""really enjoyed it"" and wanted to join but his mother could not afford the uniform. The war veteran was invited to join the birthday celebrations of the Sussex scout group after they heard he had missed out. He spoke to loads of the cubs and beavers... they will always remember meeting him    He was presented with a special certificate on behalf of the Chief Scout Peter Duncan by 12-year-old scout Chris Denham. ""It was great to meet Henry, it's cool that he is exactly 100 years older than I am and I feel really proud to have met him,"" the youngster said. ""He spoke to loads of the cubs and beavers... they will always remember meeting him."" Mr Allingham also took his Scout Promise when he was invested into the organisation. Simon Carter, from the Scout Association, added: ""Henry was a real inspiration to the girls and boys in the 6th Brighton. ""He is certainly the oldest living scout in the whole of Europe and probably the oldest living scout in the world. ""Henry had a sparkle in his eye when he joined in the celebrations... he told me that just being around young people and adults with so much energy and enthusiasm for life made him feel young again.""

682,"An internet message purportedly from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's militant group was released on Thursday, claiming Ihab al-Sherif had been killed.  A video on the website showed a blindfolded man who identified himself as Mr Sherif saying he had worked at Egyptian embassies in Iraq and Israel.  Cairo is an ally of the US and Iraqi governments.  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak offered his condolences to Mr Sherif's family and said his government would not be deterred from supporting Iraq.  Top Sunni cleric Mohamed Sayed Tantawi condemned the killing as a ""crime against religion, morality and humanity and a crime that goes against honour and chivalry"".  But opposition leaders blamed the government saying it had been hasty in sending him to Iraq and had done it to please Washington.  ""His blood is on the hands of those who sent him to Iraq at this time,"" Dia el-Din Dawoud, leader of the Arab nationalist and leftist Nasserite Party told Reuters news agency.  ""Egypt wanted to stand out by sending the first Arab ambassador to Iraq, but as long as our policies do not spring from our national and Arab interests, this will be the outcome.""  Muslim Brotherhood deputy leader Mohamed Habib said that while the killing was incompatible with Islam, the US occupation of Iraq was the main reason for it.  Mr Sherif was abducted in Baghdad on Saturday. ID cards bearing his name appeared on a website on Wednesday.  A statement also released on Wednesday in the name of al-Qaeda in Iraq said Mr Sherif would be killed because he was an ""apostate"", who had betrayed his faith.  It criticised the Cairo government for its support of the US and Iraqi administrations.  Al-Qaeda claims to have beheaded several foreign hostages in Iraq under the leadership of Zarqawi, a Jordanian fugitive.  A written statement on the website on Thursday said ""the verdict of God against the ambassador of the infidels, the ambassador of Egypt, has been carried out"".  According to the statement, Mr Sherif's captors had recorded his ""confessions"" and planned to release them later.  No images of Mr Sherif's killing were shown. It is unclear on what basis the Egyptian government has become convinced that he is dead.  Mr Sherif had been in Baghdad since early June.  The statement said the group had been planning to abduct more foreign envoys in Iraq.  ""The reason we delayed the announcement of capturing the ambassador of the dictator Egypt was to be able to capture as many ambassadors as we can,"" it said.  Bahrain's envoy to Baghdad was hurt in an attack by gunmen earlier this week. The Pakistani envoy to Iraq escaped unhurt after gunmen attacked his vehicle."
683,"2002 has been a phenomenal year for pop favourites Atomic Kitten.  Atomic Kitten - Lil McClarnon, Tash Hamilton and Jenny Frost - completed their first ever UK tour, had number one single and album simultaneously and published their autobiography in 2002.  Hamilton even found time to have a baby.  But the group's journey to the top has been no pleasure cruise. Two years ago, Atomic Kitten were on the verge of fading into obscurity.  With disappointing debut album sales and their record company's axe hanging over them, they made a last-ditch bid for survival with the single Whole Again.  It topped the charts for four weeks and they haven't looked back since.  Atomic Kitten ended the year by releasing The Tide Is High (Get The Feeling) and double A-side The Last Goodbye/Be With You back-to-back.  Their schedule is punishing, but McClarnon says the pop star lifestyle is manageable.  ""I haven't had any other job so I can't compare it to a 9 to 5 job.  ""I left school to come to this job and I just accept this as a normal job.""  Despite their success, the group come across as down-to-earth. McClarnon says this has a lot to do with her home city.  ""That's a Liverpool thing. People are always offering to help each other, whether they know each other or not.  ""I was in Liverpool the other day and this lady was struggling with her bags and I offered to help her.""  Atomic Kitten's members seem to have a genuine affection for each other.  McClarnon says this is reflected in their Right Here Right Now video and DVD, which covers their excitement over Hamilton's pregnancy as well as videos and live performance footage.  Unlike Kerry Katona, who left Atomic Kitten after falling pregnant with Westlife singer Bryan McFadden's baby, the pregnant Hamilton was determined to re-join the group.  She was back at work just weeks after giving birth to son Josh in August.  McClarnon says the baby is gorgeous, but he hasn't made her feel broody: ""I don't want a baby of my own, thank you very much.""  Atomic Kitten's fans have supported them through thick and thin and McClarnon describes them as ""really nice people"".  ""Some people's fans are obsessive and it can be quite scary - they threaten each other and say: 'He's mine' or 'Don't speak to her', but our fans say: 'We like Atomic Kitten - if you do, that's cool; if you don't, that's your choice'.""  Much of Atomic Kitten's material appeals to the same audience who follow the Popstars and Pop Idols of this world.  McClarnon says she does not have time to watch TV talent shows, but she is not opposed to them.  ""I think it's good for the industry. The more the merrier. There are 40 spaces to fill in the chart every week.""  But unlike many of the wannabes who appear on these shows, McClarnon's heart was not always set on a pop career.  She started doing four A-levels, before dropping her studies to concentrate on the group.  ""When I was at school, all I ever wanted to do was law,"" she says.  ""My family are really career-minded. There were bookcases all over the house. It was like: 'Don't read that book, read this classic'.  ""I used to read really grown-up books - just so I could learn things and have a full-on conversation with my dad.""  Nonetheless, McClarnon intends to stick with the music business.  In 10 years' time, she imagines herself in the studio. ""Not performing, but writing at least.""  For the time being, McClarnon is looking forward to spending time with her family over the festive season.  Asked what her dream Christmas present would be, she says: ""A month off work.""  Somehow, Atomic Kitten's schedule is unlikely to allow it."
684,"The first ever castaway on Desert Island Discs 70 years ago was a man who not only annoyed Winston Churchill but also earned Adolf Hitler's enmity. So who was Vic Oliver and why isn't more known about him?  Vic Oliver was welcomed on to the first ever Desert Island Discs programme as a ""comedian, lightning club manipulator, violinist and comedy trick cyclist"", according to the surviving scripts.  That is quite an introduction.  Recorded in the BBC's bomb-damaged Maida Vale studio on 27 January 1942, the first ever Desert Island Discs aired on the Forces Programme at 20:00 two days later.  Oliver was a radio comedian, an Austro-American variety star and music hall bill-topper.  He was a brilliant musician who, while playing his instrument deliberately badly for laughs, led the way for comics Les Dawson and Victor Borge.  But behind the veneer of showbusiness and celebrity, his life story is as compelling as it is colourful.  Born Victor Oliver von Samek in Vienna, Austria in 1898, Oliver's fame peaked during World War II. His hit BBC radio series Hi Gang! was so successful that it had film and theatre spin-offs.  ""These programmes used to get bigger audiences than EastEnders does now so it's hard to get your head around how much they've been forgotten,"" says Dr Sian Nicholas, of the Centre for Media History at Aberystwyth University.  Oliver's original plan was to train as a doctor in Vienna but that was interrupted by World War I. It was rumoured that he had fought alongside Adolf Hitler, though Oliver chose never to address the subject.  Once the war was over, he concentrated on music and studied piano, violin and conducting at the Vienna Conservatoire before becoming assistant conductor at the Graz Opera House.  After emigrating to the US, he played piano in restaurants, bars and silent cinemas. The leap into comedy came when announcing a charity collection during the interval at a theatre where he was performing.  His English was still poor and he ended with the words: ""I shall now come down and go through you all.""  Laughter and large donations followed and a comedy star was inadvertently born.  A little while later, Oliver met a British stage dancer. Her name was Sarah Churchill and she had a very famous father.  The romance grew quickly and their love life was played out in the papers as any major star's would be today.  Oliver had become a big star in the US, both on radio and on the stage. He began to be offered work in Britain, travelling to star in Charles B Cochran's 1936 revue Follow the Sun.  And despite protestations to the contrary - Oliver told a newspaper in September 1936 that he was not the marrying kind - he had made plans for Sarah, 16 years his junior, to be his wife.  This news did not go down well with the Churchills.  ""The first time I saw my mother cry, I was absolutely overwhelmed,"" Sir Winston's youngest daughter Lady Soames told the Daily Telegraph in 2002.  ""I was 13 and she broke down in floods of tears because Sarah had run off to America to marry Vic Oliver. I realised then how much Sarah had hurt them.""  In letters released after Sir Winston's death, he referred to Oliver as ""common as dirt"", among other unflattering things.  Despite the Churchill family's initial objections, the couple married in New York on Christmas Eve 1936.  ""It would be such an unsuitable marriage,"" says Nicholas.  ""For Churchill, he was a nobody, an immigrant nobody, a Jewish nobody, an entertainer. The fact that he's made a lot of money from it didn't really matter. I'm not surprised that, in private, Churchill wasn't impressed at all.""  But it is believed that Churchill warmed to his son-in-law over time and, according to biographer Paul Addison, was distressed when it became apparent the couple would divorce.  The marriage was a difficult one and, in 1941, the couple effectively separated. Oliver filed for divorce in March 1945.  During the war, Oliver became a big star in the UK. It was in 1940, alongside film star couple Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon, that Oliver got his British break.  Daniels and Lyon had moved to London in 1935, working during the war by entertaining troops and factory workers - a task for which Daniels was later awarded the Medal of Freedom by US President Harry Truman.  From the idea of amusing people and keeping their spirits up during wartime, the idea for a radio show grew - Hi Gang!  ""That programme really put me on the map because, when everyone else was going to the country and sheltering, we were there every Sunday regardless of the Blitz,"" Oliver said in his only surviving interview, recorded in the 1960s.  ""We were there broadcasting to the people and spreading humour and good entertainment among them. The people have never forgotten it, that's when I took out British citizenship.""  The programme turned into a stroke of Allied propaganda genius. Hitler began his targeted bombing of London only months after it began.  While Nazi leaflets told of the flattening of London, Hi Gang! and its American stars remained in the capital and broadcast each Sunday for all 52 weeks of the year.  Oliver now had a prominence which, with his Jewish heritage, ensured his appearance in the Nazis' ""black book"". This list detailed those who were to be immediately rounded up in the event of a successful invasion of Britain.  Other names on the list included Noel Coward, Virginia Woolf and Paul Robeson.  ""At the very least, they would have been arrested and interrogated,"" says Gary Sheffield, professor of war studies at the University of Birmingham.  ""Very possibly for many of them, it could have been far worse.""  Oliver remarried in 1946 and continued to play in both big venues and appear on radio, even up to 1962 when he appeared in sitcom Discord in Three Flats. He died in Johannesburg on 15 August 1964.  From humble beginnings as a trainee doctor and then a theatre pianist, he had become one of radio's most recognisable voices in an era when variety stars were household names."
685,"Nigeria have failed to qualify for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations after falling to a 1-0 defeat in Egypt in their Group G match on Tuesday.  With just one game remaining and only the group winners to qualify, Nigeria cannot make up their five-point deficit to table-toppers Egypt.  Ramadan Sobhy's 65th-minute winner puts Egypt on the verge of qualification.  Egypt face Tanzania in June and will book their place in Gabon with any result better than a 3-0 defeat.  Nigeria won the Nations Cup in 2013 but have now suffered back-to-back eliminations in qualifying.  They threw everything forward to find an equaliser on Tuesday and came close when West Ham winger Victor Moses crashed a shot against the post in the 84th minute.  The match in Alexandria became a virtually all-or-nothing tie for Nigeria after Chad withdrew from the group on Sunday, citing financial difficulties, and all results from their matches were erased.  That left only three teams in Group G and in accordance with the rules of the Confederation of African Football only the winner would qualify for the finals.  Egypt have seven points with one match to play, against bottom club Tanzania, who have only one point but two games remaining.  To have any chance of qualification Tanzania would need to beat Egypt by a better scoreline than the 3-0 defeat they suffered in Egypt last June because head-to-head records would come into effect if the sides finished level on points.  Tanzania would still have to beat Nigeria in their final match in September."
686,"Almost 100 councils are known to have deposited money in Icelandic banks Local authorities have not been ""reckless"" in investing more than £840m with Icelandic banks that have now failed, the government has said. Deposits from more than 100 councils could be at risk, the BBC has learned. Ministers have promised ""case-by-case"" help in England and Wales, but say in Scotland the issue will be dealt with by the Holyrood administration. Gordon Brown said he was considering ""further action"", but the government is not offering to guarantee the deposits. The prime minister told the BBC that the Icelandic authorities' handling of accounts had been ""effectively illegal"" and ""completely unacceptable"". The government has frozen the UK assets of Icelandic bank Landsbanki, saying local authorities will benefit from this. They have failed not only the people of Iceland; they have failed people in Britain    But Iceland's prime minister, Geir Haarde, said it was ""not very pleasant"" to have laws designed to deal with terrorists used against his country. So far local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland have revealed that they have deposits worth £842.5m in total. The figure is £946.8m when investments by police authorities and Transport for London are added. Treasury Ministers Stephen Timms and Ian Pearson and Local Government Minister John Healy held talks with the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales. In a joint statement afterwards they said: ""Government and the LGA agreed that there is no evidence of recklessness by local authorities."" They added: ""We will judge what's appropriate on a case-by-case basis but, in previous situations, support has included helping local authorities restructure their financial priorities, providing additional expertise and capitalisation of expenditure."" James Purnell, the Minister for Work and Pensions, said the government's priority was to make sure that the services provided by local authorities were not affected by the collapse. ""We met with the Local Government Association and have been discussing this with councils, and we've agreed that we want to work together obviously to protect service levels - but this is a complicated situation. ""We've agreed that we will work with them over the next few days, and that is the right way of doing it, making sure we get a proper answer."" A Treasury spokesman said any assistance for Scottish councils would come from Holyrood, as local authority matters are devolved. According to Britain-wide figures acquired by the BBC, Kent County Council has the largest deposit, worth £50m. Nottingham City Council has invested £42m, while Transport for London has £40m deposited in one of the affected banks. The Conservatives have warned that town halls could face a ""massive financial shock"" and be forced into council tax hikes or cuts in local services. ""They are not going to find it easy in the short term,"" shadow communities secretary Eric Pickles said. He added: ""We need to look at the number of authorities that will be facing a cash-flow problem - some have their payroll on this, for others it's in terms of long-term investment."" The Lib Dems said the money at stake was ""essential"" for delivering local services and urged ministers to ""make clear"" how such funding would be protected. But councils say they have followed Treasury advice by investing surplus money to deliver the highest return for taxpayers. The LGA insisted all those involved had enough money to ensure frontline services should not be affected. But it wants the same protection for councils as has been given to personal customers of IceSave and other failed Icelandic banks.     "
687,"But Hamilton, 22, took third place to extend his lead to 14 points at the top of the drivers' standings with his eighth consecutive podium finish.  The Ferrari pair had too much pace for McLaren, with Raikkonen gaining the lead from his team-mate on lap 47.  Britain's Jenson Button came eighth to claim his first point of the season.  Defending champion Fernando Alonso, who started from 10th place after a gearbox failure in qualifying, battled his way to seventh place but still lost ground on his McLaren team-mate in the title race.  Alonso trails Hamilton by 14 points, with Massa a further three points behind and Raikkonen five adrift of the Brazilian.  Hamilton started from second on the grid but Raikkonen got off to a lightning start to overhaul the Briton at the first corner.  The Finn called on his superior pace again to get beyond Massa after his second stop on lap 47, overtaking him as he surged out of the pits.  ""Finally the start worked for me,"" said Raikkonen, who chalked up the 11th victory of his career in France, and his first since his opening day win in Australia.  ""I tried to push Felipe, I knew I would stop later and I managed to get ahead of him in the end.  ""I expected to go through difficult times and people always think you have lost it if you're not winning, so it's nice to win.""  Massa, who started on pole, had amassed a three-second lead over Raikkonen just before his second stop but his chances faded when he got held up by the back-markers.  ""I lost the race because of the traffic,"" said Massa. ""I lost too much time and speed, and that was the biggest problem for me.  ""But the car is great and we are happy to get the first one-two of the season for Ferrari.""  Hamilton made a sluggish start and, on an unusual three-stop strategy, never really threatened the Ferraris.  However, the British rookie showed his class when he jinked past Robert Kubica at the tight Adelaide Hairpin to regain third after his second stop.  It still says a lot for Hamilton that this result in Magny-Cours was his worst since he was third on his debut in Melbourne, following four successive runner-up places and back-to-back wins in Canada and the United States.  ""I didn't get off to the best start,"" said Hamilton. ""I don't know what happened, but I saw Kimi flying past.  ""But I'm still feeling fairly confident, and as long as we continue to have reliability, then I can look forward to my home race.""  His team-mate Alonso will also be looking for a fresh start after a frustrating French race.  The Spanish double world champion did well to battle back to seventh from 10th on the grid, his hopes stymied by a strategy based on the belief that he would be starting from the front of the grid.  But Alonso will nevertheless be disappointed to finish behind Nick Heidfeld and Giancarlo Fisichella after overtaking both of them during the race.  Button will go to next weekend's British Grand Prix with renewed confidence after claiming Honda's first point of the season, following extensive upgrades to his car.  The 27-year-old Briton said: ""It's a good result but we're not getting too excited yet as it is only one point, but it's a good base to build on.""  David Coulthard finished 13th for Red Bull while Anthony Davidson, the fourth Briton in the field, retired his Super Aguri after tangling with Vitantonio Liuzzi on the first lap.  Jarno Trulli's race also came to an end in an incident-packed opening lap when he ran into Heikki Kovalainen's Renault and sent him spinning.  That was bad news for Kovalainen, who finished 15th after qualifying in sixth.  It was a much better day for Kubica, who claimed fourth in his first race back after his high-speed crash in Canada."
688,"The court is almost certain to agree to the request at a hearing scheduled for August 1 and will appoint a supervisor to sell its assets.  The decision will spell the end for what used to be the country's biggest privately-owned oil firm.  Russian tax authorities and state-owned oil giant Rosneft are among creditors chasing Yukos for $17bn (£9bn).  Assets likely to be sold off include some of Russia's biggest refineries with Rosneft among those who could benefit.  Last week, Steven Theede quit as Yukos boss after denouncing the creditors' meeting as a ""sham"".  Yukos has struggled to survive after a series of tax demands totalling $27bn.  It says the demands are linked to a political campaign against its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently serving a long prison sentence in Siberia.  In 2004, the back tax bill led to Yukos' main Yuganskneftegaz subsidiary being expropriated by the government and sold off at auction - to be ultimately acquired by Rosneft.  The sale led to a legal challenge from Yukos when Rosneft floated on the London Stock Exchange.  In his resignation letter, Mr Theede said the creditors' meeting would be ""attended by those who are intent on destroying the rest of Yukos and taking its assets with no serious consideration being given to our financial restructuring plan"".  He added that he had been told court-appointed bankruptcy manager, Eduard Rebgun, had prepared a report for the creditors stating that a financial restructuring was impossible and the company should be liquidated."
689,"Police in India say they have arrested a Delhi-based journalist in connection with last month's bomb targeting an Israeli diplomat's wife in the city.  A freelance Indian journalist has been arrested and is being questioned, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said.  A motorcyclist placed a device on the embassy car in Delhi at a traffic light on 13 February. The blast injured four people, one seriously.  Israel blamed Iran for the attack but Tehran has denied the charge.  Indian officials have refused to point the finger while the investigations continue.  Syed Mohammed Kazmi was arrested on Tuesday after investigations showed he had been in touch with a suspect police believed might have stuck a magnetic bomb to the diplomat's car, the Associated Press news agency quoted Mr Bhagat as saying.  Police said they had searched Mr Kazmi's house over the past two days to gather evidence, but gave no details of what they found.  Reports said Mr Kazmi, 50, was an Indian citizen who worked as a journalist for an Iranian publication.  In the attack in February, the wife of an Israeli defence ministry official was seriously wounded. She underwent spinal surgery in the city before she was flown to Israel.  David Goldfarb, the spokesman for Israel's Delhi embassy, said the diplomat's car was close to the building on Aurangzeb Road when the explosion went off.  On the same day, a bomb underneath a diplomat's car in the Georgian capital Tbilisi was defused.  Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was behind both incidents.  But Iranian officials denied the claims as ""sheer lies""."
690,"Alastair Cook scored his first Test century since December 2007    Alastair Cook hit a career-best 139 for his eighth Test century as England batted out day five to draw the fourth Test against West Indies in Barbados. The tourists resumed on 6-0, 143 runs adrift, and the captains eventually shook hands after tea as England declared on 279-2, 130 runs ahead. England lost Andrew Strauss for 38 and Owais Shah for 21 before Cook hit his first Test century since December 2007. West Indies will go into the match in Trinidad knowing that they cannot be beaten in a series against England for the first time since 1998. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Having made 600-6 declared in the first innings, England will be disappointed that they were not in a position to push for the win going into the final day at Kensington Oval. But after the hosts declared on 749-9 in reply, Strauss' men can take credit for securing the draw so comfortably. With England's batting collapse on day four of the first Test still relatively fresh in the memory, West Indies knew victory was by no means beyond them if they could apply pressure on the tourists from the outset. Will the detractors who claim Cook should be dropped for getting out in the 50-60s be satisfied now he has got his century?    Their task was made more difficult by a flat pitch on which 1,355 runs had been scored at the start of play and that was showing few signs of deterioration despite the odd crack. But the hosts began in determined fashion and might have emerged with the wicket of Cook when the batsman was beaten outside his off stump on three occasions in the first over by Fidel Edwards. It was vital for England that openers Strauss and Cook weathered the early storm and they did so in cautious fashion amid some testing and disciplined fast bowling from Edwards and Daren Powell. The pair gradually grew in confidence, though, and went some way to calming any nerves as Strauss crashed Powell past point for four and Cook worked Edwards through the off side to the same effect. Having seen Cook struggle to cope with short-pitched deliveries in the first innings - he eventually fell on 97 with the last of several miscued hook shots - Edwards targeted the Essex left-hander with more of the same. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Cook issued a mixed response, offering a few poorly timed slaps before emphatically pulling Powell and Edwards to the rope. Strauss was making fairly serene progress but almost lost his partner when Cook's miscued slog-sweep off Sulieman Benn narrowly eluded Brendan Nash, who was running back from deep mid-wicket with the ball coming over his shoulder. Cook was also the beneficiary of poor West Indian field placing when a Benn delivery clipped his glove and looped into the air, only for the leg slip to be positioned too deep. Cook converted a fifty for only the eighth time in 28 attempts Keen to inject some much-needed life into the session, Windies captain Chris Gayle brought himself into the attack and the decision paid dividends. He almost had Cook run out by Benn before Strauss tried to cut a quicker delivery that was drifted into him but succeeded only in chopping the ball into his stumps. Shah was quickly into his stride with a blistering drive off Benn through cover, while Cook passed 50 for the 20th time by cutting Benn to the rope and helped the tourists to 115-1, a 34-run deficit, at lunch. But any thoughts England may have harboured of a comfortable start to the afternoon session were dashed when Shah, struck plumb on the toe, fell lbw to Benn in the sixth over after the restart. By that point Gayle had already sent down a devilish maiden to Cook that culminated with third umpire Daryl Harper rejecting a TV referral after Ryan Hinds took what West Indies felt was a catch off the bat. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Cook was having problems coping with Gayle and Benn but, fortunately for England, Pietersen was on hand to steady the innings and get the scoreboard ticking over again. That, in turn, seemed to relax Cook and after England overhauled West Indies' first innings total, he opened up with a flurry of well-timed boundaries off Edwards and part-time spinner Hinds. He crafted his way to 99, becoming the youngest Englishman to reach 3,000 runs in the process, but remained there for 10 nervy deliveries before passing 100 by working Hinds into the leg side for three. Cook was entitled to celebrate - his last hundred came against Sri Lanka in Galle on 18 December 2007 - but he would have been returning to the pavilion on 105 had Devon Smith held on at slip after Hinds coaxed an outside edge. Pietersen clubbed Hinds over long-on for a towering six and swept a single to bring up his fifty as England reached tea on 233-2, an 84-run lead. In a tame evening session, Cook passed the 127 he made against Pakistan in 2006 but just 46 runs were added in 13 overs before a draw was agreed.     "
691,"A French spokesman said it would provide logistics and intelligence to government forces.  A rebel spokesman, however, said France was not helping the CAR people, merely President Francois Bozize, who seized power in a 2003 coup.  The rebels have seized two towns during a two-week long offensive.  They are reported to be near the mining town of Bria, some 600 kilometres (375 miles) north-east of the capital, Bangui.  But the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR) rebels say they suspended their military activities, to give Mr Bozize time to invite them to talks on power-sharing.  ""We want to sit down at a table to discuss the nation's problems,"" UFDR leader Michel Djotodia told Reuters news agency.  But government spokesman Cyriaque Gonda said the rebels were merely seeking ""personal, egotistical interests"".  The towns of Ouadda-Djalle and Birao are near eastern Chad and Sudan's western Darfur region which have been plagued by violence and insecurity in recent years.  The CAR government says the rebels are operating from Darfur with the support of the Sudanese authorities.  It had earlier requested military help from former colonial power France to put down the rebellion.  The UFDR accused Mr Bozize, who won elections last year, of mismanagement and corruption.  The BBC's Joseph Benamse in the CAR capital, Bangui, says some of the rebels fought alongside Mr Bozize when he ousted Ange-Felix Patasse from power three years ago.  But they fell out with him when they were not given the pay they were promised."
692,"Ever since 9/11 and other terrorist attacks, increased airport security has been a burden air travellers have had to bear.  However, the people who run Belfast International Airport are taking steps to soften the image of security barriers and no-go areas.  The glass security wall separating passengers collecting their bags and those waiting to meet them, has gone.  There are now new ""no back-track gates"" for passengers.  The public viewing gallery that has been in mothballs for most of the past 10 years has been re-opened.  The gallery has ceiling-to-floor glass panelling and allows uninterrupted views across the airport apron and virtually the entire length of the runway.  Airports managing director Graham Keddie said it is unique.  ""We believe this is the only air-side viewing gallery in the United Kingdom.  ""People used to enjoy it, so we thought: 'Let's re-open it, let's use it again and let's put a bit more fun back into aviation,'"" he said.  The move is part of a £4m spend on refurbishment and a re-invigoration programme at the international airport that has taken a hit in recent years with the loss of Aer Lingus to George Best Belfast City Airport.  The international still handles more than four million passengers a year, with flights to more than 70 destinations.  This summer sees the arrival of Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic airline with a 747 jumbo jet holiday service to Florida.  It is good news for those air transport enthusiasts who plane spot for a hobby.  Lisburn sixth former Jake Lewis is a plane-spotter and a trainee pilot. He said reopening the viewing gallery was ""tremendous"" for spotters who usually spend their spare time standing out in all sorts of weather on the airport perimeter with rain-speckled binoculars and soggy notebooks.  ""Standing outside on the airport approaches gives a good view of planes coming into land but it doesn't afford you much of a view of them taxi-ing or taking off,"" he said.  ""The gallery reopening is a fantastic decision. It will given people the experience of what goes on from the moment an aircraft lands, taxis in and then takes off again.""  Luke also appreciates the fact that they will be indoors, with toilet and refreshment facilities.  Graham Keddie said that while there may be a bit of a benefit for the airport in terms of shopping spend and parking fees, this was not the main driver for reopening the gallery.  ""There are potential commercial upsides but, generally, we are doing it because it is simply a good thing to do,"" he said.  Rather than drive into the drop-off and pick-up zone, the hope is that people may decide to use the car parks and come into the terminal to either wave off their friends and relatives or watch them arrive from the public gallery.  Mr Keddie said it was about changing people's views.  ""The increased security measures did knock some of the fun out of flying and that's a lot of people's perception of it. We've got to change that, we've got to put the fun back into airports,"" he said."
693,"About 100,000 tonnes of sand has been earmarked to be taken from Montrose to shore up the Aberdeen beachfront.  However golfers in the Angus town say the proposal means that their erosion threatened course could be sacrificed.  The plan to take sand dredged from Montrose harbour in Angus up to Aberdeen was recently unveiled by the Scottish Executive.  Members at Montrose Golf Links argue one of the oldest courses in the world should be preserved.  One member, Montrose Central councillor Terry Wood, told BBC Scotland: ""The golf links is a great asset to Montrose.  ""The golfers believe the sand should be used to protect the golf course dunes.  ""They cannot understand why it is going to Aberdeen when it is needed to protect our own beach from erosion.  ""The Golf Links Trust would have to realign the course.""  The executive announced the funding package to bring in more sand after Aberdeen City Council officials warned that the city's sands could be lost in about 100 years, with homes and businesses destroyed by flooding.  The scheme would replenish Aberdeen with thousands of tonnes of sand from Montrose harbour.  The project was born after a previous funding scheme for the beach was turned down by the executive."
694,"General Motors and PSA Peugeot Citroen have announced a global alliance that will see them develop cars together.  Under the deal, GM will take a 7% stake in Peugeot, making GM the second biggest shareholder in the French firm after the Peugeot family.  The two firms will share engineering development and hope to launch the first common design by 2016.  They hope to save money by combining purchasing and by 2017 they expect to save some $2bn (£1.3bn) a year.  ""This partnership brings tremendous opportunity for our two companies,"" said Dan Akerson, GM's chairman and chief executive.  ""The alliance synergies in addition to our independent plans, position GM for long-term sustainable profitability in Europe.""  Both companies have been struggling in Europe.  Despite tough trading conditions Peugeot made a profit of 588m euros ($772m, £492m) in 2011, but that was down 48% on the previous year because of falling sales.  Philippe Varin, chairman of the managing board of PSA Peugeot Citroën said: ""With the strong support of our historical shareholder and the arrival of a new and prestigious shareholder, the whole group is mobilized to reap the full benefit of this agreement."""
695,"Ali Razini, head of Tehran's judiciary, was attacked by armed assailants while travelling in a car in the capital, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said.  It said a motorcyclist hurled a hand grenade at Mr Razini's car as it was leaving his office in the Imam Khomeini Judicial complex in central Tehran.  Mr Razini was ""slightly wounded"" in the leg and taken to a hospital, IRNA said. His condition is reported to be satisfactory.  The attack killed another judiciary official and injured Mr Razini's driver and two other people, according to Iranian reports.  Nobody has admitted carrying out the attack, but in the past the armed opposition faction Mujahideen Khalq has claimed responsibility for similar incidents.  Mr Razini, a hard-line conservative who heads the Special Court for the Clergy, is a key supporter of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The attack comes four months after Mohsen Rafiqdoust, a senior economic official, survived an attempt on his life.  In August, the former head of Iran's prisons, Assadollah Lajevardi, was killed by gunmen in Tehran's bazaar.  BBC Middle East Correspondent Jim Muir says activity by the armed Iranian opposition has apparently dwindled in recent months. The focus has instead been on a number of murders of liberal intellectuals and writers."
696,"These words have been spoken for over 30 years by Nicholas Parsons at the beginning of that ever popular BBC Radio 4 game show Just a Minute.  The rules are simple, their interpretation is not. Four contestants are given 60 seconds to speak on a subject shown on a card, but they have to do so 'without hesitation, repetition or deviation' from the theme. Only the word or phrase on the card may be repeated. For each correct challenge the challenger is given one point, an incorrect challenge and the person being challenged receives the point. There is also a point for speaking when the whistle blows, and a bonus of one for the incredibly difficult task of speaking for the whole minute.  The late Sir Clement Freud, former liberal politician, with a gastronomic speciality, a panache for multi-syllabic words and a trick of listing examples - sometimes challenged and sometimes given. Also the Grandson of Sigmund and the father of Emma.  The late Derek Nimmo who every week seemed to have a totally different family set-up to what he had before, and his close friends would often challenge him on these 'deviations' from the truth.  The late Peter Jones, probably better known to most Researchers as the voice of the book in the radio and television dramatisation of Douglas Adams's opus The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy. Peter was often the dithery character on Just a Minute but despite being the butt of many jokes, he was none the less a great exponent of the art.  Last but not least the late Kenneth Williams. Kenneth had a knack of turning one syllable into a three act play, and when things were going against him he would go into a strop about how he had come all the way from Great Portman Street - around the corner in London - to be here and it wasn't fair that everyone was picking on him  Of course Nicholas himself contributes greatly to the fun and entertainment.  With the death of Kenneth Williams there was a fear that the show would die with him, but this wasn't to be the case as new alternative comedians stepped in to continue the show's great oral traditions. Famous English comedian Paul Merton wrote to the BBC to ask to be on the show. He was a hit and so too Wendy Richards, Stephen Fry, Julian Clary and all the others who have followed suit. None of the guests find it easy all the time, and the show is loved all the more for it. Just a Minute is truly great radio entertainment and long may it continue in a 'televisual' age, to keep the art of conversation without 'hesitation, repetition or deviation' alive."
697,"The contest began as Mr Howard formally resigned by letter to Sir Michael Spicer, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs.  Five candidates have declared they will run for leader, with David Cameron taking over from David Davis as the favourite at the bookmakers.  Mr Howard stays on as caretaker until a replacement is named on 6 December.  Mr Howard first announced he would go shortly after the general election in May, when the Conservatives won 198 seats, a result he described as not good enough.  This week's annual party conference in Blackpool saw each declared candidate - Sir Malcolm Rifkind, David Cameron, Ken Clarke, David Davis and Liam Fox - put their case to members.  In his speech on Thursday, Mr Howard said he had feared the event going ""pear shaped"".  He added: ""Of course we need discussion and debate. But let's not be offensive about each other.  ""Let's not run down our party. Let's show we can elect a new leader without bitterness.""  Mr Davis remains the candidate with the most declared backers among MPs, but his campaign appears to have lost momentum after his conference was criticised in the press as ""lacklustre"".  Sir Malcolm Rifkind said his opponent must be ""very worried"".  But Mr Davis said he remained the frontrunner and that he would not be bowed by criticism.  The party's deputy leader, Michael Ancram, has revealed he is supporting Sir Malcolm's bid.  Meanwhile, David Cameron's team claims to be picking up more support from MPs, as an Evening Standard poll of 100 party members put him ahead of his rivals.  Conservative MPs will narrow the candidates down to two, before a vote by party members around the UK.  Mr Howard has not named his favoured successor.  Meanwhile, shadow culture secretary Theresa May has urged the Conservative Party to take ""radical action"" to win back women voters."
698,"Up to 35 people have died and 100 others have been injured after three trains were involved in a collision during morning rush hour in south London.  Two commuter trains carrying an estimated 1,300 passengers between them collided shortly after 0800 GMT at Clapham Junction - Europe's busiest railway junction.  A third empty train later ran into the wreckage killing some passengers who had survived the first crash.  Many passengers are still trapped as fire crews are cutting through the tangled carriages to reach them.  Emergency services have said the extent of the injuries mean some passengers have received operations at the scene.  At nearby St George's Hospital in Tooting staff are on emergency alert as coaches and ambulances wait to take those needing medical care to its new accident and emergency unit.  Passengers well enough to leave by foot, stood by the rail track and were described as ""visibly shocked and distressed"".  Many have been taken to a nearby school for first aid treatment.  Witnesses, unable to reach survivors because of the extent of the wreckage, have reported seeing appalling injuries.  They described how carriages were sent hurtling into the air before crashing back down again after the collision.  The accident took place when the 0718 from Basingstoke to Waterloo approached the junction.  Early reports indicate it was slowing for signals when the 0614 from Poole, travelling from Bournemouth due to track problems, ran into the back of it.  Experts have said this train would have been travelling at about 40mph.  Shortly afterwards an empty train leaving Clapham junction hit the wreckage.  British Rail has said initial reports indicate the crash was caused by signalling failures.  The Transport Secretary Paul Cannon is understood to be on his way to the scene of the tragedy."

700,"Slovenia 1-3 Paraguay Paraguay came from behind with a stirring second-half performance to beat Slovenia and clinch their place in the last 16. A double strike by Nelson Cuevas and another by Jorge Campos led Cesare Maldini's side to a second-round meeting with Germany but they had to do it the hard way. Paraguay had Carlos Parades sent off after only 21 minutes for a second yellow card after a nasty challenge on Milenko Acimovic. And Slovenia capitalised in first-half injury time to take the lead, after both goalkeepers had been tested. Tottenham-bound Acimovic made room for himself on the right and cut inside, his cross-cum-shot from a narrow angle slipped through Chilavert's fingers and into the net. Miran Pavlin tried a shot from the edge of the area which Chilavert was always going to get the better of. We had to fight a lot in this match      With their numerical advantage, Slovenia tried to get the second goal which would have well and truly ended Paraguay's chances. Acimovic hit the bar with a rasping shot while Milan Osterc also caused problems for Chilavert. But a couple of Paraguay substitutions in the second half by Cesare Maldini helped pave the way to their victory. After 66 minutes, substitute Nelson Cuevas, only on the field for five minutes, came in from the right to hit a left-footed shot past Dabanovic for the equaliser. 81 mins: Slovenia's Nastja Ceh is sent off    84 mins: Nelson Cuevas strikes again to send Paraguay into the second round   The goal seemed to boost Paraguay and seven minutes later, Jorge Campos got their second with a low shot from close range which beat Dabanovic. Chilavert then hit a tremendous free-kick which was tipped onto the bar. Worse was to follow for Slovenia when Nastja Ceh was sent off after 81 minutes. Three minutes later, Cuevas grabbed his second with a rasping drive which hit the underside of the bar before going in.    Slovenia: Mladen Dabanovic, Zeljko Milinovic, Doni Novak, Ales Ceh, Milan Osterc (Senad Tiganj 77), Miran Pavlin (Mladen Rudonja 40), Rajko Tavcar, Milenko Acimovic (Nastja Ceh 63), Amir Karic, Sebastjan Cimirotic, Spasoje Bulajic.

701,"Last night, preparing for this event, I googled ""knowledge"". I got 377 million hits – the first, inevitably, being a Wikipedia entry. Rather a good one too, cantering through Aristotle, Plato and Wittgenstein and making me wish I'd paid more attention at my university philosophy tutorials.  But the process – the search engine, the 377 million hits, the wiki entry – also reminded me forcibly of the necessity of the journey we've been on at the BBC for the last little while, the journey I want to share with you this evening.  Once upon a time knowledge was the privilege of the few.  Now, information has been democratised. That's undoubtedly a good thing. But it raises big questions for the BBC which has traditionally seen itself as one of the leaders of the national conversation about knowledge and what it's important to know.  In the world of the wiki and the intelligent search engine, that traditional belief has begun to seem rather presumptuous. Who needs the wisdom of Auntie when you have the wisdom of crowds?  What I want to argue tonight is that the BBC should be a leader in stating what it's important to know – not led by consumer need alone. In other words, our role as a public service broadcaster is not defined by what the audience already likes; we have a responsibility to establish bridgeheads into new worlds of knowledge on the audience's behalf. We should embrace the need to disseminate knowledge, but also play a role in defining the canon.  The traditional mission of the BBC, as defined by its first Director–General, John Reith, is ""information, education and entertainment"" – the three great pillars on which the BBC is built.  But when Reith came up with that formulation, he was surprisingly unhappy with the label he gave the second of those pillars – education.  More than 75 years ago he wrote that there was a problem with the word education.  The problem for Reith was that the word education conjured up visions, as he put it, of ""hard benches in schools ... cramming knowledge in order that certain tests may be passed.""  Reith said he wished someone would invent some other way of describing what he was really after in the BBC's education output – what he called: ""the sort of education which makes life so much more interesting and enjoyable than it otherwise might be.""  Well, I think there's a better label for the second of those three great pillars – knowledge-building.  What I want to talk about this evening is: how we define that mission; why we believe it is so central to the overarching BBC mission; and what we propose to do to ensure we deliver our knowledge-building mission in as compelling a way as possible for all our audiences – you could call it our Knowledge Manifesto.  First of all, the definition.  Knowledge-building includes education in the formal sense, but it covers a much wider field.  It includes not just the BBC's formal educational output – Blast, Bitesize, and so on – but a much wider range of output too, everything from Watchdog to Tommy Zoom to Tribe, the India Pakistan season, Imagine, Who Do You Think You Are?, Rain In My Heart, Manchester Passion.  But what binds it all together is a sense of enabling personal growth. A sense of audiences opening unfamiliar doors, and by doing so, enriching their lives, discovering their potential and setting out on the road to achieving it.  knowledge-building is not just about giving our audiences accurate and impartial information.  The truth is that in the 21st century we live under a permanent torrent of information. But most of us would willingly trade a Niagara of information for a cupful of understanding.  The BBC's knowledge-building mission is to offer audiences not just information, but a deeper understanding of the world we inhabit and an understanding, too, of the possibilities for all of us to engage with the world.  What this means for the BBC  Certain important things flow from this.  Firstly: knowledge-building is not just for a section of our audience. It is for all our audiences. This cannot be an elitist mission; it has to be a universal one.  Secondly: we cannot hope to enable our audiences to understand the world better unless, to the best of our abilities, we understand it better ourselves. And that implies a continued investment in specialist knowledge within the BBC.  How can you hope to open the doors to a greater understanding of, say, the world's religions unless you bring to the task real specialist knowledge of the world's great faiths?  Thirdly: the BBC's knowledge-building mission implies a certain degree of intellectual self-confidence among the BBC's programme makers. Not intellectual arrogance, but intellectual self-confidence, built on the firm foundation of that specialist knowledge and tempered with an openness of mind and a willingness to debate, to respond to the questions our audiences and experts raise.  Our knowledge-building mission implies a sense of the BBC as curator, as editor, as author – and as mediator and translator of the specialist world to the generalist world of our audiences.  That, in turn, implies the intellectual confidence and curiosity to identify areas of specialism – what it is important to know – and the passion to share those insights with our audiences, using the best communicators we have.  It also implies a willingness to explore with our audiences not just the easy options in the universe of knowledge, but some of the difficult areas too. Our audiences want us to surprise and delight them –and that applies just as much to knowledge-building as it does to any other genre.  When I worked in commercial television and tried to prod programme makers into unexplored areas, the answer would come back: Why? Do what works. Do what we know wins ratings. What we know they'll watch.  But natural history programming is more than beautiful polar bear cubs – however ratings-winning they are. European History, as many people have pointed out, is not just World War II. Science is not just medical miracles – it includes cosmology and genetics and physics and maths.  The hard sciences are aptly so-called – they are hard. But that doesn't mean we can't find ways to bring them alive for our audiences, find ways, as Reith put it, to turn them from the stuff of hard school benches into projects that make life so much more interesting and enjoyable. Take Science You Can't See on television – seeing it was hard, but enjoying it was not.  The BBC as a builder of literacy  As we start the new charter period, and with the formation of BBC Vision, I believe the BBC has an opportunity to instil real confidence about the future public value of knowledge. knowledge-building is one of the greatest sources of distinctiveness for the BBC in a world of increasingly commercial broadcasting. In the course of thinking about this we've involved some of the most passionate, best thinkers about knowledge-building – many of them are in the room tonight.  But what we also realised is that, apart from some regulatory stipulations, there's not much set in stone about the kind of knowledge output the BBC should focus on. There are all sorts of paths we could follow if we chose, some of them leading a pretty long way away from a mission for knowledge-building towards a consumer driven only future. We found that a bit alarming. But we went back to asking first principle questions – why do we do any of it?  I passionately believed we needed to draw up a statement of intent about these next ten years – a knowledge manifesto putting down some clear markers about what the BBC is for in this area, and why it's so important for the future.  It was a way of making sure that we don't rely on a kind of folk memory in defining what the BBC is for, or place over-reliance on a regulatory regime.  I wanted to set out clearly and boldly where knowledge-building sits in the BBC over the course of the current charter, to ensure we don't one day look up and find it's not there.  We can no longer rely on other broadcasters – even Channel 4 – providing external competition across the range of specialist factual. We have to rely on ourselves to retain these commitments. If you don't write it down, it might fall away.  In our discussions we came up with shorthand for all this: the idea of the BBC promoting literacy.  Now literacy can carry the narrow meaning of knowing how to read and write – and building those skills is certainly part of the BBC's knowledge-building mission and will continue to be so.  It means possessing enough knowledge of a particular subject to begin to feel at ease in that territory, to have the confidence to navigate unfamiliar paths, to feel sufficiently empowered to take part in the debate. Literacy opens the door to further experience and enjoyment.  Thus scientific literacy includes an understanding of the way our planet works; of the natural world and man's relationship with it; of the scientific method, and of the key technological advances that have shaped our world.  Civic literacy would include an appreciation of the major issues of the day, a working knowledge of the democratic process and of the justice system. It would encompass a sense of how business works, of citizens' rights and responsibilities.  Cultural literacy would include an understanding of key historical events; an appreciation of aesthetics; some comprehension of religious belief and of the key religious – and, indeed, anti-religious – themes in history.  What I might call ""life literacy"" would include knowledge of parenting, health and nutrition, of getting along with others, and making the most of the world of work and money.  And, of course, media literacy – enabling all our audiences to make full use of information technologies, to build skills in judging the accuracy and trustworthiness of content and to use it to create the communications they want.  Building literacy on this scale will not be easy.  But it is one of the main reasons the BBC exists.  Why we are doing this  The word everyone comes back to when they talk about what the BBC ought to offer is ""distinctiveness"".  Distinctiveness implies a particular way of doing things, but also a particular kind of heartland territory.  News is one of those BBC heartlands.  The BBC simply has to have a commanding reputation in the provision of news. If it didn't, then the BBC would no longer be the BBC.  In my view, knowledge-building is one of those BBC heartlands too. If the BBC doesn't have what Mark Thompson has called a commanding reputation in the field of knowledge-building, then it's not the BBC.  If you look at the BBC's Public Purposes as they are spelt out in the new charter, what strikes you is how central knowledge-building is to all of them. Not just ""promoting education and learning"". But sustaining citizenship; stimulating creativity; bringing the world to the UK; and so on, right through the list.  Through them all, like the watermark in a banknote, runs the indelible stamp of knowledge-building.  So we have a duty laid on us by Parliament to carry out our knowledge-building mission.  But that's not the only reason – or even the main reason – why I believe we should put our heart and soul into this mission.  No one gets out of bed because a regulator tells them to. We do what we do in this area because we believe profoundly it is the right thing for the BBC to do for its audience – and because knowledge-building lies deep in the DNA of the BBC.  Just for a moment recall the way factual television was virtually invented by the BBC and British programme makers – from roots in speech radio to the creation of BBC Two under David Attenborough's Controllership, setting out specialisms never before attempted by television. Britain has a great factual programme making history which is world class – we were lucky.  I want audiences to feel a greater sense of coherence about our knowledge output. I want it to feel less ad hoc. I want audiences to feel that we make the commissioning choices we do it because they reflect a sense of putting in place a missing piece of the intellectual jigsaw. Not just a declaration of intent – a mapping out of ambitions for the coming years. I like maps.  Take the canon of David Attenborough and the Natural History Unit – in particular the Life portfolio.  David and his teams have explored mammals, birds, plants and insects. Which is why reptiles – Life In Cold Blood – are coming soon – their turn in the sun this winter.  It may be that scaly creatures get pipped at the post by furry animals in ratings terms. But it isn't a ratings beauty parade – reptiles are part of the canon. There is a sense of completeness about this. It's about looking at the world in a way that adds up. It's not ad hoc and it's not all about ratings. It is about innovation yes, and stunning beauty but also deep research.  That's why, after Planet Earth, we're planning Frozen Planet, and a major anthropology series about human life on earth. Imagine if we applied this same thinking to our future history output.  This is the opposite of the ""do it because it works"" approach. This is not starting with an established format and working out how to refresh it, a little tweak here, a little tweak there, important though that is. It's starting with a hard question (what is it important to know) and trusting in the creative genius of programme makers to come up compelling answers.  For example – in what ways can we explore the information revolution that's exploding all about us? We definitely need to do more here. Or navigate our way round developments in the material sciences? Hard stuff. Or examine the nature of fundamentalism and faith?  I don't have the answers. But we can map out the areas.  But I do believe that expert programme-makers among BBC Vision's in-house producers and among the dedicated indies have the creative capacity to come up with the experts, the specialist knowledge and creative insights to make areas like these sing.  Not everything will change  In the world of the licence fee settlement we will have to make some tough choices.  We want all our knowledge projects to matter and that means greater concentration on what is important to know. That certainly doesn't mean a retreat from the kind of leisure or lifestyle factual that's deeply relevant to peoples' lives, and certainly not from general documentaries that can so brilliantly capture the texture of modern life in all its diversity. But it does mean a greater focus on serious factual – from arts, to history, natural history, business, science and religion – to consumer journalism.  However, individual subject areas are one thing. The task of innovation, enjoying the exploration of subjects, are essential qualities. Our portfolio of television channels is another.  I believe profoundly that BBC One, Two, Three and Four work exceptionally well together to offer our audiences a complementary service.  Taken together they provide a really solid foundation for our knowledge-building mission alongside CBeebies and CBBC.  BBC One: inspirational and accessible – programmes like How We Built Britain, Mountain and Palin's exploration of Eastern Europe.  BBC Three: public service broadcasting recreated for younger audiences hungry for relevance: programmes like Baby Borrowers or Kill It Cook It Eat It.  BBC Two: now as always, the very centre of the BBC's knowledge mission – a unique service at the heart of mainstream broadcasting but with serious factual programming at its heart. The power of the channel to deliver broad audiences to a demanding series such as Andrew Marr's History Of Modern Britain – or indeed Michael Wood's current Story Of India – proves that David Attenborough's vision of a broad-based, ambitious BBC Two remains as potent as ever.  But we can do more. If BBC Two is defined by the breadth and appeal of its factual offering, BBC Four has brought added depth and specialism, expanding hugely the range of subjects we can cover: look at the sheer diversity and richness of The Edwardians season earlier this year.  What the new Knowledge map adds is a whole new level of sophistication in the way the two channels can work together, using their distinctive positioning to give added scale to some of our biggest ambitions in knowledge. If you want an example, think of the kind of cross–channel impact we achieved with seasons like Abolition and India Pakistan '07.  In future, I'll be looking to the commissioners in Knowledge to be more strategic than ever in crafting projects and seasons that make the most of the special relationship between the channels – often with a shared landmark series at the heart – I would rather have one, special piece of content delivering impact on both channels than risk ending up with two indifferent programmes which were underfunded. Together, BBC Two and BBC Four will form a unique space in British broadcasting devoted to making the BBC's Knowledge mission really count.  So I see great value for the licence fee payer in all four of these channels, and in the rich scheduling mix they create. Adding to the factual and learning programmes and interactivity delivered by Cbeebies and CBBC.  And yes, I have said I would rather commission less but more impactful output than lose a channel from this rich mix.  The imperative to achieve greater impact means we can't afford to dissipate our effort over too wide an area at any one time. ""Fewer, bigger, better"", is a bit of a cliché, but it captures the general idea we're moving towards. And reducing current output should be kept in perspective – we will originate 1,600 factual hours in 2008-9 which is an increase of 36% when compared to the time before BBC Four and Three were launched.  So you can expect to see a concentration on some of the most distinctively ""BBC"" programme brands and genres.  As you know, the BBC is in the closing stages of a big reprioritisation exercise.  There is still plenty of detail to nail down and plenty of arguments to be had – as Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys have been demonstrating ... Indeed we toyed with commissioning them to do a follow-up to Badgerwatch called Two Rats In A Sack. But we couldn't square the format with our violence guidelines.  When the reprioritisation dust settles, some things will have changed. But as far as knowledge-building on television is concerned, this I can guarantee:  Horizon will be with us for a good while yet.     So will Watchdog and The Natural World and Imagine, The Culture Show, Storyville and Arena.     The Money Programme and This World will be there too.     We shall maintain the sweep of our natural history output and strands as well as widening our history coverage still further.     And we shall continue to take religion seriously with landmarks planned on the Bible, world religions and more.  We are developing a new science strand for peak time on BBC One. We will have major BBC Two authored landmarks from Andrew Marr, following on the acclaimed History Of Modern Britain – with more series being planned now beyond that. BBC Two will be home to new series on business – telling the story of the city and international capital, and of how technology is reshaping business. World religions are on the map, China will be big – and not just sport.  Arts: following on from Play It Again, embracing music education is an important theme and big projects on British music and literature are all in the works, and investment in expanding our understanding of architecture.  Many of these will be cross channel events – stretching from Children's to BBC One.  As I said, I like maps – they help provide the springboard for creative development and strategy without being prescriptive about the 'how'. But with less money we have to clearer about why we are doing this rather than that, because it is more purposeful.  There's a big map for science. We will be – from 2008 – broadcasting some of the biggest science landmarks we have ever done, covering some of the most important fundamentals of scientific literacy.  These will include, to coincide with the anniversary of the publication of Darwin's The Origin of Species:  Human Race – the first time we will have done the comprehensive story of what happened to homo sapiens as they came out of Africa; Human Planet – the biggest series we have ever done on anthropology and vanishing peoples; Life – the story of evolution on life on the planet.  As well as these landmarks, we will broadcast supporting programmes, all of this will be pan-platform, and we will deliver all of it in a way that can be used by schools.  And following up, in the following year, 2010, to mark the anniversary of the founding of The Royal Society, we will for the first time create a landmark series telling The History of Science (BBC Two) – the first time since The Ascent Of Man that the BBC has attempted to tackle this subject in a comprehensive and definitive way.  And incidentally, while I'm talking about science, here's something else I can guarantee.  As part of our knowledge-building mission, the BBC will continue to make a considered examination of the science and impact of climate change.  In doing so, we will not confuse a spirit of properly sceptical scientific inquiry with misinformation masquerading as scepticism. The subject is too important for that. And anyway we must leave room for the big debates around climate. If knowledge-building means anything it means giving the public the facts they need to take part in the debates that matter.  But this is not just about television.  The reason BBC Vision was created was to allow us all think more creatively about multi-platform opportunities.  The web enables us to fulfil our knowledge mission in new ways. As we all know, Web 2.0 offers boundless potential for engaging with our public not just as audiences but as partners in the creative process.  Project Earth is a case in point. This is a groundbreaking Web 2.0 initiative now in development – an online gateway enabling all our audiences to engage with the BBC's nature, wildlife and environment content.  You'll be able to find archive from the Natural History Unit, plus feeds from wildlife hotspots, field reports from production teams, and content related to big landmark series like Planet Earth and Springwatch.  Although global in reach, there will be a strong emphasis on British nature and wildlife. The project will also enable users to share their own experiences of nature through user generated content.  So, to return to the theme of ""fewer, bigger, better.""  Fewer is obvious. But if we aren't going to commission as many ideas, the ones we do commission better be the right ones – another reason for continuing to invest in a real depth of specialist knowledge at the BBC to help us steer ourselves to the right commissioning decisions.  Bigger implies bringing all our platforms and channels into play where appropriate – on TV, radio and the web – and working with external partners to increase the impact of what we do and to reach out further into communities and public life.  Increasingly we will use the web to build a rich legacy of broadband content for future generations. That programme on dealing with the terrible twos may not mean very much when you don't have a two–year–old – but what a great resource to be able to call on at the click of a mouse when the terrible two has arrived and is driving you to distraction. The BBC parenting website already gives us a glimpse of what is possible here for individuals, families and communities.  Better implies more imaginative, more creative, more exciting, more profound. In short, more distinctive.  Let me end by painting a picture of what the BBC's knowledge output will look like in five years time from our audiences' point of view.  Audiences feel the BBC is delivering to them knowledge and learning resources they can trust across a very wide range of knowledge genre, which they can use to engage fully and creatively with culture, society and others.  Some of this is inspirational. All of it can lead to a deeper understanding – and the spread of channels offer different approaches to understanding.  Alongside the channels, our web output offers a resource audiences can return to time and again – and to which they can contribute their own insights.  Together, the BBC and its audiences will embark on a journey of understanding.  Our ambition is to put knowledge at the heart of the BBC offer; to make clear its massive contribution to the BBC's public purposes; and to reassert its centrality to the BBC–ness of the BBC and most importantly to the audience and their lives.  Thank you for listening."
702,"She appeared at an event to promote cycling despite the corporation telling her agent she should not take part.  Conservative London Assembly member Brian Coleman said the Labour mayor had turned the event into a ""political rant"", breaking BBC impartiality rules.  But Ms Huq's agent, Jonathan Shalit, said she had attended ""with goodwill"".  The BBC has apologised to Mr Coleman, adding that this was a ""one-off incident"".  Deputy director-general Mark Byford wrote to him, saying: ""The BBC had turned this down on the grounds that it would be unsuitable for her and Blue Peter.  ""It was felt that the BBC and the programme should not be linked with anything that might be construed as campaigning, and that this campaign potentially fell into that bracket.""  He added that Ms Huq's contract had been re-written, giving the BBC an ""absolute veto over what she can and can't do"".  Mr Coleman said Mr Livingstone had used the event to accuse the Tories of pursuing ""pro-car"" policies.  He told The Times: ""The launch became a political rant. It is unforgivable for the BBC to allow the Blue Peter name to be lent to a political event.""  Mr Coleman later said he accepted the BBC's apologies.  Mr Shalit said: ""It is totally not the BBC or Konnie's fault. It is quite correct the BBC said no to it but I wasn't aware of that.  ""The BBC probably realised it was a political event when I didn't. All Konnie was asked to do was support a get-fit campaign. It was done with goodwill. The Tories have made this into a political event.""  Mr Livingstone's spokesman denied there had been a ""political rant"", adding: ""There was no party political element to Konnie Huq's involvement in the launch.""  He added that, during the press conference, Mr Livingstone had ""referred briefly"" to the amount of money spent on cycling by Barnet Council, of which Mr Coleman is a member.  Mr Livingstone also mentioned that Mr Coleman had run up a £10,000 taxi bill, the spokesman said, adding that this had been a ""moment of jokey banter"".  He said: ""It was certainly not in any way party political - no political parties were even mentioned.  ""The Hovis London Freewheel is a new event to promote cycling and London and supporting this event cannot in any reasonable view be regarded as party political."""
703,"Pinsent replaced Jan Zelezny on the IOC's Athletes' Commission in 2001 while the three-time Olympic javelin champion concentrated on his training.  But the Czech athlete regained his place after an election in Athens.  The other successful candidates were Frankie Fredericks, Hicham El Guerrouj and Rania Elwani.  Pinsent will now relinquish his IOC role after the Athens Games.  The Olympic champion's failure to keep his place on the IOC will not affect London's chances of winning the 2012 Games, according to the bid team.  ""This is in no way a blow to the bid,"" said Mike Lee, the communications director for London 2012.  ""Matthew has been totally focused on his preparations for Athens and on winning his fourth gold medal.  ""Because of this, he's not been able to actively campaign for re-election. This has obviously affected his vote.""  Although IOC members are not allowed to vote for their own cities as hosts, they are able to lobby their colleagues.  The four elected athletes will serve as IOC members for the next eight years, taking to 19 the number of sportsmen and women on the commission.  Namibian sprinter Fredericks, who is retiring after these Games, is a four-time silver medallist, while El Guerrouj ended his long wait for a 1500m gold in Athens.  Ex-swimmer Elwani competed in three Olympics before taking up a number of high-profile political positions in domestic and international sports."
704,"The Tories want an inquiry into the way chief police officers were asked to lobby MPs for a new 90 day limit.  MPs on the Commons home affairs committee may now examine the issue.  Home Office Minister Hazel Blears said it was ""entirely appropriate"" for police to make the case for detaining terror suspects for up to 90 days.  The plan was rejected by MPs on Wednesday in Tony Blair's first defeat as prime minister.  Conservatives Stephen Dorrell and Peter Lilley have tabled a parliamentary motion condemning ministers for ""embroiling them in politics"".  ""The government asked chief police constables to lobby their local MPs in a way that I think runs the risk of politicising the police,"" said Mr Dorrell.  Mr Lilley said: ""Every chief constable knows their job is up for re-selection in the next year or so. That puts great pressure on them.""  The motion has been signed by 11 other Conservative MPs, two DUP MPs, Angus McNeil of the SNP and Lib Dem John Hemming.  Ms Blears denied the police had been playing politics by lobbying for 90 day detention, saying they had only being providing their expert advice.  She told BBC2's Newsnight. ""It is entirely proper that the police were there to make their case and for Parliament to considered it.  ""Certainly, as a Member of Parliament I would want to have the benefit of the best professional advice I could get before reaching my decision.""  The home affairs select committee is also to investigate the role of chief police officers in the 90 day row.  Committee chairman John Denham said he did not think the police were necessarily being 'politicised'.  ""It is worth remembering this was not originally a government policy,"" the Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.  ""It was a policy from the association of chief police officers. I don't think it is a surprise that they organised to try and get their policies through.  ""It is very common for police officers to lobby members of parliament, including opposing government policy.""  Mr Denham said his committee would be looking into the police's case for extending detention - but MPs would be free to raise the issue of alleged politicization.  Conservative committee member Richard Benyon said he thought the MPs should tackle the issue but still had to set the terms for their inquiry.  ""If the home affairs select committee is not the right vehicle then we need to find other means of finding out who instigated this co-ordinated campaign,"" he said.  ""Was that a suggestion from any special adviser or from 10 Downing Street? There is enormous anger about this.""  Shadow home secretary David Davis also voiced his concern, telling Newsnight: ""I think the position of the chief constables looks a little political.""  Ahead of Wednesday's vote extending the detention time limit from 14 to 90 day, Andy Hayman, head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, wrote a memorandum arguing the case for the plan.  He also joined Home Secretary Charles Clarke to meet Labour backbenchers and was interviewed on television and radio.  Conservatives say MPs also received telephone calls, emails and letters from chief constables.  Sussex chief constable Ken Jones, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) on counter-terrorism, wrote to police chiefs around the country last Friday.  He asked them to make sure all of their MPs were informed about the argument for 90-day detention.  An Acpo spokeswomen said: ""Of course we were contacting MPs. They needed to be informed before they made a decision.  ""One of the purposes of Acpo is to give a professional view when we are asked for one."""
705,"The Chrysalids, written in 1955, was John Wyndham's third major novel and his most unusual. The plot and themes are an almost total inversion of his usual style and concerns, but for all this it is considered by many to be his most consistently successful book. (In some countries it is also known as Re-birth.)  David Strorm, Wyndham's narrator, is a young boy growing up on a prosperous farm. He occasionally has strange dreams but thinks of himself as normal. He thinks his friend Sophie is normal, too, until he accidentally discovers her secret - a secret so terrible that her father considers killing him when the discovery occurs. Sophie has six toes on each foot.  David does not immediately connect this with the truths of the religion his community, and especially his father, cling to fanatically. Many years before, the Old People had a marvellous but decadent civilisation - and for their sins, God sent a terrible Tribulation upon them, turning vast areas of the world into poisonous black glass deserts and cursing the impure with mutant offspring. Now, all such deviations are ruthlessly hunted down in David's country, Newf (implied to be the remains of Newfoundland in Canada). Mutant crops are burnt, mutant livestock slaughtered, and mutant humans sterilised and exiled to the Fringes, border country where mutations run unchecked and mutant tribes eke out a miserable existence.  Sophie's mutation is discovered by the authorities and she is exiled. David has other concerns, however; he can share his thoughts with a small group of others, through a process similar to telepathy. His uncle, a broadminded ex-sailor, warns him that this too will be considered a mutation and if they are discovered their fate will be even worse than Sophie's. As David and the others grow up, they have plenty of demonstrations as to how cruel their society can be...  But, the suicide of one of their number after a failed marriage to a norm notwithstanding, the telepaths reach adolescence in relative safety. Then David's baby sister Petra reveals herself to be a colossally powerful telepath capable of throwing a thought halfway round the world or placing the others under a kind of psychic compulsion. After one such incident, suspicion falls upon David, Petra, their cousin Rosalind, and two of the others.  The government moves to try and arrest all five simultaneously but the attempt is bungled and David, Petra and Rosalind flee for the Fringes with hunting parties at their heels. Petra reveals she is in communication with a colony of other telepaths on the distant isle of Sealand (implied to be New Zealand). Due to the value of Petra's natural talent an aircraft is sent to rescue them.  The fugitive trio are captured by Fringes mutants, whose leader is David's uncle - who but for his mutation would have been the heir to the family estate. Meanwhile a norm army has been sent after them with Michael, leader of David's group of telepaths, riding with it to provide them with information. David and Petra's father is also a willing participant in the hunt.  David is expelled from the camp - the chieftain wants Rosalind, as unlike the other Fringes women she has not yet been sterilised - but is rescued by Sophie. Wanting her place as the Chieftain's woman back, she rescues Rosalind and Petra. The norm army arrives and a pitched battle is fought with the mutants near the trio's hiding place. David's father, his uncle, and Sophie are all killed in the fighting.  The Sealander aircraft finally arrives and dispatches the survivors with a weapon of their own. Their leader impresses upon the telepaths their responsibilities to their own kind, and the truth that they and norms cannot coexist. David, Petra and Rosalind depart in the aircraft for Sealand, but Michael remains behind to rescue the last member of the Canadian group.  The Chrysalids is an almost total inversion of John Wyndham's usual style and techniques - but, oddly, it remains concerned with all his typical themes and is often cited as his finest novel. A few recognisable elements from the earlier Triffids and Kraken linger on: this is a first person narrative, driven by desperate moral conflict, and essentially concerning the rise of a new hive-minded force which threatens to dislodge normal humanity from dominance.  But here the similarities end: rather than the usual contemporary English setting, the novel takes place in post-apocalypse Canada. Civilisation has already fallen and the characters are essentially fighting for control of the ruins. And unlike in other novels, here Wyndham's narrator takes an active role in the story - he is central to events, rather than merely observing or being caught up in them as elsewhere. There are other unfamiliar narrative elements - the last section of the book is concerned with a chase-and-capture plot as the fugitives are pursued into the Fringes. There is also the romance which develops between David and Rosalind, although this mainly happens 'off-screen' (and given the purplish prose Wyndham occasionally uses to describe the relationship this is by no means a bad thing).  More significantly, the archetypal Wyndham character of the sage is almost totally absent - unless one counts the practical wisdom of David's Uncle Axel or the ruthless ideology of the nameless Sealander woman. And, uniquely, the hive-mind in this novel is not an unknowable, implacable foe but the protagonist and his friends. The behaviour of David's monstrous father and the other norm authority figures is quite sufficiently horrific to ensure that the telepaths seem sympathetic. (For all this, though, the scholar Roland Wymer has argued that there are disturbing aspects to the Sealanders more reminiscent of an insect hive than the traditional libertarian utopia.)  One of the key themes of this novel is that of the different branches of the Strorm family in conflict - David and Petra with their father, their father with his mutant elder brother, and also with his brother-in-law Angus. This mirrors the strife between the different factions of humanity (norms, mutants and telepaths) that is at the novel's core. There is also the traditional Wyndham concern with the ruthlessness necessary in the struggle to survive. This is coupled, however, with an ambivalent attitude to racial purity: Uncle Axel suggests that the norm obsession with the rooting out of mutations is ultimately mistaken. It's an odd inconsistency given the theme of the novel, unless the suggestion is that the norms are ultimately bound to be replaced by their more evolved heirs, and nothing can prevent this.  Another major theme is an implicit criticism of religion, previously seen in Day of the Triffids. Here it is equated with the oppressive and unenlightened regime enforced in Newf, which is arguably presented as a religious dictatorship.  The Chrysalids represents a major development in Wyndham's technique and ambition after the time-marking Kraken Wakes. The novel functions superbly on every level save one: the actual presentation of the telepathy David and the others share is rather pedestrian and doesn't really reflect how David himself describes it to others in the novel. Clearly, Wyndham's deceptive conventionality of style - his great strength as a stylist - didn't allow him to explore the nature of psychic communication in a more experimental fashion. This remains a small blemish on what is arguably Wyndham's masterpiece."
706,"More than 100 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze at the B&Q warehouse in the Sprucefield Retail Park on Sunday night.  There was extensive damage to the rug department and smoke damage to the rest of the property.  Police said that initial investigation indicated the fire was caused by a genuine incendiary-type device.  The fire was found at about 2300 GMT on Sunday when staff saw flames in the carpet and rug section.  At one stage 20 fire engines attended the blaze, which took eight hours to bring under control.  Assistant Divisional Fire Office Alister Rooney said the size of the premises made locating the seat of the fire a challenge.  ""The size of the place is the first problem we encountered. We had to locate the fire,"" he said,  ""This huge store was just full of smoke and it was no easy task to find the fire.  ""We had 30 firefighters wearing breathing apparatus who were committed into the building to locate and extinguish the fire.""  Mr Rooney said sprinklers had saved a huge portion of the building.  Police are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the blaze.  He said: ""Those responsible have absolutely nothing to offer the people of this province and are only seeking to drag us backwards.  ""In the run up to Christmas, this is a serious blow to the local economy.""  Meanwhile, forensic tests have been carried out at the scene of a fire in Londonderry.  The blaze on Sunday morning at the Carpetrite store at the Crescent Link complex, caused £100,000 worth of damage.  It was so fierce that it took 40 firefighters three hours to bring it under control.  Police said that a ""detailed and thorough"" examination was carried out and the cause of the fire is, as yet, ""undetermined"".  A number of tests were carried out, the results of which are awaited."
707,"Robert Ashman's life seemed far detached from the image of a crazed sword-wielding attacker.  He was from a middle-class family, his father a war veteran who served in Saigon. He was married, had a good job and two children.  But redundancy, bankruptcy and divorce eventually triggered a mental disorder that transformed him into a killer.  Ashman and his wife, Beryl, bought a £115,000 six-bedroom mansion in the affluent spa town Cheltenham in May 1990, which they renovated before moving in with their daughters, Kirsti and Lucy.  But after the former drainage engineer lost his job with the Severn Trent water company, the move sparked a spiral of debt and mental illness for Ashman. Lloyds Bank started repossession proceedings, several loans failed to materialise and his marriage ended in 1996, after 25 years. With debts reaching £41,000, Ashman was heartbroken by the realisation that he would not be able to give his daughters the future he would have wished. He visited Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones' Friday night surgeries at least 50 times over eight years in a bid to persuade the MP to campaign on his behalf. But when he decided to strike back at the system which he blamed for robbing him of his job, his home and his family, Mr Jones and his assistant Andrew Pennington were on the receiving end. Friends, colleagues, and staff from the MP's office who had listened repeatedly to Ashman's money worries, had dismissed him as obsessive, but not dangerous.  Psychiatrist Dr Jacqueline Short said Ashman suffered from delusions and a persecution complex which led him to believe he was the victim of conspiracies in the criminal justice and political systems. When Ashman started to believe Mr Jones was a part of that conspiracy, he snapped. Dr Short said losing your house, job and marriage did not necessarily lead to such a breakdown. ""But if you are vulnerable, especially when they are combined, that can precipitate mental illness."" Ashman had a history of a volatile temper. In May 1992 he broke the ribs of a council tax collector after being served a summons for non-payment. Ashman escaped jail after Mr Jones wrote a reference in his defence saying the attack was out of character.  Mr Jones, his hands still scarred from the sword attack he suffered, now admits the character reference was a mistake. Ashman's temper also emerged when a burglar broke into his home two years later. Ashman pulled a penknife on the thief and told him: ""If you try anything, remember I have got this."" He even went on the Kilroy television chat show after the burglary and urged others to take the law into their own hands. Later, his volatility reached a climax when he entered Mr Jones' office and pulled out a 3ft curved Samurai sword."
708,"Southlake Moor on the Somerset Levels has been restored to a floodplain after £350,000 of investment.  The aim is to make Southlake Moor more wildlife friendly and allow safe control of flood waters during winter.  It is part of an £8m project by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board (IDB) to restore ten floodplains in Somerset.  The work has involved building and upgrading sluice gates, watercourses and culverts which manage water levels and prevent rivers from overflowing.  Floodplains on the levels have been drained for generations for agricultural use.  In recent years, work has been carried out by the drainage board, the Environment Agency and conservation charities to restore this land to its natural state to promote biodiversity and prevent flooding.  Nick Stevens, chief executive of Parrett IDB, said the levels were used for storing water when rivers are unable to cope with the volume of water.  It is then allowed back into the rivers when the river levels start to go down.  He added: ""Although in itself Southlake doesn't provide huge quantities of water - we are talking of many millions of cubic metres of water that needs to be stored - Southlake proves piece in the jigsaw.""  Southlake has the potential to store 1.2 million cubic metres but at the moment holds 600,000 cubic metres and the floodplains across the levels have a potential to store millions of cubic metres of water.  The restoration work has been welcomed by the conservation charity, RSPB.  Richard Archer, RSPB Somerset and Severn Estuary conservation officer, said: ""Standing on Burrow Mump, it's fantastic to once again see these meadows flooded and alive with thousands of waterbirds.  ""Returning land to favourable condition also has benefits for those that farm the area as well as local communities who can now enjoy an amazing new wildlife spectacle.""  The Parrett Internal Drainage Board has carried out the work in conjunction with the Environment Agency, which is responsible for a number of sluice gates and Natural England which owns the land."
709,"Manchester City have announced plans to increase the capacity of their ground from 48,000 to about 61,000.  The Premier League club will add a third tier behind the goals of the Etihad Stadium's North and South stands, subject to planning approval.  Tiers will include about 6,750 seats, with fans able to join a season ticket waiting list for the seats next week.  The club aim to submit the plans next month and hope work will start on the project in February.  City said the work would not impact season ticket holders attending home matches. The tiers are expected to be completed for the beginning of the 2015/16 season.  The team has played its home fixtures at the stadium since 2003.  A club spokesman said: ""Should the club's exciting plans receive planning approval, City's home, which this year celebrates its 10th birthday, is set to be even more visually dramatic"".  The stadium initially had a capacity of 38,000 when it was built for the Commonwealth Games, which were held in Manchester in 2002.  The planned expansion would see the stadium become the second largest in the Premier League, behind neighbours Manchester United's Old Trafford home which holds more than 75,000."
710,"Some $2.9bn (£1.8bn) is missing from the accounts of the Libyan sovereign wealth fund, the official tasked with tracking down Libya's foreign investments has told the BBC.  Mahmoud Badi said investigations had found ""misappropriation, misuse and misconduct of funds"" at the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA).  The LIA has total funds worth about $70bn.  It was set up in 2006 by Saif al-Islam, one of Muammar Gaddafi's sons.  LIA has overseas investments such as stakes in the Italian bank UniCredit, Italian football club Juventus and Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times.  Mr Badi was formerly a senior civil servant in the Gaddafi regime. He is understood to have been appointed to the LIA on an interim basis by Ali Tarhouni, who is the minister in charge of financial and oil affairs for the rebel National Transitional Council.  ""We are going to dig for the truth, we need the help of expert people, we will use expert people,"" said Mr Badi, speaking to the BBC at LIA's offices in London.  ""We will use all available means, we will contact all respectable institutions who were attached to these funds.  ""And they have to make it up to the Libyan people, they have to bear their responsibilities.""  Earlier on Friday, the head of the Libyan Stabilisation Team at the National Transition Council said it would take at least 10 years to rebuild the country's infrastructure.  Libya's infrastructure was in a poor state even before the revolution due to ""utter neglect"", the head of the team, Ahmed Jehani, told the BBC."
711,"Arsenal took the lead against the run of play when Gilberto Silva nodded in at the far post, but Watford hit back when Tommy Smith lashed in a shot.  Watford tested a struggling Arsenal while having keeper Ben Foster to thank for keeping out shots from Emmanuel Adebayor and Justin Hoyte.  Arsenal pressed for a late winner and Van Persie obliged with a curling shot.  There had been enough endeavour and enterprise about Watford's start to suggest a goalscoring threat and Arsenal were quickly forced on to the backfoot.  The Hornets looked especially menacing from set-pieces and Arsenal's young and inexperienced defence looked suspect if the home side could find the quality to take advantage.  But, despite their early pressure, Watford had Foster to thank for keeping them level as he twice saved angled strikes from Van Persie after Arsenal counter-attacks.  A similar Van Persie effort went agonisingly wide before Watford striker Ashley Young's eyes lit up as a clear sight of goal opened up in front of him.  Young's shot was blocked by the last-ditch sliding tackle of Gilberto, who then raced up the other end to nod in at the far post after a corner was flicked on by Kolo Toure.  Watford refused to buckle and continued to attack, a looped Young effort forcing Gunners keeper Jens Lehmann to scramble across his goal and palm the ball away.  The resilience of the home side brought a deserved equaliser with Hameur Bouazza's surging run and deflected cross being powerfully lashed in by Smith.  The Hornets were applauded off at half-time but almost let themselves down shortly after the interval.  Tomas Rosicky left Watford right-back Adrian Mariappa trailing as he burst through on the Watford goal only to have his stabbed shot blocked by Foster.  There were signs of panic from Arsenal as the game wore on, before the visitors finally started to exert some pressure with flashes of their familiar fluid football.  Foster again had to come to his side's rescue when he spread himself to keep out an Adebayor shot with his legs and then palmed away an angled Hoyte drive.  Arsenal scented a win and Julio Baptista and Adebayor shot just wide as the visitors produced a late surge.  Watford struggled as Arsenal upped their game and eventually caved in when substitute Theo Walcott released Van Persie, who cut in from the right and curled a shot in at the far post for the winner.  ""We lose a player who was outstanding in Hameur Bouazza and it turns the game in many ways.  ""We will just keep going, get that momentum and string some results together and make it exciting.""  ""He works very hard and in this game created more chances in the first half. In the second he had one and scored.  ""He did it in a great style and there is some Bergkamp in there in the way he finishes - he is open-footed, strikes it cleanly and makes quick decisions."""
712,"TV presenter Chris Packham has written an open letter to Ant and Dec asking them to end ""abuse of animals"" in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!  The duo preside over the show's ""bushtucker trials"", in which contestants eat live insects, or endure close encounters with creepy crawlies.  Writing in the Radio Times, Springwatch presenter Packham described the trials as ""out of date"" and ""silly"".  The award-winning ITV series is set to return on Sunday.  Packham said that teaching young viewers that killing for ""exploitative 'entertainment' is acceptable"" is ""a shame that I imagine neither of you will want to take to your graves"".  He wrote: ""The problem is that animals such as snakes, spiders, crocodiles, rats and many invertebrates are already misunderstood and thus unfortunately vilified, despite the incredibly important roles they play in the world's ecosystems and our lives.  ""By orchestrating a fear of them among your contestants, I'm afraid you're reinforcing and exaggerating a terrible ignorance and intolerance of these remarkable animals.""  Packham was also dismissive of the programme's use of consultants to advise on animal welfare, saying: ""I can guarantee that some animals are harmed during production, because they are fragile or easily stressed. Or simply killed, as they are in your bushtucker trials.""  He added: ""The show has been running for years now. Surely it's time for it to mature, for you to accept that, as pillars of the British broadcasting community, you should put an end to this inhumane, embarrassing and destructive aspect of an otherwise great show.""  Packham also said the eating of invertebrates and animal body parts such as eyes and testes made a mockery of the needs of those from some cultures who have no choice but to eat such things.  ITV responded to Radio Times, saying: ""Ant and Dec are the presenters of the show, and as such are not involved with the formatting of the trials, which are devised by the show's producers.  ""ITV takes animal welfare very seriously and expert handlers are on hand at all times.""  Packham is not the first person to criticise the show's treatment of animals.  DJ Tony Blackburn, who won the first series in 2002, said in 2012: ""I wouldn't have done the show if I'd had to eat bugs. They supplied Tofu for me. I don't like the way they treat creatures. I think it's cruel.""  ITV was also fined £1,660 in 2010, after contestants Gino D'Acampo and Stuart Manning killed and cooked a rat as part of the show.  The RSPCA in New South Wales, Australia - where the reality show is filmed - said it was ""not acceptable"" an animal had been killed as part of a performance.  D'Acampo and Manning were originally charged with animal cruelty themselves, but the charges were dropped after ITV admitted responsibility."
713,"The Olympic champion had earlier failed to beat Arnaud Tournant's kilometre record by just 0.005 seconds at the 333m Alto Orpavi velodrome in La Paz.  But the four-time world champion got back on his bike and set out to break Arnaud Duble's previous record of 25.850secs from a flying start.  It is the end of an era for Hoy, who will no longer ride the kilometre after it was withdrawn as an Olympic event.  After his world record ride, Hoy said he was relieved to have achieved something at the highest velodrome in the world.  ""It was an amazing feeling, I just felt as though I was flying down the back straight. It was a dream ride, everything about it was perfect,"" he said.  ""Part of the battle was trying to get the right weather conditions. It was 25-26C, the wind dropped for 10 minutes and the opportunity was there.  ""After the disappointment of the kilometre, I wanted to go home with something and I'm happy for all the team that I've set this record.  ""I don't plan to go for the kilo again. I gave it everything and it was so frustrating to miss it by that little margin, but that's sport and you have to accept it.""  The 31-year-old had originally travelled to La Paz, which is located in the Andes at an altitude of 3,658m, with the intention of challenging the kilo mark.  His first attempt was 59.103s before he missed out agonisingly with a second attempt of 58.880s.  Hoy, who set the sea-level world record of one minute 00.711s when winning gold in Athens three years ago, was well ahead of Frenchman Tournant's times on the first two of three laps but lost pace on the third.  You can share Chris's Bolivian adventure in a BBC documentary to be shown on BBC Scotland on 3 June."
714,"Until ""The Virgin Suicides"", the mere mention of Sofia Coppola caused cackles for it was she, in ""The Godfather Part III"", directed by her father Francis, who looked as if she was trying to get her lines in the right order while reading them off Al Pacino's forehead. So excruciating an experience was this for her (and us) that ""The Godfather Part III"" doesn't even appear on her CV.  Just as Saab and Skoda have been reinvented as classy car companies, so Ms Coppola, as director of ""The Virgin Suicides"", has comprehensively replaced our laughter with huge admiration. An always impressive tale of teenage insecurity, deprivation, angst, and lust, it is way ahead of standard-issue American teen tales in both its intelligent ambition and subtle execution.  ""The Virgin Suicides"" is the contemplative but always thrilling story of a group of teenage boys who become fixated with five neighbourhood sisters whose lives are swamped by the demands of their neurotic mother (Kathleen Turner). As a final act of paranoid, over-protective parental concern, she takes all five out of school and keeps them locked indoors, all day, every day.  All actors involved, including James Woods as the weak, nervy, nice-guy father, hit their mark every time. So does Sofia Coppola. With a keen eye for the unsettling reality of teen life (for example, youngsters fancying each other with their folks in the room), Coppola has given her tightly-knit tapestry the momentum of a thriller, and her creative approach to many scenes (for instance a conversation shot through a small window) is matched by her use of music in all the right places. For once music, like everything else in the film, is not a lazy afterthought."
715,"The computer giant has sued three men for releasing preview versions of its latest Mac OSX software onto file-sharing sites prior to its release.  It said two versions of the operating system, codenamed Tiger, were put onto the net in October and December.  It is the second time in two weeks Apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. Tiger is due to be shipped in early 2005.  Last week, it filed a lawsuit against ""unnamed individuals"" who leaked details about new products onto the web.  The latest action was against members of the Apple Developer Connection, a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them.  ""Members of Apple Developer Connection receive advance copies of Apple software under strict confidentiality agreements, which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property,"" Apple said in a statement.  It is thought the men used sites which employ BitTorrent technology.  With BitTorrent technology, sites do not host actual files being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have the particular file.  Last week, the Motion Picture Association of America launched a legal campaign targeting websites that operate using the BitTorrent system in an effort to clamp down on movie piracy.  Apple is no stranger to taking legal action against those who leak product information.  In December 2002, it sued a former contractor who allegedly put drawings, images and engineering details of its PowerMac G4 computer online.  The latest action was filed on Monday in the US District Court in California.  It comes just weeks before the MacWorld conference in San Francisco, used to showcase new products."
716,"The latest addition to the portfolio of laws designed to cut the amount of rubbish we bury in the ground has finally come into force in the UK. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires at least 4kg of e-waste (eg PCs, TVs, washing machines) to be recycled per person. Good news for the environment, but past experience shows that the transition from policy to practice is not always seamless. Remember the fridge mountains? The EU directive to cut the emission of ozone-depleting substances was introduced in 2002, when the UK did not have the facilities to safely remove CFCs from fridges. While the infrastructure was hurriedly put into place, the pile of fridges grew higher and higher. WEEE is the fastest growing stream of waste in the European Union. The UK is estimated to produce 1.2 million tonnes of e-waste each year, which until now had mostly ended up in landfill sites. So are we likely to see a new mountain range of PCs and TVs swamp overstretched recycling facilities? Unlikely, says Myles Pilkington, communications manager for the Sims Group, the world's largest materials recovery firm. The directive has been up and running in most European nations for almost two years, where specialised e-waste recycling facilities have been developed. One of Europe's largest plants is located in Eindhoven, the home town of Dutch electronics giant Philips. With a capacity to process 100,000 tons of e-waste a year, the facility is the blueprint of Sims' ""super WEEE plant"", which it is about to build in Newport, South Wales. It is an industrial-scale operation that receives WEEE from all over Europe. Huge tractors shift the materials around hangar-sized sheds, whether it is computer casing, circuit boards, servers or components. ""The advantage of mechanical dismantling over hand dismantling is the classic reason - you are able to handle larger volumes in a safer way,"" Mr Pilkington explained. ""Arguably, you can get better purity of separated materials by hand sorting, but that is far outweighed by the cost saving you get through mechanical processing. ""We are hoping that technological advances mean that we will be able to get exactly the same results soon."" The firm's history of material recovery stretches back a century, making its name and its money in scrap metal. But the hard hats and steel toe-capped boots belie the hi-tech processes behind the massive machinery munching its way through thousands of tonnes of waste. One of the things that really hit us as a result of the WEEE Directive was the need to recover plastics    The group's Recycling Solutions division, which looks after its e-waste business, also has responsibility for the research and development strategy. And e-waste has presented a whole new challenge - plastics. ""One of the things that really hit us as a result of the WEEE Directive was the need to recover plastics,"" recalled Mr Pilkington. ""Plastics recycling is a new and increasingly important part of our operation,"" he explained. ""We had never had to think about it before, and suddenly it has become the significant volume of the materials we process."" When the company audited the flow of materials through the Eindhoven plant's gates, it found many devices, such as household appliances, were made mainly out of plastic. If the company was going to make a success out of processing e-waste, he said, it had to develop ways that could identify and separate the various plastics found in devices. ""The challenge was how we were going to recover these plastics because they were not compatible with each other. Mr Pilkington was a little coy when asked about the solution Sims had developed, fearing that he would give too much away to competitors. He revealed: ""We are actually going to have two very different technologies working alongside each other to achieve the degree of separation we want."" One of the technologies was ""density separation"", which involves passing granulated plastic through different liquids, causing some plastics to float and others to sink. And the other technology? ""It uses sensors to understand the material and an air-gun to blast the plastics in different directions."" While processing plastics is important as far as fulfilling the WEEE Directive is concerned, it is classified as ""low grade"" material. In other words, the resale value of the recovered material is unlikely to cover the processing costs. ""High-grade materials are predominately metal,"" Mr Pilkington explained. ""Whether in the frame or within the electronics, there are potentially a lot of high value precious metals."" Like the plastics, the metal recovery process involves breaking the components down to the size of thumbnails, after any hazardous parts have been removed manually. 8: Cobalt in steel for structure and magnetivity ""Then there are sorting processes to get the [metals] into their individual constituents,"" he added. These include using powerful ""true magnets"" to extract ferrous metals, and eddy currents (a rapidly alternating electrical current) to attract the remaining non-ferrous metals like copper wiring. The Eindhoven plant also has facilities to recover printer cartridges and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) from TVs and monitors. Across Europe, Sims processed 320,000 tonnes of WEEE in 2006. Two-thirds of this, equivalent to 12.7 million PCs, was handled by ""dedicated processes"" like the ones at its plant in Eindhoven. But this is only a small fraction of Europe's estimated annual e-waste of 6.4 million tonnes, admits Mr Pilkington. ""The entire electronic recycling sector within Europe is estimated to be eventually worth six billion euros (£4.1bn), so there is still a long way to go.""     "
717,"China is on course to becoming a superpower - but not in the way many expect, writes economist Martin Jacques.  Beijing these days is positively throbbing with debate. It may not have the trappings of a western-style democracy, but it is now home to the most important and interesting discussions in the world.  When I addressed an audience of young Chinese diplomats at their foreign ministry a year ago, it was abundantly clear that a fascinating debate is under way about what kind of foreign policy might be appropriate for the global power China is in the process of becoming.  What will China be like as a superpower? You might think it is already - it is not.  Its military power is puny compared with that of the US. While America has 11 aircraft carriers, China only commissioned its first last month - based on, of all things, a Ukrainian hull.  And its global political influence is still extremely limited.  The only sense in which China is a superpower is economic - that is, its economy is already over half the size of the US economy and projected to overtake it around 2018, notwithstanding its reduced growth rate of 7%. But this is overwhelmingly a function of China's huge population. In terms of technology and living standards it lags far behind the US.  So when we speak of China as a superpower, we are talking about the future.  A common reaction to the idea of China as a superpower is that it will be like the US - except worse. Worse because it is not a democracy, it has a communist government and because its people are not like us. I guess that gives some the jitters.  In fact we should not expect China to behave in the manner of the US. It will be very different. And nor should we assume that it will necessarily be worse.  Why will it be different? Because its history is so different. Articles about China's growing involvement with Africa - in terms of trade and investment - often talk of the ""new colonialism"".  Beware historical ignorance. China has never colonised any overseas territories. Overseas empires were a European speciality, with Japan getting in on the act for a short while too.  China could have colonised South East Asia, for example, in the early 15th century. It had the resources, it had enormous ships, many times bigger than anything Europe possessed at the time. But it didn't.  That is not to say China ignored its neighbours. On the contrary. For many, many centuries it dominated them - as a result of its sheer size and far more advanced level of development. China's relationship with them was based not on colonialism but what we now know as the tributary system. It neither ruled them nor occupied them. Rather, in return for access to the Chinese market and various forms of protection, the rulers of tribute states were required to give gifts - literally tribute - to the Emperor as a symbolic acknowledgement of China's superiority.  The tributary system comprised what we know today as East Asia, home to one-third of the world's population. It stretched from Japan and Korea to the Malay Peninsula and parts of Indonesia.  It proved remarkably stable, lasting for at least 2,000 years and only coming to an end around 1900.  The West and China share an important characteristic - they both believe they are universal, a model for all others. But the way they have interpreted this in practice has been entirely different. For Europe, and latterly the US, it meant projecting their power around the world, most spectacularly during the heyday of colonialism in the 19th and first half of the 20th Century, when a large part of the world found itself under European rule.  We governed from afar, exported our ways of doing things, imposed our languages, our education, our religion and much else besides.  The Chinese, in contrast, preferred to stay at home. They believed the Middle Kingdom, the old name for China, literally meaning the centre of the world, was the highest form of civilisation. So why step outside into ever darkening shades of barbarianism?  The seven great voyages of Zheng He between 1405 and 1433 around the East and South China Seas and across the Indian Ocean as far as East Africa left no permanent mark - they were about demonstrating the glory of the Middle Kingdom rather than a desire to conquer. Those who left China to settle in South East Asia were seen as leaving civilisation and deserving of no support or protection by the Emperor.  Compare that with the way in which Britain and France celebrated the heroes of their colonial expansion. Our cities are littered with statues and street names in their memory.  There is another reason why the Chinese have tended to stay at home. The country is huge, diverse - and extremely difficult to govern. The overwhelming preoccupation of its rulers down the ages has been how to maintain order and stability and thereby retain power. It remains just as true today.  Rather than look outwards, China's leaders look inwards. The exception was China's own continental land mass. Its expansion, rather than to the four corners of the world, was confined to its own continent.  The most dramatic example was the westward march of the Qing dynasty from the mid-17th Century which, in a series of bloody and brutal wars, doubled the physical size of China.  So what, you might ask, does all this history tell us about how China might behave as a great global power? A great deal.  Europe, I would argue, has historically been an extremely aggressive and expansionist continent. Its own history has been characterised by seemingly endless wars which were then transplanted onto a global stage during the era of colonial expansion and world war. Military might, the projection of power around the world, and the desire if necessary by force to impose our way of life on others, have been fundamental to the European story.  And it is not difficult to see how the US - itself the product of European overseas expansion and settlement - inherited these characteristics from us.  China won't be like this. It is not in its DNA. Its rulers will be far less interested in seeking to dominate the rest of the world and far more concerned with keeping themselves in power. That is what ruling a country containing a fifth of the world's population obliges. When Xi Jinping becomes Chinese leader next month, his in-tray, as with Hu Jintao before him, will be overwhelmingly filled with domestic rather than foreign issues.  In time China will certainly come to enjoy huge global power. It will be exercised, however, in a rather different way.  The iconic form of western power has been military. Extraordinarily, the US today accounts for around half of global defence expenditure. Before, European colonial expansion was only possible because its fighting capacity was massively superior to that of the rest of the world.  That kind of overweening military power has never really been a Chinese characteristic.  Instead the quintessential forms of Chinese power will be economic and cultural. Over time, China's economic strength - given the size of its population - will be gigantic, far greater than that of the US at its zenith. Already, even at its present low level of development, China is the main trading partner of a multitude of countries around the world. And with economic power will come commensurate political power and influence. China will, if it wishes, be able to bend many other countries to its will.  Cultural power will also be important to the Chinese. Theirs is a remarkable civilisation - having enjoyed a place in the sun not once but several times. During the Tang dynasty, for instance, from the 7th to the 10th Century, and most remarkably during the Song dynasty from the 10th to the 13th Century, with major advances in a host of fields from biology and hydraulic engineering to architecture, medicine, mathematics and cartography.  The Chinese are enormously proud of their historical achievements. They believe that theirs is the greatest civilisation there has ever been.  They have a strong sense of their own superiority rooted in history. They have long had a hierarchical view of the world, with China at the top. And the rise of China is likely to accentuate these views.  But don't expect the Chinese to be impatient about their rise. In 1972 Henry Kissinger is reputed to have asked Zhou En Lai, the former Chinese premier, what he thought of the French Revolution. Zhou En Lai's response: ""It's too early to know"".  The Chinese have a completely different conception of time to Westerners. Whereas Americans think very short, the Chinese think very long.  For them a century is nothing."

Jung was born in the years after Mao came to power in China and as a child she took part in the Great Leap Forwards by collecting saucepans and nails and trying to melt them down for steel. She was a teenager during the Cultural Revolution and witnessed her parents being denounced and sent to labour camps.  After Mao's death she came to Britain as a student. At the time, she says, she didn't want to think about the past - it used to give her nightmares and so she would pretend she was from Korea. But 10 years after her arrival in Britain, her mother came to visit. She told Jung the stories of her and her grandmother's lives and Jung decided their intimate, family history deserved to have a wider audience. Her book, Wild Swans, has sold more than 12 million copies and won a host of awards.  Investigating her own life and those of her mother and grandmother not only brought the suffering of a nation into sharp focus it was also a liberating experience - once the book was finished, she says, the nightmares stopped.

719,"Head of the Muslim Council of Britain Sir Iqbal Sacranie said introducing the partnerships did ""not augur well"" for building the foundations of society.  Nevertheless, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme, everyone should be tolerant.  Peter Tatchell of gay rights group OutRage! said: ""It is tragic for one minority to attack another minority.""  Sir Iqbal said of civil partnerships: ""This is harmful.  ""It does not augur well in building the very foundations of society - stability, family relationships. And it is something we would certainly not, in any form, encourage the community to be involved in.""  He said he was guided by the teachings of the Muslim faith, adding that other religions such as Christianity and Judaism held the same stance.  Asked if he believed homosexuality was harmful to society, he said: ""Certainly it is a practice that in terms of health, in terms of the moral issues that comes along in a society - it is. It is not acceptable.""  ""Each of our faiths tells us that it is harmful and I think, if you look into the scientific evidence that has been available in terms of the forms of various other illnesses and diseases that are there, surely it points out that where homosexuality is practised there is a greater concern in that area.""  He said everyone in society should be tolerant, and if they are not happy then engage in the democratic processes to give their views.  ""We may not be happy with the views being expressed by others. But the difficulty comes in that at the end of the day we are human beings.""  He said both the opponents and supporters of civil partnerships had the right to speak out.  Mr Tatchell, the founder of OutRage!, added: ""Both the Muslim and gay communities suffer prejudice and discrimination. We should stand together to fight Islamophobia and homophobia."""
720,"Heathrow Airport has unveiled three options for a new runway, saying each one would be ""quicker and cheaper"" than plans for a rival hub airport.  The airport's submission to the Davies Commission, which is looking at raising airport capacity, outlined a runway to the north, north-west or south-west of the existing airport.  It said a new runway could be in place by 2029, allowing 260,000 more flights.  Heathrow submitted its options to the government-appointed Airports Commission, headed by former Financial Services Authority chairman Sir Howard Davies.  It is reviewing how the UK might expand its airport capacity in south-east England and interested parties have until Friday 19 July to submit their preferred options.  Ahead of submitting its proposals on Friday, Gatwick bosses said this week that they would prefer ""a constellation system of three London airports - keeping Heathrow open, whilst building an additional runway at Gatwick, and then perhaps in time a new runway at Stansted"".  On Monday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson published proposals for three possible replacement hubs - an artificial island in the Thames Estuary dubbed ""Boris Island"", a major expansion at Stansted, or an airport at the Isle of Grain in north Kent.  The commission is expected to recommend options by the end of this year, but will not submit its final report until summer 2015 - after the next general election.  According to Heathrow's submission, building a new runway would deliver extra capacity at the airport by 2025-29 and would allow it to operate 740,000 flights a year - up from the current limit of 480,000.  Heathrow's preferred option would be to place a new runway to the north-west or the south-west of the airport.  This would ""deliver a full-length third runway while minimising the impact on the local community"".  The submission also detailed how a new westerly runway would help reduce noise pollution because planes would not have to fly so low over London.  It predicted that, even with a third runway, there would be 10-20% fewer people affected by noise under its new plans.  Each of the options would mean the compulsory purchase of some properties and some property demolitions, as well as potentially major work on the M25.  Stanwell Moor is a village near Heathrow and one of its councillors said it would ""get completely destroyed"" under one of the options.  I've just been looking back through my notes from last year, when I talked to government officials about the prospect of building a third runway at Heathrow. They told me it was ""dead and buried"" and said they'd look at ""all ideas bar a third runway"". Back then we also had a Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, who lived under the flight path and had campaigned against the plan. What a difference to today, when a third runway at the UK's biggest and busiest airport is very much back on the table. This is a big week for airports. By Friday, we'll know all the different suggestions on how they could expand. But don't let all this apparent momentum fool you. This is one of the thorniest issues in politics, and there are plenty in the industry who think that 20 years from now, nothing will have actually been done.  ""I wasn't totally surprised because we knew these would be in the pipeline but it's a pretty desperate situation and pretty frightening,"" said Robert Evans.  ""The real problem now is the area is blighted and there will be a period of uncertainty; people will be anxious because they bought their homes and now they find the home isn't the asset they thought.""  Residents' group Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise (Hacan) said it would fight any proposal for a new runway ""tooth and nail"".  Hacan chairman John Stewart said it was difficult to square Heathrow's claim that expansion could take place while cutting noise for residents.  Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews said the UK ""desperately needed a single hub airport with the capacity to provide the links to emerging economies which can boost UK jobs, GDP and trade"".  ""It is clear the best solution for taxpayers, passengers and business is to build on the strength we already have at Heathrow,"" he said.  Mr Matthews said he had not ruled out a fourth runway at Heathrow, but said this would not be needed until at least 2040.  However, Mr Johnson said the proposals for a new runway at Heathrow ""were politically, environmentally and socially unacceptable"".  ""There will be more pigs flying than aircraft if we are to believe the claim that three runways at Heathrow will make less noise than two,"" he said.  Mr Johnson added the move ""would be a disastrous outcome for Londoners, nor would it solve our aviation capacity crisis as a fourth runway would need to be in the planning process before a third was even open"".  Greenpeace accused the airport of presenting a ""reheated and rehashed"" plan with the same ""flawed arguments that failed so categorically last time around"".  But business groups backed the plans, including the trade body which represents Britain's airlines.  The Board of Airline Representatives said no other proposal so far on airport capacity could ""deliver the UK's hub airport capacity quicker, at the right cost, or in the right place for airlines and their passengers""."

A gypsy (Django) four negroes and a Jew alongside a German officer outside La Cigale in occupied Paris.

Yet when war broke out in 1939 Django, touring in London with Stephane Grappelli, immediately returned home to Paris. He not only survived the war, he thrived and became a star. And it wasn't just the French that came to La Cigale to hear him, the Nazis came too.      Miles Kington explores the curiosity of jazz thriving under Goebbels and of Django's unusual life with contributions from Bert Weedon, Coleridge Goode, Mike Zwerin and Stephane Grappelli plus music by Jean Sablon, Guerino, Coleridge Goode and Django himself.       Listen again to the programme      Mike Zwerin's book Swing Under the Nazis: Jazz as a Metaphor for Freedom is published by Cooper Square Press, ISBN: 0815410751 Mike Zwerin on jazz in the third Reich   Photo Archive of Django Reinhardt   BBC biography of Django   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites   "
722,"Charles Bronson's glasses were smashed during an incident involving two members of staff at Full Sutton high security prison in East Yorkshire.  Bronson, 54, from Luton, was first jailed for armed robbery in 1974.  Since then he has held fellow prisoners and staff hostage on three occasions and carried out several assaults.  It is unclear what happened in the incident which led to Bronson's glasses being broken, but a HM Prison Service statement described it as a ""control and restraint incident"".  The statement said: ""A prisoner has been offered compensation of under £200 after a control and restraint incident.""  Bronson - who changed his name by deed poll from Michael Peterson in the 1980s - staged a 47-hour rooftop protest at Broadmoor in 1983, causing £750,000 of damage.  In 1994, while he was holding a guard hostage at Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes, he demanded an inflatable doll, a helicopter and a cup of tea as ransom.  Two months later, he held deputy governor Adrian Wallace hostage for five hours at Hull Prison, injuring him so badly he was off work for five weeks.  In total, Bronson has been held at all three of Britain's security hospitals and at least 28 conventional prisons.  However, in 1995 Bronson won the literary Koestler award for his writing about prison life called Living Legends."
723,"It is widely accepted that under international law, the Jewish settlements in the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 are illegal. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war states: ""The occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own population into the territories it occupies."" Within the international community the overwhelming view is that Article 49 is applicable to the occupation of the West Bank including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. Almost the entire international community, including allies of Israel, have referred to the situation in these territories as occupation. The position that the 4th Geneva Convention does apply to the West Bank, Gaza and Golan Heights is supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, UN bodies, and the International Court of Justice. Israel is a party to the Geneva Conventions, and bound by its obligations. But its government argues that the international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to the Palestinian territories because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state in the first place. Israel has over the years often chosen to use the term administered territories to refer to Gaza and the West Bank. It has annexed the Golan and East Jerusalem. Israel therefore denies the formal, de jure, applicability of the 4th Geneva Convention in the occupied territories. Israel does formally accept the applicability of the Hague Regulations on occupation, and says it is acting under authority granted to an occupying power in international law (including in provisions of the 4th Geneva Convention). The 4th Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulations contain detailed rules on the administration of occupied territory. The Israeli Supreme Court (sitting as High Court of Justice in Beit Sourik Village Council v The Government of Israel 2004) has noted: ""The general point of departure of all parties - which is also our point of departure - is that Israel holds the area in belligerent occupation (occupatio bellica).""

724,"Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has appeared on TV for the first time since being badly burned in an attack on his palace last month.  He did not move his arms, and both his hands were bandaged.  Mr Saleh has been undergoing treatment in Saudi Arabia since 6 June following the attack, which officials said was caused by a bomb.  Yemen has been rocked by months of unrest, with protesters calling for Mr Saleh's resignation.  He has refused to step down and has resisted several attempts at mediated solutions.  In Thursday's address aired on Yemen's state TV, the president said that dialogue was needed to resolve Yemen's problems.  He said he welcomed power-sharing, but stressed that it should be ""within the framework of the constitution and in the framework of the law"".  Referring to his injuries sustained during the attack on his compound in Sanaa in June, Mr Saleh admitted that he had undergone ""more than eight successful operations"".  ""I had burns because of the accident. There were also a number of operations for a number of officials such as the speaker of parliament, the prime minister, his deputy, and the governor of Sanaa. More than 87 people were injured.""  Mr Saleh is still recovering in Saudi Arabia, amid speculation in Yemen that he might soon return to the country.  Seven people were killed in the incident, while Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Mujawar and at least two other senior officials were also seriously injured.  Western diplomats have been helping the Yemeni authorities to investigate the attack and have confirmed that a large quantity of the high explosive TNT had been placed inside the mosque where President Saleh attended Friday prayers.  Mr Saleh has ruled Yemen since 1978. His departure followed weeks of unrest which has left more than 350 people dead.  Fighting has been particularly fierce in the southern province of Abyan, where militants have exploited the political vacuum to move into the towns of Zinjibar and Jaar.  Opposition groups accuse the Sanaa government of playing up the jihadist threat in an attempt to shore up Western support.  Mr Saleh has refused to sign a Gulf-mediated transition plan that would see him step down from power in return for immunity from prosecution over the deaths of protesters in the five-month uprising."
725,"Tens of thousands of Britain's miners have stopped work in what looks like becoming a long battle against job losses.  More than half the country's 187,000 mineworkers are now on strike. Miners in Yorkshire and Kent were the first to down tools this morning - by tonight they had been joined by colleagues in Scotland and South Wales.  The trouble began over an announcement by Chairman of the Coal Board Ian MacGregor six days ago that 20 uneconomic pits would have to close, putting 20,000 miners out of work.  Miners at Cortonwood colliery in Yorkshire - the first earmarked for closure - walked out at midnight on 5 March in protest at the plans.  National Union of Mineworkers president Arthur Scargill is calling on members across the country to join the action. He is relying on flying pickets to drum up support.  Today, violence flared on the picket line at Bilston Glen colliery in Scotland, when miners from the recently closed Polmaise pit tried to stop others going into work.  Punches were thrown and one picket was hurt when a vehicle ran over his foot.  At Harworth in Nottinghamshire, where miners are known to be more moderate, miners' wives turned out to support their husbands crossing the picket lines.  In South Wales, initial soundings suggested miners were overwhelmingly opposed to a strike - and a number of pits were still working today.  But local NUM spokesman Terry Thomas predicted support for the stoppage would grow.  ""Over the next 24 hours there is going to be a realisation by the members still at work that if 85% of the coalfield see fit to stand up and try to save their industry, I honestly believe they will be joined by the people now at work,"" he said.  Mr MacGregor says he is ready to fight. ""Our customers are prepared for a very lengthy strike. Judging by what our customers have done, they have put together large stocks because of their concern about the fairly wild statements that have been made,"" he said.  About four months' supply of coal, or 22m tons, at the pitheads and more than 26m at the power stations, have been stockpiled in readiness for a prolonged stoppage.  Mick McGahey, vice-president of the NUM, told a news conference the miners were not just fighting for their own jobs - but other industries too.  He said: ""I want to emphasise the knock-on effects of the closure in pits and the loss of miners' jobs, the effect that will have on railways, the steel industry, engineering and electrical industries, because we don't only produce coal."""
726,"Most of the casualties were Japanese, Swiss and German tourists. Three Britons were among the dead.  Gunmen fired on them as they visited the temple of Hatshepsut in the town of Luxor. Dozens were gunned down.  A two-hour gunbattle followed, as the assailants, believed to be Islamic extremists, tried to escape into nearby ravines.  Police said there was six of gunmen and that they were all killed.  According to preliminary figures released by the Egyptian Interior Ministry, 57 tourists, a local guide and two policemen died in the attack.  Other reports say the death toll at the temple of Hatshepsut, near Luxor, could rise as high as 75, with up to 85 others injured.  The Islamic extremist group, Jamaa Islamiyya, is reported to have admitted responsbility for the attack.  Islamic militants have often targeted tourists since they took up arms in 1992 to topple the government and set up a purist Islamic state.  Luxor, about 310 miles (500 km ) south of Cairo, had previously been spared attacks by militants who have strongholds in other parts of southern Egypt.     ""We were told it was a feudal battle,"" one shaken British tourist, Ellen Gibson said.  The US embassy warned American citizens not to travel to southern Egypt ""until the security situation is clarified and further notice is provided"".  The Japanese Embassy in Cairo is advising its nationals against travelling to Egypt until the full facts of the massacre are known.  Security sources several seriously wounded victims were being flown to military hospitals in Cairo.  A curfew was imposed on Luxor, visited by about two million tourists a year, security officials added.  Last month Egypt threw a heavy security cordon around Hatshepsut temple for a performance of Verdi's opera Aida attended by showbusiness personalities and the wives of foreign leaders.  The 4,500-year-old temple, partly carved into a limestone cliff, is one of ancient Egypt's finest monuments.  On September 18, two brothers fired by Islamic fervour shot and petrol-bombed a tour bus in central Cairo, killing nine German tourists and an Egyptian driver on September 18. The confessed killers were caught, tried and sentenced to death.     Attacks by militants have killed 34 foreign tourists in the past five years. Their struggle with the government has cost more than 1,100 lives, mostly militants and police.  A Swiss medical team is to fly to Egypt to help care for Swiss victims of the attack.  The massacre happened as 65 suspected Muslim militants went on trial accused of conspiring to murder and joining an outlawed group.  The Luxor attack has brought condemnation and messages of condolence from European leaders.  The British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said he was horrified by what he called a sickening act of violence.  His German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, described it as repugnant and cowardly.  Some European tour companies are making arrangements to fly home clients wishing to leave Egypt."
727,"Carlos Tevez's hat-trick helped Manchester City beat Norwich to reduce Manchester United's lead to two points at the Premier League summit.  Tevez's swerving effort beat John Ruddy before he set up Sergio Aguero.  Norwich replied when Andrew Surman blasted in after Joe Hart's punch.  But Tevez boosted the lead with a header and Aguero's solo effort added the gloss before Tevez rounded Ruddy to complete his hat-trick and Adam Johnson slotted in from close range.  The Argentine celebrated his third strike with a golf swing, perhaps mocking those who questioned his desire during his unauthorised leave of absence in his home country where he was pictured on the golf course.  But after a fractious period in his Manchester City career, his performance and the result showed that his team's title challenge was back on track.  For all boss Roberto Mancini's claims that his team have no chance of overtaking rivals United, who host Aston Villa on Sunday, the Italian's players showed they have not given up.  Aguero, who was also a menace and scored two fine goals, came inches away from matching his countryman's tally when he hit the post late on.  It was a deadly exhibition of finishing from the front two, and City look to have recovered their former fluency, but the scoreline was harsh on Norwich, who pressured the visitors early on, and tested them again after reducing the deficit to 2-1.  Four goals in the last 17 minutes swept their challenge aside to give Manchester City their first away league win since 12 February but before the visitors could take control, they had to withstand an early barrage from the in-form Canaries.  Paul Lambert's side almost led when Joleon Lescott cleared Grant Holt's header off the line following a corner, the visiting defenders protesting as Anthony Pilkington appeared to block Hart.  The Manchester City players had already made their feelings known to referee Chris Foy when Tevez was booked for diving, after he appeared to be caught by Ryan Bennett.  But soon after, Tevez's recent rehabilitation continued when he was fed down the right by a re-energised David Silva and struck a swerving shot that beat Ruddy at his near post.  The second goal was a gem as Aguero supplied Tevez in the inside left channel and then picked up his fellow countryman's backheel to fire past Ruddy.  That strike knocked the wind out of Norwich, with Grant Holt's effort on the half-turn the only significant return before the break.  In 2005, Norwich director Delia Smith issued her infamous ""Let's be 'aving you"" rallying cry during the interval in a Premiership game between these two teams. But the Canaries - who had won seven of their previous eight home league games - are a different proposition under Lambert, and the Scot settled for a double substitution to rouse his side.  The move quickly brought reward when one of the replacements, Surman, steered the ball in after Hart had punched Adam Drury's cross clear.  And the other replacement, Wes Hoolahan, helped improve Norwich's midfield as they supported the advanced Aaron Wilbraham.  But as Norwich pressed, the visitors almost caught them on the break twice and Yaya Toure's arrival from the bench proved pivotal as three goals then flew in during the space of seven minutes.  It fell to another substitute Johnson to complete the rout after a sweeping move, and with City to face bottom-of-the-table Wolves before they play Manchester United at Etihad Stadium on 30 April, their confidence could by then be sky high.  Norwich boss Paul Lambert: ""I think for 70-odd minutes we were well in the game. At 2-1 we looked really good and in the second half we played really well but if you're losing four goals in that space of time it was poor from our point of view. The effort was there in abundance, as it always is, but maybe the scoreline was severe.  ""You can't legislate for losing three goals in seven minutes, and we'll learn from it. You take your medicine and you bounce back. Their strike force is incredible, the first two goals were world class. [Our] team have done brilliant, I can't be too harsh on them.""

728,"Sarah Teather is to step down as an MP at the next election, citing ""some aspects of government policy"".  The Lib Dem was first elected in 2003 in Brent East, north-west London, at the age of 29 - making her the youngest MP in Britain - and later elected to the new seat of Brent Central.  She served as children's minister in the coalition government before returning to the backbenches last year.  A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was ""disappointed"" by her decision.  It comes a week before the annual party conference.  Ms Teather told the Observer she was stepping down because ""she no longer feels that Nick Clegg's party fights sufficiently for social justice and liberal values on immigration"".  It quoted her as saying that Mr Clegg's tougher approach to immigration - including a plan for some immigrants to pay a £1,000 deposit when applying for visas - left her feeling ""desolate"" and ""catastrophically depressed"".  ""It was an absolutely black moment. I couldn't even move from my seat when I read it. I was so depressed I couldn't even be angry. I was utterly desolate,"" she is quoted as saying.  She also pointed to her party's decision to back the Tories' planned cap on welfare, while she was in government.  ""It was the moment of realising that my own party was just as afraid of public opinion as the Labour Party. Something did break for me that was never, ever repaired,"" she said.  In the statement on her website, she said: ""For various reasons, to do with some aspects of government policy and the very particular issues that brought me to politics in the first place, I now feel that come the next general election, it will be the right time for me to step aside.""  She went on: ""As with most party members, there have always been a few issues where I have disagreed with party policy.  ""But over the last three years, what has been difficult is that policy has moved in some of the issues that ground my own personal sense of political vocation - that of working with and serving the most vulnerable members of society.  ""I have disagreed with both government and official party lines on a whole range of welfare and immigration policies, and those differences have been getting larger rather than smaller.""  She said she had tried to balance fighting for what she believed in with the ""loyalty and friendship"" she felt towards colleagues - but that had created ""intense pressure, and at times left me very tired"".  ""I don't think it is sustainable for me personally to continue to try and do that in the long term,"" she said.  Most recently Ms Teather voted against the government's motion on potential military action in Syria in response to the suspected use of chemical weapons.  The MP, who is chair of the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, also criticised the government's immigration poster campaign which told illegal immigrants to ""go home or face arrest"".  In 2003 she overturned a Labour majority of more than 13,000 to be elected in Brent East and increased her majority at the 2005 general election.  Following boundary changes she won the Brent Central seat in 2010, by a slim margin of 1,345.  Ms Teather was appointed minister for children and families in the coalition government, but she lost her place in September last year to make room for the return of David Laws, who resigned over his expenses in 2010.  A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ""Of course we are disappointed by Sarah's decision.  ""The Liberal Democrats have a proud record in government, including cutting taxes for working people by £700 and lifting the poorest paid out of tax altogether, helping businesses create a million jobs; investing billions more in schools to help the poorest children and introducing radical plans for shared parental leave.  ""Sarah was a part of this when she served as a minister in the coalition, as well as playing a key role in ending Labour's disgraceful policy of locking up children for immigration purposes."""
729,"In an annual keynote speech, he said the move was needed ""in order that the imperial throne be continued into the future in a stable manner"".  Under existing rules only men are allowed to become emperors, but no boys have been born into the imperial family for 40 years.  Mr Koizumi also vowed to improve relations with China and South Korea.  ""While there may be differences in opinion or disputes in certain areas, China and South Korea are very important neighbours,"" he said.  Speaking at what could be his last annual address at the opening of the Japanese parliament, Mr Koizumi said the government would submit a bill to reform the Imperial Household Law.  He did not provide details of the proposal, or when it would be submitted. But he said it would be in line with the conclusions of a government panel which last year recommended letting women inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne.  If the change goes ahead, it would pave the way for Emperor Akihito's four-year-old grand-daughter, Aiko, to become second in line to the throne after her father, Crown Prince Naruhito, the present heir.  Crown Prince Naruhito and his wife Masako have not yet had a son. Masako, 42, has partially withdrawn from public life due to a stress-related illness, said to be partly induced by the pressure on her to produce an heir.  Opinion polls in Japan suggest a majority of people think that women should be allowed on the throne.  But some conservatives - including Prince Tomohito, a cousin of Emperor Akihito - have opposed the idea, suggesting instead the crown prince use concubines to produce a male heir.  In Friday's speech, Mr Koizumi also said he wanted to debate holding a national referendum on revisions to Japan's pacifist constitution.  He also touched on other issues, including his country's frayed relations with South Korea and China.  Beijing and Tokyo have been engaged in a number of disputes over the past year, both over oil resources and Japan's attitude to its colonial and wartime history - an issue which also annoys Seoul.  Mr Koizumi said that while there may be differences between the neighbours, ""we will strengthen co-operation from a comprehensive standpoint to construct future-oriented relations based on trust"".  Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso, a possible contender to succeed Mr Koizumi as prime minister, echoed these sentiments.  ""Developing Sino-Japanese relations is one of our country's basic foreign policies,"" Mr Aso is quoted as saying.  Mr Koizumi has said he will step down as prime minister in September at the end of his four-year term as head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party."
730,"In its race to provide future growth, the speed at which China is adopting new technologies is breathtaking.  Take one example: high speed rail.  Five years ago, there was not a single kilometre of high speed track in China. Today, it has more than Europe and by 2012, it will have more than the rest of the world put together.  A vast, spotless factory in the port city of Qingdao is in the front line of this new industrial revolution.  It is here that the giant state-controlled train-making company CSR developed a Chinese high-speed train.  China's leaders ""played a strong role in making all of this happen"", says CSR's chairman, Xiaogang Zhao.  China's leaders started by demanding that any foreign company bidding for a part of the massive proposed high-speed programme to share its technology with a Chinese partner.  The Japanese engineering giant Kawasaki accepted this condition. A pioneer of high-speed rail, with almost half a century of development to its name, Kawasaki agreed to share its knowledge with CSR.  Siemens of Germany struck a similar deal with another Chinese train-maker.  With access to foreign know-how secured, the government then provided an army of 10,000 engineers and academics to create a Chinese train, Mr Zhao explains.  They did it, he says, in less than three years.  Inside the Qingdao factory, senior engineer Ding Sansan explains how every aspect of the Japanese train had to be redesigned for the faster 350 kilometres per hour running speed that China's high-speed strategy demanded.  Everyone worked so hard on the project that he can hardly remember his last holiday.  ""It was a very big challenge"", he says.  And it is just the beginning.  Mr Ding is now working on a new train, due to be tested next year at an astonishing 500 kilometres per hour.  Having acquired the technology, China is already exporting it.  This year, CSR supplanted Siemens as lead contractor on a new 440 kilometre high-speed line in Saudi Arabia.  Outside China, the speed at which such leading-edge technologies are being adopted is causing concern.  But China now plans to go one step further.  Under a new proposal, ""indigenous innovation"", foreign companies bidding for Chinese government contracts will not only have to share existing know-how.  They will also be required to conduct any new research and development work in China.  For some companies this will prove an unacceptable condition, according to Brenda Foster, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.  ""It will keep American companies from being able to compete in the Chinese domestic market,"" she says.  ""For some companies, that could actually put them out of business.""  While America and China argue over ""indigenous innovation"", China is taking a new, direct approach - encouraging highly-skilled Chinese-born expatriates to return home from overseas, bringing their ideas and expertise with them.  But some of these experts have found that China's top-down, centrally-controlled culture, so successful in delivering technologies such as high-speed rail, can prove an obstacle to innovation.  Top medical scientist Professor Guosong Liu, moved from America to take up a post at Tsinghua, China's leading scientific university.  There, the memory and intelligence-enhancing drugs he has been developing in the US and Germany are being tested on thousands of rats and mice.  For such meticulous, labour-intensive work, Professor Liu says, China's hierarchical culture is perfect.  But when it comes to innovation, ""this culture inhibits the evolution of new ideas"", he says.  Professor Liu finds his Chinese students to be very different from their American counterparts.  Where American students are active in the lecture hall and constantly challenge what they are told, Chinese respect for hierarchy and authority means that even at a top university such as Tsinghua, it is hard to generate creative debate, he explains.  ""I always say there's no stupid question. Ask me something stupid - it's better than nothing"", Professor Liu says.  ""But they sit there. Maybe they're scared of me, but they're not challenging me"".  Another top scientific returnee, Professor Shi Yigong, shocked his colleagues at the top US university Princeton by turning down a $10m research grant to become Dean of Life Sciences at Tsinghua.  ""Every time you say something, you have to think whether what I said appeases my superior,"" he says.  ""You begin to limit your innovation. I think you basically have less innovative factors in your mind"".  Companies outside China may fear the break-neck speed at which China is adopting leading edge technologies.  But when it comes to new ideas and innovation, Professor Shi says, China's top-down, hierarchical culture means Europe and the US look likely to keep their competitive edge for some time yet.

731,"One of the world's oldest commercial computers has been brought back to life by two enthusiasts in a barn in Kent.  The ICT1301 computer, known as Flossie, was restored to working order on its 50th anniversary by engineers Roger Holmes and Rod Brown in Bethersden.  The 20ft (6m) by 22ft machine was built to replace rows of clerks doing office work and featured in the 1974 James Bond film The Man With The Golden Gun.  Bought for £200 in 2003, it has 100th of the power of a smartphone.  Mr Holmes, a Computer Conservation Society volunteer, said it was a unique machine important for putting modern technology into context.  He said he was negotiating with various organisations to find it a new home.  ""It's a big beast. I would like it go somewhere they will continue to keep it running,"" he said.  ""If it is kept behind a case, people will not be able to experience what it was like in the 1960s.  ""With it working, people can walk in, hear it, smell it and almost taste it and have a flavour of how it was back then.""  Flossie originally cost £250,000 to build in 1962, the equivalent of £4.2m today.  It has 100,000 punch cards and 27 reels of magnetic tape, both to record data, and its 12 kilobytes of memory alone weigh half a tonne.  Each piece of memory has five lengths of wire threaded by hand.  Mr Brown said: ""You have to remember that file reels in those days were multi-reel, so at 10 meg a reel, 27 reels, we're up to a quarter of a gigabyte - and 50 years ago that was a lot of data.""  Mr Holmes said Flossie took the drudgery out of office work in the 1960s, but also cost jobs.  ""Before this, there were huge great rooms 100ft square full of clerks doing nothing but calculation, and recording things, and taking the files out, and changing them, and putting them back again - and they all became redundant,"" he said.  Flossie was used as a prop in Bond film The Man With The Golden Gun starring Roger Moore and also in two BBC TV series - Doctor Who and Blake's 7."
732,"Worcestershire crashed out of the Friends Provident Trophy after being bowled out for the lowest one-day score in their history by Ireland. Needing a win to finish top of Group A, the home side looked on course when they bowled out the Irish for 152. But they were then sensationally bowled out for just 58 to lose by 94 runs. Kiwi Peter Connell took 5-19 as Steve Rhodes' side slumped from 20-1 to 21-6 - and Worcester never recovered, Daryl Mitchell being left stranded on 15. Worcestershire began the day second in Group A and looking for a win to ensure a home quarter-final on Saturday. But they ended up finishing third in the group and missing out on the quarter-finals completely, thanks to Hampshire's equally stunning 10-wicket win over Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. This was Ireland's day, though, and the country's cricketers (made up of five Irishmen, three Aussies, two New Zealanders and a Londoner) received a standing ovation at New Road. It was their first win in 12 games in this competition since beating Warwickshire in Belfast in 2008. Worcestershire's previous lowest one-day score was 70 against Gloucestershire in a Benson and Hedges Cup qualifier, also at New Road in April 2002. Ireland, who lost by 52 runs when they Worcestershire in Belfast last month, had never previously bowled out a county for less than a hundred. But they stunned the New Road crowd by bowling out the home side in 20.3 overs. The Irish had themselves been on trouble on 75-6, only to be rescued by a stand of 57 for the seventh wicket between Kyle McCallan (40) and Trent Johnston (39). But woeful Worcestershire soon hit massive problems, as Connell grabbed his five wickets for a mere three runs in the space of just 14 balls. He began in sensational style by ripping out home skipper Vikram Solanki. Then, from 20-1, the home side truly buckled as Connell also removed Worcester's other opener Stephen Moore and Moeen Ali, bowled first ball. Kevin O'Brien heaped on the pressure by trapping Alex Kervezee leg before. But Connell regained the spotlight by also removing Steven Davies and Gareth Batty to leave home hopes in tatters on 21-6. Mitchell tried to repair the damage in a 29-run stand in 10 overs with Ashley Noffke, but he holed out to square leg off fellow Aussie Johnston. And both Johnston and another of their Australians Alex Cusack claimed two wickets apiece as unfancied Ireland finished things off - to register embarrassed Worcestershire's lowest total in 46 years of one-day cricket.

733,A long battle to open the first ever secondary free school in Swanage ended earlier as pupils arrived for classes.

The battle to start the school began when parents discovered changes to county council schools would mean pupils over the age of 11 would have to be educated about 10 miles away in Wareham.
734,"An 18th Century breakwater on the River Severn in Gloucestershire has been rediscovered.  The stone structure, known as Hock Crib, near Frampton-on-Severn, was built to protect farmland from erosion.  Until recently it was buried beneath sandbanks and is now only visible at extremely low tide.  Two local historians have been given a grant to photograph and record its remains using a camera mounted in a remote controlled helicopter.  Rose Hewlett and Arthur Price have been given a £430 grant by the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society (BGAS) to study the site at Fretherne.  Ms Hewlett said the structure, which was also referred to as the Great Bulwark, was built in 1739 by the fourth Earl of Berkeley.  ""Hock Crib comes up in the records for Frampton, and is also mentioned in the Berkeley Castle records,"" she said. ""It's always fascinated me.""  Ms Hewlett said a crib is a local term, used along the Severn Estuary, for a breakwater.  ""We knew that it had gradually decayed. We could see it mentioned on old maps and in the records in different archives,"" she added.  ""To the untrained eye it looks like a pile of stones. When you get very low tides you can see the foundations of the curved wall.""  Ms Hewlett said conditions in the river were now right for the structure to be identified because the main deep river channel has recently shifted towards the eastern bank, keeping the sand from covering the foundations.  ""It's an interesting piece of archaeology on the Severn Estuary. Sea defences have been built here since Roman times, it was important to defend the land,"" she said.  ""We've now been given the opportunity to safely explore the archaeology. It's not the sort of place where you want to be stood out there doing a lot of measurements with the tide bearing down on you.""  It is hoped the archaeological survey will be carried out some time next year."
735,"A £250,000 fine imposed on Thames Water after raw sewage was pumped into a rural brook was ""lenient"", a court of appeal judge has ruled.  Chase Brook, near Newbury, Berkshire was polluted by a sewage leak which continued for a week in September 2012.  A judge at the Court of Appeal ruled the fine imposed in August 2014, which included a further £7,000 in costs, could easily have been higher.  Thames Water said it ""very much regretted"" the damage caused.  It did not comment specifically on the dismissal of its appeal, but said a thorough clean-up of the watercourse had since been carried out and it had also paid for a National Trust warden.  Chase Brook flows through a National Trust nature reserve, part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  The leak was caused by two clogged-up pumps at the Broad Layings Sewage Pumping Station.  Alarms went off more than a dozen times, warning of rising sewage levels, but Thames Water staff did not respond, Mr Justice Mitting said.  The court heard just five months before sewage overflowed into the brook, one or both of the pumps had failed at least 16 times.  Only after the leak was spotted by a member of the public were the pumps finally unblocked.  They were replaced with newer, more robust, pumps, capable of coping with '""rags"" thrown into the sewage system.  Thames Water admitted breaches of environmental protection regulations when the fine was imposed.  At the appeal, its lawyers claimed it had been treated far too harshly.  However, Mr Justice Mitting said the ""very large"" company's prompt guilty plea and mitigation had been taken into account."
736,"Guests to San Francisco's Westin St Francis Hotel still ask to see the room where an infamous bootleg-booze-soused party took place 90 years ago.  The management are happy to show visitors the suite, if it's unoccupied, but they don't know exactly what happened in there on Labor Day in 1921 - no-one does.  One thing is clear: In Room 1219 that afternoon, an actress by the name of Virginia Rappe was screaming in agony on a bed.  Later that week she was dead.  And the man charged with her death was Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, Hollywood's first one-million-dollar star.  The case against the silent movies' king of slapstick would be Tinseltown's first major scandal.  ""This was the guy who discovered Buster Keaton; who helped mentor Charlie Chaplin,"" says Arbuckle biographer Stuart Oderman. ""He had magical comic timing. He was one of the all-time greats.""  But overnight, the roly-poly buffoon adored by children across America was public enemy number one, and people were spitting in his face outside court.  It was on 5 September 1921, that Arbuckle ended up at a party in a luxury suite on the 12th floor of the St Francis, after taking a break from a hectic filming schedule.  Among the guests was Virginia Rappe, a 30-year-old struggling actress who suffered from chronic cystitis, a bladder inflammation.  At some point, Arbuckle and Rappe ended up together in a bedroom from where, a few minutes later, her screams were heard.  Guests rushed in to find Rappe, fully dressed, writhing in pain on the bed.  Arbuckle told them - it was a story he always stuck to - that he had gone to use the bathroom where he found Rappe in a drunken faint on the floor.  He had merely carried her to the bed and she had fallen off, insisted Arbuckle.  But then Rappe uttered the words that would damn the star: ""He did this to me.""  As Arbuckle left the party, revellers initially assumed the actress was just drunk.  But her condition worsened and when she was finally taken to hospital three days later her friend, Bambina Maude Delmont, told the doctor Arbuckle had raped Rappe.  A day later Rappe died from peritonitis, caused by a ruptured bladder.  Arbuckle was charged with first-degree murder, eventually reduced to manslaughter.  With morality groups demanding he face the death penalty, movie moguls ordered Arbuckle's industry friends to disown him.  Los Angeles-based film historian Cari Beauchamp says: ""This was the first scandal in Hollywood with box office implications.  ""Everyone had believed the stars were covered in fairy dust. Now that illusion was shattered and studio bosses were terrified it would destroy Hollywood itself.""  With no concern for prejudicing the trial, the sensationalist ""yellow journalism"" Press churned out lurid stories of Tinseltown's depravity alongside coverage of the case.  Although Arbuckle was never tried for sexual assault, this notion has endured, largely because of how the trial was reported at the time.  The star, thought to have weighed about 260lb (118kg), was portrayed as a fat brute who had pinned down his prey, rupturing her bladder.  Luckily for Arbuckle's lawyers, the case was riddled with holes.  His chief accuser, Bambina Maude Delmont, was a convicted criminal who had admitted plotting to extort money from him. She never took the stand.  And it emerged in court that the prosecution had used intimidation to force several witnesses to testify against Arbuckle.  Even so, the actor was tried three times. The first two cases ended in hung juries.  After a third trial in 1922, the jury took just a few minutes to unanimously acquit Arbuckle - he was found guilty only of drinking bootleg alcohol.  ""Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle,"" the jury said in a written apology. ""A grave injustice has been done.""  Although cleared, Arbuckle faced ruinous legal bills and a public still widely convinced of his guilt. He was often heckled in the street.  The case led to the establishing of a Hollywood censorship board, which ruled that Arbuckle should never work in the industry again.  Although that ban was later lifted, the actor remained blacklisted unofficially.  For Tinseltown, of course, the show went on - it survived the Arbuckle affair, just like it has weathered many other scandals since then.  As Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan says: ""Stars still get into trouble and they still need help managing crises. At least Arbuckle didn't have to deal with Twitter.""  Roscoe Arbuckle spent more than a decade on the comeback trail - during which time he worked under a pseudonym and discovered Bob Hope in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1927.  Arbuckle's rehabilitation was finally complete when Warner Bros offered him a feature-film contract in 1933.  After it was signed, he reputedly said: ""This is the best day of my life.""  That night he died of a heart attack in the arms of his third wife. He was 46 years old.  Mississippi-based Arbuckle historian David Pearson says the star was the inspiration to many overweight comics, such as John Belushi, Benny Hill, John Candy and Chris Farley.  Like many experts on the case, Pearson is convinced Arbuckle did not harm Rappe.  ""Arbuckle was just a film star who was in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" says Pearson. ""And he paid for it for the rest of his life.  ""Rappe was definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time because she wound up dead. It was a double tragedy.""  But nine decades on, the mystery remains: why did Virginia Rappe die?"
737,"Shadow Chancellor Edward Heath has beaten off his rivals in the Conservative leadership contest triggered by last week's unexpected resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Shadow Chancellor Edward Heath has beaten off his rivals in the Conservative leadership contest triggered by last week's unexpected resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Mr Heath's victory comes as a surprise - shadow Foreign Secretary Reginald Maudling had been widely tipped to win. Two polls of Tory MPs published this morning indicated a large majority intended to vote for him in today's ballot. However, in the event many backed Mr Heath instead giving him 150 votes to Mr Maudling's 133. The third challenger, maverick Enoch Powell, managed just 15 votes meaning Mr Heath had a slim overall majority. I hope to have the opportunity of working under Mr Heath's leadership to defeat the present government as soon as possible   Under Conservative Party leadership election rules Mr Maudling could have forced a second ballot but in view of Mr Heath's majority he bowed to tradition and announced his withdrawal. In a statement issued late this evening Mr Maudling said: ""I am very grateful to all the friends who have supported me but I have no doubt that it is in the interest of the party I should not continue to another ballot. ""I hope to have the opportunity of working under Mr Heath's leadership to defeat the present government as soon as possible."" Many are attributing Edward Heath's success to Mr Maudling's poor performance as Chancellor in the last Conservative government. Mr Heath formally takes over as leader in a week's time when he makes the traditional address to a meeting of Conservative peers, Young Conservatives, the party's national executive and constituency delegates.     He achieved his aim of taking Britain into the European Economic Community (EEC) but widespread industrial action and economic difficulties led to the Tories falling from power in February 1974. After he failed to lead his party back into office in another election in 1974 he was challenged for the leadership by Margaret Thatcher who had been Education Secretary in his cabinet. In February 1975 Mr Heath was forced to resign when she defeated him in the first round. Mrs Thatcher then went on to beat four other male candidates to become the first female leader of a British political party and, four years later, Britain's first woman prime minister. Edward Heath never forgave Mrs Thatcher for ousting him and refused to serve in her cabinet. He was knighted in 1992 and, after more than 50 years as a MP, retired from politics in 2001."
738,"Israel's Prime Minister designate Ehud Olmert will present his coalition to parliament, the Knesset, on Thursday.  With 25 ministers, his is one of the largest cabinets in Israel's history. But it is not quite the big bang in Israeli politics predicted by the media before the general election.  Every Israeli government is a coalition because of the nature of Israel's political system.  Following elections, the country's largest party has to decide which other political groups will best help it achieve its aims and at what cost in terms of key ministries.  After coming first in March, Ehud Olmert's Kadima party said any coalition partner would have to sign up to his plan to fix permanent borders for Israel by 2010.  Kadima's plan is viewed as bold, controversial and, according to many Israelis, improbable.  Israel celebrated its 58th birthday on Wednesday, but in all those years its borders have never been clear.  He wants to evacuate some isolated Jewish settlements in the West Bank, keeping other, larger ones and consolidating Israel's hold on East Jerusalem.  Israel occupied the land in the 1967. Under international law, all Jewish settlements are illegal - although Israeli disputes this.  After years of bloody conflict, some sections of Israeli society favour abandoning the settlements altogether. Others say not a single Jew should be uprooted, because it ""rewards Palestinian terrorists"".  Mr Olmert's plan is seen by many as a compromise between the different Israeli viewpoints. Sixty thousand out of a total of 400,000 Jews who live in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, could be forced to leave their homes.  Kadima's plan has been presented as a dramatic vision for Israel's future.  But after seeing Mr Olmert's cabinet line-up, much of the Israeli media predict the big bang will result in little more than a whimper.  His main problem is that Kadima did not do as well as hoped in the election - winning only 29 seats out of 120.  Opinion polls predicted Mr Olmert's predecessor and Kadima's founder, Ariel Sharon, would have secured 40 parliamentary seats.  The political heavyweight has been in a coma since suffering a stroke in January. Mr Olmert risks standing forever in his shadow.  Before choosing coalition partners he had to think carefully which political parties would sign up to his borders plan and not challenge his authority.  But it was also in a position to drive a hard bargain with 19 parliamentary seats to offer the Olmert government.  In the end, it secured 7 cabinet positions, including Mr Olmert's most controversial appointment: Labour leader Amir Peretz as Israel's new defence minister.  The defence portfolio is usually given to someone with a prestigious military background, not someone like Mr Peretz, a former firebrand leader of Israel's largest trade union federation.  Such an appointment is unlikely to make Israeli society feel any less vulnerable - with the militant Hamas movement having won Palestinian elections and the possibility of a nuclear threat from Iran.  Kadima and Labour may also turn out to be uncomfortable bedfellows.  In economic terms, Kadima leans to the centre-right and Labour to the centre-left.  Labour wanted the Finance Ministry to push through some costly social reforms. It failed to get it, but still insists that the minimum wage, and pension and health benefits, be raised in Israel.  In terms of security there are big differences too.  It will be interesting to see the reaction of both parties if, as Mr Abbas has indicated, he invites them to take part in an international peace conference once their government has been sworn in.  Palestinians are opposed to Israel acting unilaterally. Most are against Mr Olmert's border plan which they say will make a future united Palestinian state an impossibility.  Aside from Labour, Ehud Olmert has also signed coalition agreements with two smaller political factions: the single-issue Pensioners' Party (Gil) and the ultra-orthodox Shas.  He had initially announced that no party could join his government without agreeing to his border plan. Shas refused. But Mr Olmert invited them to join anyway.  Kadima has kept hold of 12 ministries, including the post of Prime Minister.  Rising stars in the cabinet are Tzipi Livni, who has been named deputy prime minister and is only the second Israeli woman to head the Foreign Ministry. Close Olmert allies Roni Bar-On and Abraham Kirschon have been made interior and finance ministers respectively.  With Labour, Shas and Gil on board, Ehud Olmert's government has 67 seats in Israel's parliament, enough to form a stable government - for now.  He is well aware, though, of the volatility of Israeli politics and is continuing negotiations with other factions which he could invite into the fold at a later date."
739,"US Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit threw up problems not solutions.  The ""roadmap"" for peace in the Middle East has been unrolled and Mr Powell has met both Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers.  But the parties have yet to start the journey they are supposed to be making together to reach the goal of a settlement and a Palestinian state by 2005.  The first stage of the map envisages Israel freezing settlements, pulling its army back to pre-intifada positions and the Palestinians cracking down on the suicide bombers of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.  ""Our finest youth live there. They are already the third generation, contributing to the state and serving in elite army units. They return home and get married, so then they can't build a house and have children?"" he is quoted as saying.  ""What do you want, for a pregnant woman to have an abortion just because she is a settler?"" he asked.  Also at the lunch were two of Mr Sharon's ministers who exemplify the resistance from the Israeli right wing to any agreement which gives the Palestinians a state west of the River Jordan or uproots any Israeli settlements.  One of them, the Housing Minister Effi Eitam is a former general and heads the National Religious Party. He has even called Israeli Arabs, who hold Israeli citizenship, a ""cancer.""  The Transport Minister Avigdor Lieberman once described the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who nearly reached an agreement with Yasser Arafat, as ""simply insane.""  Israel was urged by Mr Powell to make life easier for Palestinians. So it has lifted some restrictions of entry into Israel for workers from West Bank, but it has at the same time put Gaza under an even tighter grip. Israel's problem is that the more it lifts restrictions, the easier it makes it for the bombers to strike.  For his part, the new Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) has accepted the roadmap in principle but now faces the practical problem of preventing suicide attacks on Israel.  It was a series of such attacks which destroyed the Oslo agreements, signed on the White House lawn in September 1993 amidst great optimism.  And yet Hamas has again rejected any attempt to stop it.  Hamas official Ismail Abu Shanab is quoted by Radio Monte Carlo as saying: "" We say that Abu Mazen is betraying the Palestinian people's struggle and jihad in order to appease the USA and to avoid angering Israel.  ""The Palestinian arena rejects this. The blood of our people and martyrs was shed for freedom. It is not terrorism against anyone.""  The problem for Abu Mazen is that the tighter the Israeli grip on the Palestinian territories, the more support there is for Hamas and Islamic Jihad.  Israeli papers are gloomy about the map. In Ma'ariv, one commentator wrote: ""Sharon has already made it clear that he will not respond to the condition (the principle of a two states for two peoples) unless the Palestinians concede in advance the 'right of return'. Since the chances of this happening are at best slim, the map can be folded from the start.""  The ""right of return"" is for Palestinians a very sensitive issue. It involves giving up the claim of Palestinian refugees to go back to their original towns and villages. This claim, say the Palestinians, must be part of the negotiations, not given up from the start.  The state of play will become more evident after Mr Sharon's forthcoming visit to Washington and an expected meeting between Mr Sharon and Abu Mazen.  The only sign of hope must be that in the post Saddam era in the Middle East, the United States is showing a new willingness to engage in the Israeli/Palestinian dispute.  Yet the problems themselves have not changed.  This track is an old one. Everyone knows its every twist and turn already, new roadmap or not."
740,"Animator Mark Hall, co-founder of Cosgrove Hall, responsible for Chorlton and the Wheelies, Danger Mouse and The Wind in the Willows, has died of cancer at the age of 74.  He died in the early hours of Friday at his home in Manchester surrounded by his family, his company Cosgrove Hall Fitzpatrick Entertainment said.  Operations director Adrian Wilkins hailed ""a lifetime of achievement"" in the world of animation.  ""He is one of life's gentlemen.""  Hall, together with Brian Cosgrove, set up production company Stop Frame in the late 1960s before forming Cosgrave Hall Films.  They enjoyed international success with their productions which also included Danger Mouse spin-off Count Duckula, Jamie and the Magic Torch and Cockleshell Bay.  Danger Mouse - voiced by Only Fools and Horses actor David Jason - was joined in his quest to defeat the evil Baron Greenback by bumbling sidekick Penfold, voiced by Terry and June star Terry Scott.  In 2006, the 25th anniversary year of Danger Mouse, Hall told the BBC that the programme had succeeded because of the strange scenarios the pair found themselves in.  ""The adults watched because of that kind of anarchy,"" he said.  ""The kids watched it because they just loved the stories and the absolutely stupid gags.""  He praised Jason's ""fantastic"" voicing of Danger Mouse as well as Scott's ""wonderful"" Penfold.  He said that Danger Mouse, who lived inside a postbox in London's Baker Street, was ""a sort of cross between Bond and all sorts of things"".  ""He was supposed to be suave but he was a mouse with big ears.""  The show, produced by Cosgrove Hall for Thames TV, attracted an average audience of 3.5 million when it was first shown in the UK on ITV.  It has since been seen in more than 80 countries.  Cosgrove Hall went out of business two years ago but both Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall came out of retirement this year to form Cosgrove Hall Fitzpatrick Entertainment (CHF) with Francis Fitzpatrick, creator of children's TV hit Jakers!  The company has created a new character Pip! which it says could create at least 75 jobs in the Manchester area when production gets under way.  They have also created new series The HeroGliffix, a set of ""so-called super heroes"" who have ""paws with flaws that get in the way of their superpowers in the most inconvenient and comical ways"".  CHF's Adrian Wilkins said: ""Mark was instrumental in designing the two new TV shows which we're taking to market now which are, if you like, his legacy.  ""And he actually saw the Cosgrove Hall name resurrected which was the nicest tribute we could give to him.""  Mr Wilkins added: ""One of our fellow directors summed it up the other day and said, when the history of animation is written you'll have the likes of Walt Disney up there, [Bob the Builder] Keith Chapman etc.  ""But Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall are going to be in the lifetime hall of fame for their contribution to the animation industry."""
741,"   Jèrriais and Sercquiais today   The status of Jèrriais   The history of Jèrriais and Sercquiais   Jèrriais and Sercquiais today by Dr Mari C Jones You may be surprised to learn that Norman French is spoken natively in part of the British Isles. Each of the Channel Islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Sark has its own native dialect, all of which are closely related to the dialects spoken in Normandy. However, as each of the Island dialects has its own characteristics in vocabulary and pronunciation, a speaker from one Island cannot automatically understand a speaker from another, nor can it be assumed they will easily understand mainland Norman, nor indeed be understood by speakers of Standard French. Jèrriais and Sercquiais are, respectively, the Norman French dialects spoken on Jersey and Sark. Even though Sark is geographically close to Guernsey, Sercquiais is related more to Jèrriais than to Guernesiais (the dialect of Guernsey) since it developed from a form of Jèrriais after Sark was colonised from Jersey in 1565. Auregnais, the dialect of Alderney, became extinct in the twentieth century. If you are able to speak Standard French, you will recognise many of the same features in Jèrriais and Sercquiais. This is because Standard French is closely related to these dialects. However, you may also be surprised to find that there are a number of noteworthy differences. For example, in both Jèrriais and Sercquiais a singular-plural distinction is made in words such as baté - batchieaux ('boat'; Jèrriais spelling used). This distinction is absent from spoken French, which has bateau - bateaux (both pronounced 'bato'). Another distinctive feature is the use of jé as both the first person singular pronoun ('I') and the first person plural pronoun ('we'). Standard French, of course, has a different pronoun in each case ('je' and 'nous'). Speaker Numbers  Even a brief visit to Jersey and Sark will leave you in no doubt that, today, English is their dominant language. The 2001 Census of Jersey recorded that, at that time, 2,874 of the Island's 87,186 inhabitants (3.3%) were able to speak Jèrriais, with some two-thirds of these speakers aged over 60. The Census also recorded that only 113 speakers declared Jèrriais to be their usual everyday language. Information about speakers of Sercquiais has never been gathered officially but in 1998 it was estimated that, at that time, fewer than 20 out of the Island's 600 permanent inhabitants (3.3%) were still able to speak Sercquiais.Dialect Variations  One fascinating feature of Jèrriais is that, despite the fact that Jersey measures only 10.8 miles by 6.8, Jèrriais is not spoken in the same way throughout the Island. The different local varieties of Jèrriais are known as parlers. They differ from one another in terms of the way that certain sounds are pronounced and it is also common to find different words being used for the same object across the Island. These include words such as 'spider', which is 'pêtre' in West Jersey and 'aithangnie' in East Jersey. Despite these local differences, speakers of Jèrriais from different parts of Jersey have no difficulty in understanding one another. Even though Sark is only 2 square miles in size, it seems that Sercquiais too, had at least two distinctive local varieties. However, by today, Sercquiais is relatively homogeneous.   "
742,"Congestion fees are to be introduced on some roads in the Chinese capital Beijing in a bid to tackle chronic traffic problems, state media report.  Officials hope that the charges will encourage more people to use public transport, Xinhua news agency says.  The city is also reportedly planning to encourage residents to buy alternative-energy cars.  Few details of the new measures have been given, but Beijing has long tried to tackle its congestion troubles.  The capital has 4.8m registered vehicles, and residents say the traffic jams are sometimes so bad the roads resemble car parks.  Xinhua did not specify how high the new toll fees would be, which roads would be affected and how the fees would be collected.  But it did report on Beijing's plans to upgrade equipment at electric-vehicle charging stations and to build more of them in the hope of encouraging the purchase of new-energy cars, including electric vehicles.  Beijing officials have been trying to tackle the problem of congestion since the Beijing Olympics in 2008.  Measures have included restricting car purchases, increasing parking fees, widening roads and expanding its subway system.  But the city is trying to balance its traffic problems with the desire of a growing middle class to have the convenience and status of car ownership, observers say.  China overtook the US as the world's biggest car and van market in 2009, with 13.6 million vehicles sold within the country."
743,"The two tunnels which run under the River Thames between Dartford in Kent and Thurrock in Essex were closed from 0100 BST to 0600 BST on Sunday.  A simulated incident tested the emergency services, Highways Agency and local authorities in Kent and Essex.  Diversions were put in place during the five-hour safety exercise.  Northbound traffic had to leave the M25 at junction two, follow the A2 through the Blackwall Tunnel, and then take the A102 and A13 back to junction 30 of the motorway.  Vehicles over 4m (13.1ft) in height and those carrying hazardous goods had to travel clockwise around the M25 to reach their destination.  Southbound traffic using the QEII Bridge over the Thames was unaffected.  John Aspinall, from the Highways Agency, said: ""It is vital to ensure that in the case of a real emergency all the parties involved operate in an efficient manner to safeguard the public.  ""Holding Exercise Orpheus means the authorities' response to a real emergency would be swift and practiced."""
744,"Teachers at a primary school have been told not to mark children's work in red ink because it encourages a ""negative approach"".  In future, pupils at Uplands Manor Primary School in Smethwick, West Midlands, will see their mistakes struck through with a green pen.  Critics have condemned the change as ""politically correct"" and ""trendy"".  But Penny Penn-Howard, head of school improvement for Sandwell Council, said: ""The colour of the pen used for marking is not greatly significant except that the red pen has negative connotations and can be seen as a negative approach to improving pupils' work.  ""Therefore, it is quite legitimate for a school to have a consistent policy that it uses a different colour.""  The red pen goes further back than most schools, having been developed during the mid-19th Century, when ammonia-based dyes became available.  The school took the decision to introduce green ink independently of the local authority.  Frank Betteridge, Conservative education spokesman on Sandwell Council, said: ""Ever since people have written in coloured ink, blue has meant credit and red has meant debit.  ""Children are not gullible. They will soon realise that green means the same as red used to.  ""If it's a question in maths or spelling, it's either right or wrong. That needs to be emphasised.  ""The remarks on the page should tell children where they are going right or wrong.""  Uplands Manor, which has 630 pupils, denied green ink had been introduced to prevent hurt feelings.  But Nick Seaton, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ""If you use red ink, pupils can see straight away where they have gone wrong and where they can do better.  ""Children have to learn to take life's ups and downs. Banning red ink is a rather trendy and politically correct idea."""
745,"Barney was in confident form throughout the whole match Raymond van Barneveld completed the first ever nine-dart finish in the PDC World Championship to crush Jelle Klaasen 5-1 and reach the last four. The five-time world champion was in imperious form as he achieved the feat in the second leg of the sixth set and sealed victory with a 161 checkout. Van Barneveld will face third seed James Wade in Saturday's semi-final. Wade was less than impressive but still had too much for Australia-based Englishman Paul Nicholson, winning 5-3. After struggling to beat Ronnie Baxter in the last 16 and losing the first set to his compatriot, Van Barneveld was under some pressure but upped his game to devastating effect. He rattled off six legs in a row to go 2-1 ahead and then took a 3-1 lead thanks to a 91 checkout on the Klaasen throw. From then on there was no way back for the 2006 BDO world champion, and Van Barneveld checked out on 116 and 96 on his way to taking the fifth set. But the Dutchman saved the best until last with two consecutive 180s to start the second leg of the sixth set and with the Alexandra Palace crowd roaring him on, he hit another treble 20 and followed that up with treble 19 before sealing the feat with double 12. It was the second nine-dart finish of Van Barneveld's career after he achieved it against Peter Manley in the Premier League in 2006 and it earns the Dutchman a £20,000 bonus. ""I was full of confidence despite losing the first set,"" he said afterwards. ""I was getting in my own zone and I was so focused on that treble 20 all the time. ""To have a nine-darter in the World Championship is massive. I am very proud to become the first one to do it in this World Championship. Wade struggled with an average of only 81.75 in the match ""I was lucky to be here after Ronnie missed with two darts for 67 to win the other night. But I have had to dig in deep this last year and keep believing in myself, and what I have done in the last few months has come out on the stage here."" The excitement of the all-Dutch encounter contrasted with the night's opening quarter-final where both players struggled to make an impact on the game. Nicholson failed to take his chances early on as Wade claimed the opening two sets but Nicholson pulled a set back before Wade stretched his advantage again, thanks to checkouts of 135 and 64 en route to making it 3-1. However, the third seed was broken at the start of the fifth set and went on to lose the next six legs to enable the world 126 to level the match at 3-3. But Wade found a glimpse of form when he most needed it, hitting two successive 180s on his way to securing the seventh set before he completed the victory in the eighth with a double two. ""I'm pleased to have got through but it was a poor performance, much below the standard I set myself,"" said Wade. ""I don't know what went wrong, because I felt fine before the game, but I've got 24 hours to put it right."" The first semi-final on Saturday will see number one seed Phil Taylor take on Mervyn King."
746,"The Glasgow club will receive an initial payment of £18m on 7 June, when they launch their new Umbro home kit.  A guaranteed minimum annual royalty of £3m will be received by Rangers in each year of the licence.  Rangers chairman David Murray said: ""It will allow for the reduction of the club's debt and enable further investment to be made in the team.""  Murray, who had promised a major announcement once his side were out of the Champions League, said the club's facilities would also benefit.  But there is sure to be job losses, with the present Rangers Shop chain, which employs 200 people, likely to close.  Rangers say they ""will now enter into a period of consultation with the affected staff"".  The agreement will allow JJB, who already have tie-ins with Wigan Athletic and Everton, to retail all Rangers' branded sports and leisurewear in their 439 stores across the UK.  As well as the guaranteed £3m royalties each year, Rangers will also be given additional payments when certain levels of turnover are met by the sports company.  ""The arrangement capitalises on our strong current retail trading position and will enhance future revenue streams through greater availability and continuity of the quality and range of Rangers product,"" added Murray.  Rangers announced net debts of £23.1m in the summer and will, of course, lose the revenue their club shops were generating.  However, Rangers are not yet saying anything about a successor to Alex McLeish as manager.  Former Lyon coach Paul Le Guen is reported to have agreed a two-year contract and an announcement of that could be triggered by confirmation of the latest investment.  McLeish, who took Rangers further in the Champions League than any previous Scottish side before Tuesday's exit in Villarreal, has already announced that he will be standing down at the end of the season.  But, when asked if it was possible he could leave earlier, he has simply replied that ""I'm here until someone tells me otherwise"".  That appears to leave open the possibility of Le Guen taking charge for the run-in to a disappointing domestic campaign.  Rangers, already out of both cup competitions, lie third, well adrift of leaders Celtic, also behind Hearts, and in danger of missing out on qualification for next season's Champions League.  Fans representative David Edgar believes it is time for Murray to make his intentions clear.  ""There's no point in this dragging on now,"" the Rangers Trust spokesman told BBC Sport.  ""Rangers are going to have to give the fans something to invest their season ticket money in sooner rather than later."""
747,"The scene of the attack in the province of Baghlan was left littered with bodies and splattered with blood in one of the worst attacks in recent times.  The attack was condemned by the Afghan president, the White House and the UN.  Analysts say suicide attacks are rare in this area, and the bombing shows the reach of the insurgency is growing.  The Taleban, al-Qaeda and other militant groups are fighting thousands of Afghan and foreign troops in Afghanistan.  The bomb exploded at a sugar factory in a town in Baghlan province while a delegation of parliamentarians was visiting - at least six of whom died.  Among the MPs killed was Mustafa Kazimi, a former mujahideen fighter and prominent opposition figure.  Schoolchildren who had gathered to welcome the politicians were also killed.  ""I saw bodies lying in the streets and some of the people were stealing the weapons of the dead soldiers,"" local resident Mohammad Rahim told Reuters news agency.  ""Children are screaming for help. It's like a nightmare,"" said Mr Rahim, who said the blast had killed his two cousins, both schoolgirls.  The deputy mayor of Baghlan province said that two disembodied legs were all that remained of the bomber following the attack. The bomber's identity is unknown.  The head of hospitals in Baghlan, Yousuf Faiz, told AFP news agency 40 dead and 120 wounded had been registered at four hospitals.  Meanwhile provincial security chief Abdurrahman Sayedkhail told Reuters he was aware of 50 dead, though some relatives had taken bodies away themselves.  President Karzai condemned the ""heinous"" attack - one of the worst since the ousting of the Taleban in 2001 - ""in the strongest possible terms"", he said in a statement.  ""It is the work of the enemies of peace and security in Afghanistan,"" he said.  The attack was ""a despicable act of cowardice and it reminds us who the enemy is"", said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino.  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed ""his continuing anxiety regarding the unstable security situation throughout Afghanistan"".  A Taleban spokesman condemned the attack and denied the Taleban were behind it.  However, suicide bombs in Afghanistan have until now been exclusively the work of the Taleban and al-Qaeda, our correspondent says.  Until now, most suicide attacks have taken place in the south and east of Afghanistan or, less frequently, in Kabul.  But the UN says the number of suicide attacks is rising sharply. Insurgent attacks have also been on the increase in areas of central and even northern Afghanistan - where violence had tended to take the form of common crime rather than political attacks, says our correspondent.  Fighters loyal to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar - a former mujahideen leader who is battling the Kabul government independently from the Taleban - are known to be active in Baghlan, says BBC analyst Pam O'Toole.  Civilians have often been the victims of the violence in Afghanistan - not only in attacks by insurgents, but also in strikes by the foreign Nato and US forces in the country."
748,"Update 4 November 2010: This blog post was the subject of a complaint by the Band Aid Trust. A BBC investigation upheld the complaint - click here for details.  An edition of the BBC World Service programme Assignment, alleging that money intended for famine relief in Ethiopia in the mid-1980s was used to buy weapons, has prompted an angry response from aid campaigners.  Andrew Whitehead, Editor, News and Current Affairs at the BBC World Service, explains how the story came about.  A quarter of a century ago, the BBC's Michael Buerk achieved something very rare - he not only reported the world, but changed it a little bit.  His vivid on-the-spot coverage of a famine ""of biblical proportions"" in Tigray in northern Ethiopia pricked the conscience of the richer part of the world.  The money came pouring in. Bob Geldof's Band Aid and Live Aid led the way in galvanising public attention, raising cash and mobilising a huge relief effort.  As a result, many thousands of lives were saved - and tens of thousands of those facing starvation received food.  In the past week, the BBC World Service has broadcast an Assignment documentary - you can listen to it here - based on the testimony of key figures on the ground in and around Tigray in the mid-1980s.  It presents evidence, compelling evidence, that some of the famine relief donations were diverted by a powerful rebel group to buy weapons.  The documentary has revealed some uncomfortable facts and provoked a strong response. This morning a British newspaper, The Independent, gives over its front page to complaints from Bob Geldof and several leading charities. They accuse the BBC of ""disgracefully poor reporting"".  The suggestion of aid money being to diverted to buy arms is ""palpable nonsense"", in the words of Phil Bloomer, director of Oxfam's campaigns and policy division.  Geldof goes further. ""This is a Ross/Brand moment in BBC standards for me,"" he told The Independent. ""It is a disgrace.""  OK, so let's stand back a moment. This documentary was put together by Martin Plaut, Africa Editor at BBC World Service News.  He has a particular expertise in the Horn of Africa, and indeed reported from there on the famine back in the 1980s. He has spent almost a year gathering material and doing research for this documentary - and the BBC stands by his journalism.  As so often is the case, the famine that afflicted northern Ethiopia was compounded by war. Much of Tigray was controlled by a hard left-wing rebel group, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. They were fighting the Ethiopian army, then the largest in Africa.  This was also the era of the cold war - and the Americans were seeking to undermine the Soviet-aligned Ethiopian government.  It is not in dispute that millions of dollars of relief aid was channelled through the Relief Society of Tigray (Rest), which was a part of the TPLF rebel movement. It was the only way of reaching those in desperate need in rebel-held areas. What Martin Plaut's documentary uncovers is the systematic diversion of aid received by Rest to buy arms for the TPLF.  Martin tracked down two key former members of the TPLF who explained how they managed to divert the money.  They are now at odds with the then TPLF leader, Meles Zenawi, who is currently Ethiopia's Prime Minister. But they are credible voices.  One of these former TPLF fighters, the rebel army commander at the time, makes an allegation which has attracted particular controversy - that the organisation made a policy decision that only 5% of the money received by Rest would be spent on relief, with the bulk going directly or indirectly to support their military and political campaigns.  Among the other accounts featured in the World Service programme, Robert Houdek, who was the senior US diplomat in Ethiopia in the late 1980s, states that TPLF members told him at the time that some aid money and supplies was used to buy weapons. A CIA document paints the same picture.  Bob Geldof was given every opportunity to express his point of view while the documentary was being made, but declined to be interviewed.  Some relief agencies - including Christian Aid and Cafod - pointed us towards their staff involved in directing food supplies 25 years ago, and those voices were included.  Two key aid workers active in and around Ethiopia in the 1980s confirm in the BBC World Service programme the way in which relief was channelled through Rest - though they dispute that there was a significant diversion of money for arms buying.  ""If we were being conned, I think it was on a very small scale,"" said Stephen King, then overseeing from Sudan the work of Catholic charities in providing food to the starving.  The documentary did not say that most famine relief money was used to buy weapons - it did not suggest that any relief agencies were complicit in the diversion of funds - it explicitly stated that ""whatever the levels of deception, much aid did reach the starving"".  But there is a clear public interest in determining whether some money given as famine relief ended up buying guns and bullets.  And that's what the evidence suggests.  Peter Horrocks is the director of BBC Global News.  Update 4 November 2010: The BBC’s Editorial Complaints Unit upheld a complaint from the Band Aid Trust about this blog post.  The complaint said:    • By using phrases such as ""key figures"", ""compelling evidence"", ""uncomfortable facts"", ""uncovers systematic diversion of aid"" and ""credible voices"" the article gave unwarranted support to allegations which were not sufficiently corroborated.   • The article gave support to the allegation that ""95% of the money received by Rest was spent on military and political campaigns"" when this allegation was not sufficiently corroborated.  The finding:   • The article gave a misleading impression that there was evidence of large-scale diversion of Band Aid money.   • The article was not clear about the extent to which the credibility of the claim of 95% diversion of aid by Rest was open to question.

749,"Witnesses said at least eight people were killed in the fighting.  Some reports say the Union of Islamic Courts has captured the strategically located settlement of Bandiradley, near the border with the Puntland region.  Semi-autonomous Puntland has escaped much of the anarchy, which has ravaged southern Somalia since 1991.  The Union of Islamic Courts militia has made a rapid advance through southern Somalia since capturing the capital Mogadishu in June.  But it has stopped short of seizing Baidoa in the south - the headquarters of the transitional government - which the neighbouring Ethiopian army has pledged to protect.  The Islamic Courts and local residents said the militia had taken control of Bandiradley, in Mudug region, after heavy fighting.  But a spokesman for Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, the warlord who controls the area, told AFP news agency his troops had only retreated tactically.  Mohamed Mohamud Jama, an Islamic Courts spokesman in Mudug, told the agency they were now planning to march on Galkayo, a major town in Puntland to the north.  The Islamists have so far resisted moving into Puntland, which runs its own affairs and has its own well-armed militia."
750,"Well-organised Australia were relentless in their tackling of Barbarians Australia's superb defence was the springboard for a hard-fought win over a star-studded Barbarians side in the Olympic Centenary match at Wembley. The Wallabies withstood strong early pressure for Ryan Cross to create a 12th-minute try for Lote Tuqiri. Teenage debutant James O'Connor kicked available points but a mistake let Shane Williams set up Jerry Collins for a second-half Barbarians score. But Australia sealed victory with a brilliant Lachie Turner try late on. The result means Australia go home having won four of their six tour matches, beating Italy, England and France but losing to New Zealand and Wales. The match was organised as part of the British Olympic Association's celebrations of the centenary of the first Olympics in London, where the Games will return in four years' time. Australia took the rugby union gold medal in 1908 with a 32-3 victory over Great Britain, represented by the English county of Cornwall. In honour of that match, the Barbarians all wore yellow Cornwall socks as they departed from their usual tradition of players wearing their club socks. Modern professional rugby has made the Baa-Baas a bit of a sideshow but it's still an honour to play for them as judging by the selection of the high quality team    In the ninth minute, Springbok wing Bryan Habana, one of seven members of South Africa's World Cup-winning side in the Barbarians' starting XV, broke clear and chipped ahead. Illustrating Australia's alertness and strength in defence, his kick was fielded near Australia's line by Lote Tuqiri who, despite pressure from New Zealand captain Richie McCaw, grounded the ball for a five-metre scrum. Minutes later Tuqiri, making his first start since knee surgery after this year's Tri-Nations, opened the scoring after wing Cross burst down the right touchline from deep in his own half and his clever cross-kick inside was gathered up by Tuqiri, who strolled in under the posts. Full-back O'Connor added the conversion on what was his first start for the Wallabies and the 18-year-old soon stretched Australia's lead to 13-0 with a couple of penalties. The Barbarians, with South Africa lock Bakkies Botha a powerful presence, did start to gain ground and were rewarded with two penalties from Percy Montgomery - the Springboks' record points scorer. Habana and All Black wing Joe Rokocoko caught the Wallabies cold with a neat exchange of passes which took the Barbarians to within sight of the try-line, while Samoa prop Census Johnston and Botha both went close with referee Chris White calling on the video referee. But, with the television pictures proving inconclusive, no try was awarded. Tuqiri's early try gave Australia crucial momentum on which to build On the hour, former Australia captain George Gregan came off the Baa-Baas' bench to face his compatriots and, soon after, Australia outside-half Quade Cooper's poor kick out of defence gave possession back to the Barbarians. Francois Steyn, playing at outside-half, threw a long cut-out pass to Wales wing Williams, on as a half-time replacement for Montgomery, who sprinted clear down the touchline to take several Australians out of the game. He then put a well-timed pass inside to All Black flanker Collins, who went over for the try, but Steyn missed the conversion and then pushed a penalty wide of the posts with eight minutes left. Victory was sealed two minutes from time by replacement Turner's breakaway try after Steyn, who missed two goalkicks, was turned over. Worryingly for Australia, props Matt Dunning, who exited on a stretcher, and Sekope Kepu both went off early in the second-half after the Barbarians demolished a Wallaby scrum."
751,"Plans to create a rail test track in Nottinghamshire could help provide passenger services to some villages.  There have been ongoing calls for an extension to the Robin Hood Line, which runs between Nottingham and Worksop.  But a study in 2000 concluded a branch line to Warsop, Edwinstowe, Ollerton and Tuxford would be uneconomic.  Network Rail said making the Thoresby Colliery line into a test track could boost chances for passenger services as it will be fully maintained.  The company, which runs the UK's rail tracks and infrastructure, will use the Thoresby Colliery to High Marnham line to assess new plant and equipment.  Last month county and city councillors were told the growth in housing and business use near the route, along with a reduction in running costs, had made the financial case for the extension more attractive."
752,"A group of morris dancers from Chepstow have been invited to represent Wales in a Celtic music festival in France.  The Widders - a 'border morris' group of 30 members formed in 2001 - are due to attend the International Summer Carnival in Steenvoorde, northern France.  Border morris dancers from the Welsh - English borders would traditionally dance to supplement their meagre incomes. They would usually come together at Christmas and Easter time.  Dancers wear hats and jackets decorated with rags and ribbons and leg bells and usually dance with sticks.  Traditionally, border dancers would quite often blacken their faces as a means of disguise because the dancing was a form of begging which was frowned upon.  Today, border morris dancing is enjoying a revival and the Widders perform regularly at festivals throughout the Spring and Summer and meet up every week between April and September in Caldicot to practise their dancing, sing, play music and enjoy themselves.  When the group formed in 2001, some of the members were bikers. The name Widders was suggested by one of the biker contingent who said they looked like the 'Black Widows', a bike gang from the Clint Eastwood film 'Every Which Way But Loose'.  The phrase 'ween am the widders' - Chepstow dialect for 'we are the widows' - was coined and so the The Widders border morris team were born.  Mike Lewis, founder member of the Widders, says that a typical performance consists of 12 dances.  The dancers are accompanied by one melodeon player, two drummers, a banjo and a guitar player. He describes their dancing as dynamic and energetic, a mixture of polkas and hornpipes.  The group was thrilled to receive an invitation to perform at the International Summer Carnival in Steenvoorde in Flanders in April after organisers spotted their website and were impressed by their unique style of dancing.  They'll also hold dance workshops for local children during the carnival.  The festival is well know for its procession of giants, large characters created to commemorate celebrated local historical figures.  This year's festival will be a celebration of Celtic arts and music. The French government is contributing towards the cost of the group attending the festival and they'll be staying with French families.  The Widders will be performing the Mari Lwyd (Grey Mare) during the festival. The Mari Lwyd is a traditional new year's celebration associated with south east Wales. The Mari Lwyd is a mare's skull attached to a pole and covered by sheets concealing the people carrying it.  The Mari Lwyd is traditionally carried around a village by a group who visit houses singing songs. The residents of the house and the Mari group often take part in a rhyme contest or 'pwnco'.  Each January The Widders meet with a group of English wassailers on the bridge in Chepstow and sing and dance before performing the traditional pwnco at Chepstow castle.  Mike Lewis admits that the Widders are really looking forward to their trip to Steenvoorde.  ""As a group we're really honoured to represent Wales in France. We're gong to perform the Mari Lwyd whilst we're there and we'll be holding dance workshops so that local children can learn our dances."""
753,"Tameside Council has granted planning permission for the store, which is expected to open in Ashton-under-Lyne in October, creating about 500 jobs.  Councillor Kieran Quinn, from Tameside Council, said it was likely to attract other businesses to the area.  Ikea failed twice to get permission to build a store in Stockport.  The company had appealed to the high court after Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott twice blocked the development, but the appeal was rejected in February last year.  The Ashton-under-Lyne store is planned to be built on the corner of Wellington Road and Oldham Road.  Mr Quinn,Tameside Council's executive member for jobs and new investment, said: ""It's brilliant news for Greater Manchester.

""It's fantastic news for Ikea and all our customers in Greater Manchester."""
754,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. At least 92 people are now known to have died in China's worst coal mine accident in two years, state media say. Another 16 miners are missing after the blast at Xinxing pit in Hegang City in Heilongjiang province. The toll has more than doubled from 42 dead earlier. Some 528 workers were in the mine when the blast hit before dawn on Saturday local time, said Xinhua. A top official, Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang, has been sent to oversee rescue efforts at the state-owned mine. President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao had also been in contact with rescue workers, state media said. China's mines are notoriously dangerous. The central government has made improving safety standards a priority, but rules are often ignored in favour of profit. The blast in the mine, in the region bordering Russia, occurred at 0230 local time on Saturday (1830 GMT on Friday). More than 400 people managed to escape. Many of the injured were being treated at the Hegang Mining Bureau Hospital, which said all 800 of its medical workers had joined the rescue operation, Xinhua reported. Rescue official Zhang Fucheng was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying that attempts to reach the trapped miners were being hampered by dense gas and collapsed tunnels. No-one has been rescued alive since Sunday morning. But a spokesman for the mining company, San Jingguang, said he believed the remaining 16 men were still alive and that rescuing them was the ""first priority"". The BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing says it appears that a build-up of gas was the cause of the explosion. One of the rescued miners, Wang Xingang, said the blast knocked him out briefly. ""When I regained consciousness, I groped my way out in the dark and called for help,"" Xinhua quoted him as saying. The mine is operated by the state-owned Heilongjiang Longmei Mining Holding Group and has an annual capacity of 1.45m tonnes of coal, said Xinhua. The authorities are likely to be concerned that the accident happened in a state-run mine, says our correspondent. They are generally considered to be safer than private collieries, whose lax safety standards have contributed to a high rate of accidents. Most incidents are blamed on a failure to follow safety guidelines, often in an attempt to cut costs and meet an increasing demand for fuel. The Chinese authorities have been trying to deal with the dangers by closing smaller mining operations and forcing local authorities to regulate the industry. The government closed some 1,000 small mines in a recent safety drive, and says the number of miners killed has been halved as a result. But miners are still dying at a rate of six a day, and independent labour groups say many accidents are covered up in the drive for profit and coal. In February, more than 70 workers were killed in an explosion at a mine in Shanxi province.     "

756,"Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson caused offence when he described a car as ""speciale needs"" - a play on its proper name, Ferrari F430 Speciale.  However, it did not censure the BBC as the broadcaster had deleted the comment from repeats and the iPlayer version, and apologised for causing offence.  Clarkson described the car owned by co-presenter James May as looking ""like a simpleton"".  In response to Ofcom's inquiry, the BBC said his description was a ""light hearted reference to the look of the car (the front of which has the appearance of a broad smile) in contrast to a newer model, which was praised by Mr Clarkson.""  In its ruling, Ofcom said: ""The BBC said that it was the car itself that was the subject of the fun being poked at and its owner... James May.""  The episode of the popular motoring show was broadcast at 2130 BST on 1 August - a fact Ofcom took into account, saying that viewers should expect programmes ""to contain more challenging content and humour after the watershed"".  Ofcom ruled that ""the comments made by Jeremy Clarkson in this instance were capable of causing offence.""  It went on: ""While obviously intended as a joke and not aimed directly at an individual with learning difficulties, the comment could easily be understood as ridiculing people in society with a particular physical disability or learning difficulty.""  It said it acknowledged that Top Gear was ""well known for its irreverent style and sometimes outspoken humour and banter between the presenters"".  In concluding that the investigation was resolved, it said that the BBC had acted immediately and voluntarily in removing the comment from repeat screenings and the iPlayer.  ""It had also apologised for any offence caused by the comments, underlining that there was no intent to make fun of those with special needs.""  Last year it censured the show for depicting a graphic - albeit spoof - suicide.  The previous year complaints about another joke by Clarkson, about lorry drivers killing prostitutes, were not upheld."

""At this stage we believe that a moving train drove into the back of a stationary train on platform 6 at the station, and we are currently looking into the circumstances to determine how this happened"", British Transport Police said.  The trains involved were the 15:42 Plymouth to Paddington high speed train and the 13:39 Penzance to Exeter train, a spokesperson for Great Western Railway said.  ""Investigations are still ongoing, but eyewitnesses have suggested the speed of the collision was less than 10mph.""  Police have advised people to avoid the station if possible, and said delays were likely for passengers travelling through the Plymouth area."
758,"Sex and relationships education is to be made compulsory in all schools in England, the government has announced.  All children from the age of four will be taught about safe and healthy relationships, Education Secretary Justine Greening said.  Children will also be taught, at an appropriate age, about sex. But parents will still have the right to withdraw their children from these classes.  Until now, sex education has been compulsory only in council-run schools.  Since academies and free schools are not under local authority control, they do not have to follow the national curriculum and have not been obliged to teach sex and relationships education (SRE).  In practice, the vast majority do teach the subject - the government's announcement will mean all schools across the system will be bound by the same obligation.  Age-appropriate lessons will have particular emphasis on what constitutes healthy relationships, as well as the dangers of sexting, online pornography and sexual harassment.  In primary schools, the focus would be on building healthy relationships and staying safe, the Department for Education (DfE) said, while in secondary school it would focus on sex as well as relationships.  The government will hold discussions on what should be taught to children, and at what age, and there will be a public consultation later this year.  Pupils could be taught the new curriculum from September 2019, the DfE said.  In an interview with the BBC, Ms Greening said: ""At the moment, many schools teach sex and relationships education.  ""But it's not mandatory, and, therefore, for many children, they are not coming out of our schools really being equipped to deal with the modern world or indeed be safe and protected from some of the very modern challenges that young people face on cyberbullying and sexting.  ""What we're introducing today is mandatory relationships and sex education in all secondary schools, but also mandatory relationships education in primary schools as well.  ""And, of course, all of this, it's important, is age-appropriate and, of course, it's also important to retain, for sex education, a parent's right to withdraw their child.""  Ms Greening said schools would have flexibility over how they delivered the subjects and faith schools would continue to be able to teach in accordance with the tenets of their faith.  The current guidance for SRE, introduced in 2000, was outdated, she added.  The news was welcomed by the Local Government Association, which has been campaigning for compulsory sex education in all schools.  Izzi Seccombe, chairman of the association's community wellbeing board, said: ""The lack of compulsory SRE in secondary academies and free schools is storing up problems for later on in life, creating a ticking sexual health time bomb, as we are seeing in those who have recently left school.  ""We believe that making SRE compulsory in all secondary schools, not just council-maintained ones, could make a real difference in reversing this trend, by preparing pupils for adulthood and enabling them to better take care of themselves and future partners.""  But critics fear the announcement weakens the influence of parents.  The organisation Christian Concern said it was not for the state to prescribe what was taught in this area.  Chief executive Andrea Williams told the BBC: ""Children need to be protected, and certainly when they're [still at primary school], we need to be guarding their innocence.  ""We need to be protecting them from things, working with parents to ensure that what they might need to know - which will be different for every child child, different in every context across the country - is properly looked at.  ""But this is something that should be individualised, not something that the state can deliver wholesale.""  Safe at School Campaign, run by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, described the announcement as a ""tragedy"".  National co-ordinator Antonia Tully said: ""Parents will be absolutely powerless to protect their children from presentations of sexual activity, which we know is part of many sex education teaching resources for primary school children.  ""The state simply cannot safeguard children in the same way that parents can. This proposal is sending a huge message to parents that they are unfit to teach their own children about sex.""  Russell Hobby, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""It is so important for young people to be taught about appropriate relationships, and the duties set out today bring that one step closer.""  Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""We do not believe it is necessary for the government to provide standardised frameworks or programmes of study, and we would urge ministers against being too prescriptive,"" he said.  Jonathan Baggaley, chief executive of the PHSE Association said: ""This is a historic step and a clear statement of intent from government.  ""Following years of campaigning we are delighted that Justine Greening has taken this vital step to respond to the clear call from parents, teachers and young people that education must prepare all children, in all schools, for the opportunities and challenges of modern life.""  Ms Greening's announcement follows a widespread campaign by charities, MPs and local authorities, calling for (SRE) to be made a statutory for all schools.  At the end of last year, the chairmen and women of five different Commons select committees called on Ms Greening to make SRE a statutory subject.  SRE is part of the curriculum in Wales, but it is not currently compulsory.  The Welsh government says it expects young people to receive age-appropriate lessons in school, covering ""all aspects of relationships, sexual health and wellbeing issues"".  The subject is not compulsory in Scotland but new guidance was introduced in 2014. Schools and local authorities are responsible for deciding how to put the guidelines into practice.  In Northern Ireland, the Department of Education requires each school to have its own written policy on how it will address the delivery of relationship and sexuality education (RSE).  RSE must be delivered ""in a sensitive manner which is appropriate to the age and understanding of pupils and the ethos of the school""."
759,"Artjon Shkurtaj asked for protection as a whistleblower after losing his job in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in North Korea.  Mr Shkurtaj said he found fake US bills in an office safe and local staff were paid in euros, and not local currency.  The UNDP denied any wrongdoing, and keeping improper accounts.  The agency has been accused by the US administration of handing over cash to the North Korean regime without proper accounting or paperwork, the BBC's Laura Trevelyan said from New York.  The implication is the UN allowed millions of dollars to go to the North Korean government instead of going to programmes to help people in poverty, our correspondent said.  The UN carried out an audit in June and said that while there had been breaches of rules, there had been no systematic diversion of UN money to North Korean authorities.  ""UNDP has invited the individual to submit all relevant information to the UNDP office charged with undertaking internal inquiries, but he has so far declined to do so,"" a spokesman from the agency said.  UN deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said the UN Ethics Office was looking into Mr Shkurtaj's appeal for whistleblower status."

Hamilton only took charge in March, stepping into the hot seat from his role as director of football after Bruce Rioch quit - frustrated at a lack of funds to strengthen the squad. Among the other names believed to have been interested in the job were former Southampton boss Dave Jones and ex-Norwich favourites Steve Bruce and Mel Machin."
761,"AIG: What does this US giant do?  AIG has been saved by billions of dollars from the US government American International Group (AIG) is one of the world's biggest insurance firms, but it has fallen spectacularly from grace in recent months. Although it provides services to millions of people across the world, it recently announced the biggest quarterly loss in corporate history. It has received billions of dollars of US state aid, and is now embroiled in a row with the government over bonuses. AIG boss Ed Liddy is appearing before a Congressional hearing on Wednesday. He will be answering questions about $165m (£119m) of bonuses due to be paid to executives despite the fact that the US taxpayer has effectively saved the company from collapse. AIG provides insurance and financial services in more than 130 countries. The group and its subsidiaries employ more than 100,000 people around the world, including 2,000 in the UK, and it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as stock exchanges in Ireland and Tokyo. It provides a range of insurance services to a variety of commercial, institutional and individual customers. It also provides retirement and asset management services around the world. The insurer has 30 million US policy holders and provides insurance to more than 100,000 companies and other entities. It is known across the world as a major sponsor of the football team Manchester United. However, recent financial troubles mean the insurer will not be renewing its sponsorship agreement with the football club when the deal expires in 2010. The company was founded in 1919 in Shanghai, China by the American businessman Cornelius Vander Starr. In 1949 he moved the company's headquarters to New York where it remains today. The company was listed on the New York stock exchange in 1969, and has grown through acquisitions. In 2005 it became embroiled in a row with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the way the company was operating. In the wake of the controversy, Hank Greenberg - who had been the company's chief executive since 1967 - resigned and was replaced by Martin Sullivan. At the beginning of 2008 it was ranked the 18th biggest company in the world in the Forbes Global 2000 list. In June 2008, after two consecutive quarters of record losses, Martin Sullivan left the company and was succeeded by former Citigroup chief executive Robert Willumstad. Mr Willumstad was awarded a $1m annual salary, and a potential bonus and incentive package worth $21m. But the timing could not have been worse for Mr Willumstad, as the credit crunch soon hit AIG hard. The company soon racked up billions of dollars of losses related to the problems afflicting the housing and credit markets. AIG played a key role in insuring risk for financial institutions around the world. On 16th September 2008, the US Federal Reserve announced an $85bn rescue package for AIG to save it from collapse. Under the two-year agreement, the central bank took a 79.9% stake in the insurer. Mr Willumstad had hoped to stay at the company for several years, but as part of the company's rescue deal he was replaced by the former boss of Allstate Corporation, Edward Liddy. The government was soon forced to put a further $40bn into the company in November to save it from collapse. Under the new deal, the existing $85bn government rescue package was restructured, cutting the $85bn to $60bn. AIG was back in the news earlier this month when it reported losses for the final three months of 2008 of $61.7bn - the largest quarterly loss in corporate history. It then hit the front pages when President Barack Obama expressed outrage at the $165m of bonuses that the insurer had agreed to pay to executives. US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said that the $165m will be deducted from government funds due to be paid to AIG.     "
762,"Many workers have been killed - many more than the official death toll of 14, a Greek union representative said.  But, he told the programme, no official numbers are being kept.  The BBC team observed workers - many from Eastern Europe and South Asia - operating without protective equipment and with minimal supervision.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Face the Facts programme, Greek Olympic Committee President Lampis Nikolaou admitted that the death toll in Athens was far greater than in any other city to have recently hosted the games.  ""The human price is very high for me,"" Mr Nikolaou said.  ""This is something that I regret very much but in every country, in every workplace, accidents happen and people die.""  The BBC team visited some of the 39 new sites still under construction for the Olympics with British health and safety expert Tom Mellish.  With widespread evidence of poor safety standards, no protective clothing, and little or no apparent organisation, such sites would be closed down in the UK, he said.  ""You get down to some of the detail then you get some real howlers for health and safety.""  Mr Mellish said that in his view, the Athens experience raised questions for the International Olympic Committee about which countries were truly suitable to host the games in future.  Tackled by Face the Facts presenter John Waite, the general secretary for the Olympic Games, Spyros Capralos, admitted he had no idea how many workers have died constructing the games.  ""We have accidents in the streets, we have accidents everywhere on a daily basis and we don't talk about this.  ""But we have taken all the necessary measures (so) that we don't have any accidents in the preparation of these Olympic Games.""  ""We have managed to do a lot in a very short period of time and I don't know other statistics for other countries... but I think that we have first-class facilities, well-built and I think that overall the result is a good result.""  Eventually Mr Capralos became so exasperated by the line of questioning that he called the interview to a halt and walked away.  The general secretary of the Greek Construction Workers' Union, George Theodorou, told the programme he had collected names and details of 14 workers who had died on Olympic facilities.  ""Men are being forced to work long shifts, up to 14 hours a day every day, in very hot temperatures and under constant pressure to complete construction work in time for the Olympics,"" he said.  ""Most have no hard hats or safety boots and if they complain, they're sacked. ""  Greek opposition MP Liana Kanelli told the BBC that the problems arose because although Greece had seven years to prepare for the games, more than half of that time was taken up by legal battles.  ""There wasn't a brick laid for the first three-and-a-half years. We've now got about one injury or one death every couple of days.  ""This is a Greek tragedy that we will have to face after the Olympics."""
763,"The Queen Mother has suffered a minor injury after slipping from a chair but still hopes to attend the funeral of her daughter Princess Margaret on Friday.  An ambulance and doctor were called after the incident in the Queen Mother's sitting room at Sandringham on Wednesday afternoon.  She suffered a ""flesh wound"" on the arm and had it dressed with a bandage.  Even before the slip there had been fears that the 101-year-old, who has been suffering from a chest cold since before Christmas and frail health for some time, would be too ill to attend her daughter's funeral.  But Clarence House - the Queen Mother's official London residence - said ""there is no change to Her Majesty's plans to travel to Windsor"" on Thursday. Buckingham Palace has been looking at different transport options for the journey, including a helicopter with a specially built ramp, but it is considered most likely she will travel by car. Shortly before news of the Queen Mother's slip emerged, Tony Blair led the Commons in a tribute to her daughter. Speaking at the weekly prime minister's question time, he declared ""how deeply we express our sadness on the death of her Royal Highness, the Princess Margaret"". Mr Blair went on: ""She will be remembered by the whole nation with huge affection for her love of culture and art, her sense of fun, but most of all for the service she gave our nation"". He expressed condolences to the Royal Family, which were echoed by Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy.  Earlier BBC Royal Correspondent Jennie Bond said the palace had told her that the Queen Mother was gradually improving after being laid low by a bug caught over Christmas, and could now walk around on flat surfaces, with the aid of sticks. She said the Queen Mother was a ""proud and dignified lady"", who would not want to be seen struggling to get in and out of cars under the public gaze. The Queen Mother was nonetheless determined to be at the service, she added. The Queen Mother's last public engagement was on 22 November, when she re-commissioned the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal at a ceremony in Portsmouth. Her daughter Princess Margaret died on Saturday at the age of 71, after a stroke led to heart problems. The princess's body will be cremated at Slough crematorium, following the service. According to her wishes, no members of the royal family or friends will attend the cremation.  Her ashes will be placed in a casket beside the coffin of her father, King George VI, in the Royal Vault of the chapel. On Tuesday her former lady-in-waiting Lady Glenconner said Margaret had wanted to be cremated, because she found the royal burial ground, in Windsor Great Park, ""very gloomy"". Princess Margaret's coffin is currently resting in the Queen's Chapel at St James's Palace in London."
764,"Scotland's key tourist attractions enjoyed a boost in visitor numbers last year, according to industry leaders.  The Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions (ASVA), which compiled the data, said visits to 260 of its member sites rose for the second year.  Edinburgh Castle came out top on the list - which included both free and paid-for sights - with more than 1.5m visitors, a rise of 5.9%.  But numbers at the city's zoo saw the biggest fall, dropping by 5.7%.  Although Edinburgh Zoo was the second most popular paid-for attraction, visitors were down from 671,941 in 2014 to 633,500 in 2015.  The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art saw the biggest rise in footfall, going up 40.6% from 320,605 visitors in 2014 to 457,655 in 2015.  The organisation's annual ""Visitor Trends Report"" found that more than 27 million visits were made to their sites in Scotland in 2015, a rise of 3.4% on 2014 figures.  The increase came on top of a 6% rise in 2014, suggesting that visitor attractions in Scotland are currently enjoying a period of sustained growth.  Sectors which fared particularly well in 2015 included gardens (+7.5%), museums and galleries (+2.7%), castles and heritage sites (+5.1%), and boat trips/marine-related attractions (+11.9%).  The National Museum of Scotland, which had ten galleries closed for refurbishment, had a 4.4% reduction, from 1,639,574 visitors in 2014 to 1,567,31 last year.  Douglas Walker, Chair of ASVA said: ""After a number of challenging years for the sector, it is clear that visitor attractions are entering what we hope will be a period of sustained growth.  ""The attractions which have done particularly well in 2015 are those that have invested in their visitor offer by developing innovative new products and services, as well as launching creative events and exhibitions programmes, all of which are vital for keeping visitors coming back time and again."""

766,"Britain hasn't always been obsessed by skinny decaf lattés - back in the 1950s it was all about tea. Our tea consumption then was 50 times that of coffee and while coffee bars did exist they were more of a refuge for artists and writers than a grab and go style accessory.  As recently as the 1980s, if you asked a Briton what sort of coffee they drank, it was invariably an instant variety.  About the closest Britain came to excitement in the coffee stakes was the advertising for the most high-profile brands of the day, such as Gold Blend and the ""will they, won't they"" storylines dreamed up for the suave, sophisticated couple pictured in the adverts.  Two Americans, Scott and Ali Svenson, came to the UK in 1990 from Seattle. Well used to a day-time diet of Starbucks coffee, their first experience of a British cafe was a disaster - all weak and watery, presented in a tasteful styrofoam cup. So was born the beginning of an empire, the Seattle Coffee Company and then Starbucks' UK invasion.  Seattle multiplied but, as it grew, others followed suit, and its 49 outlets were soon swallowed up by Starbucks, which went on to open an average of more than five stores every month in the UK from 1996 to 2000.  Prices paid for the prized high street locations spiralled until Starbucks forked out an eye-watering £1.5m in a Leicester Square rental deal.  As the competition struggled to compete, Starbucks kept running its expensive sites at a loss, prompting accusations that they were using their muscle to unfairly squeeze out the opposition.  Starbucks didn't just upset its rivals. Its drive for world dominance meant it was becoming a symbol of globalisation, and therefore a target for protestors.  Meanwhile, in 2002 Coffee Republic lost £7.5m. Caffe Nero struggled on under a debt mountain of £7m while casting around for possible takeover targets to gain a bigger share of the market.  Nowhere is the cappuccino conflict between cafe operators more obvious than in London, where some streets will have all four of the big players based within a stone's throw of each other.  Massimo Bergamen, area manager for the Costa group, is opening a new flagship store on the Strand in the heart of London's West End. But next door is Caffe Nero and Coffee Republic is on the other side of the road. It's a cut-throat business.  And is any of the coffee any good? Louis Salvone, coffee connoisseur and spokesman for the Real Coffee Society says quality varies a great deal. He sampled a Coffee Republic offering, specially for the Money Programme: ""Presentation good, still only tasting milk, still milk, now I'm getting the coffee hit ... well, the best espresso I had today was Costa's but the best cappuccino was probably Coffee Republic's, so there you go.""  It's not a resounding judgement. But, whoever wins the business battle, we've all fallen for the charms of the latté and the cappuccino - and coffee bars are now part of the British way of life.  First in a three part series looking at the war between high street stores. This first programme looks at the many coffee shops now fighting for our attention.  This programme was first transmitted on Wednesday 12 February 2003."
767,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

769,"Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has been confronted by angry residents in an area badly hit by flooding.  Farmers and MPs in the Somerset Levels have accused the government and the Environment Agency of failing to take action by dredging the rivers.  The agency has said increased dredging would not have prevented recent flooding.  Mr Paterson promised an action plan would be drawn up to provide a long-term solution.  The Environment Agency currently has 14 flood warnings in place, 10 of which are in south-west England, where more rain is forecast over the coming days.  An agency spokesman said: ""We're doing everything we can to pump water off the Somerset Levels as quickly as river and tide levels allow.  When Owen Paterson arrived, a chorus of shouts from angry, placard-waving residents rose just above the roar of the billions of gallons of water being pumped off the levels into the River Parrett, here near Moorland. They want government action and they wanted to show the environment secretary just how mad they are. After nearly a month underwater, many had lost money, all had lost patience. They seemed pleased he had come to see the vast waterscape for himself, but disappointed he hadn't brought his cheque book with him and only seemed focused on a long-term plan rather than dishing out any extra cash today. One woman who had reached the end of her tether told me her life had been ruined by the floods. Fighting back the tears, she said it was all too little too late.  ""We have brought in extra manpower and pumping equipment from around the country and have 65 pumps working around the clock. This is the single largest pumping operation ever undertaken in Somerset.""  But he added: ""Dredging is often not the best long term or economic solution and increased dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels would not have prevented the recent widespread flooding.""  As Mr Paterson visited the Somerset Levels - a wetland, which is one of the lowest and flattest areas of the country - local farmer Becky Riley said more should have been done sooner.  She asked: ""Why was this not done last year, when this happened last year? Why have we just had the pumps put in now, why?""  Mr Paterson said he wanted to see a ""concrete plan"" from ""all the interested parties"" - including the local authorities, the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Transport, the internal drainage boards and the Department for Communities and Local Government - to provide a long-term solution, submitted to him within the next six weeks.  The minister added the plan would ""almost certainly"" involve clearing the Parrett and Tone rivers, acknowledging that national guidelines on dredging did not apply in the area as so much of it is below sea level.  Mr Paterson said: ""I've come down here to see what can be done. It appears from what everyone's telling me that we do need to dredge these two rivers but also we need to do more to hold water back, way back in the hills.""  He said he understood the impact of flooding on the community, adding: ""It is absolutely shocking and horrifying to people's private lives, to their business lives, it is incredibly disruptive.""  Ian Liddell-Grainger, Tory MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset, said of the River Parrett: ""Once it's dredged we can then maintain it but the Environment Agency has to stop this mucking around and get on with it.""  He dismissed as ""pathetic"" the Environment Agency's claims that the rain would have overwhelmed the river system even if it had dredged the waterways.  ""It is an absolutely ridiculous excuse,"" he said. ""This never flooded to this level ever in living memory, and we've got people who have been here for a long time. If you look back into the mists of time you don't have this.""  It comes as the National Famers Union in the South West said the floods had left farmers in a state of ""utter despair"". and the Environment Agency said about 40 properties in the Somerset Levels had flooded.  Prime Minister David Cameron said he thought the Environment Agency had done ""excellent work"" helping communities deal with flooding.  But he added that it had to listen - and address - concerns over flooding.  BBC weather forecaster Susan Powell said frequent showers from 21:00 GMT through to midnight on Tuesday could bring up to 25mm (1in) of rain in parts of southern England, with a risk of up to 40mm (1.5in) of rain on higher ground in south-west England.  The Environment Agency said there was also ""a risk of groundwater flooding in Hampshire until Wednesday"" and that ""parts of Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, West Berkshire and Surrey may also experience localised groundwater flooding over the next five days"".  And the Met Office is warning that persistent rain will fall on to already saturated ground in northern and eastern areas of Scotland creating a risk of localised flooding.  Flood warnings in England are in place for parts of the Midlands, North East, South East and South West. are also more than 140 flood alerts - indicating flooding is possible - in places across England and Wales.  Parts of northern England and Scotland have seen snow, but so far there has been little travel disruption in the majority of the UK, although ferry crossings between Weymouth and the Channel Islands were cancelled due to adverse weather.  One sporting event hit by the weather was the racing at Plumpton, east Sussex, which was abandoned on Monday due to a waterlogged course."
770,"Jacob Zuma's advisers say he has nothing to hide South Africa's opposition leader has called for an investigation into whether President Jacob Zuma has broken the government's strict ethics code. This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "
771,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
772,"Oxford Street in April 1941 after a heavy bombing raid by the Luftwaffe    The West End of London is the capital's beating heart, world famous for the symbols of British government, royal palaces, high-end shopping and pulsating entertainment. Seventy years ago these London streets, part of the City of Westminster, faced a profound crisis. In September 1940, the normal pulse of life across the West End was replaced by the wail of sirens, searchlights and the nightly visits of hundreds of German bombers raining death upon London's inhabitants. Although the capital's East End was the most heavily bombed in the Second World War - an estimated 80-90% of all Luftwaffe bombs fell here - the West End was also ravaged, badly. The London boroughs of City of Westminster and St Marylebone - 8.3 square miles of central London stretching from the north bank of the Thames up to Paddington and St John's Wood - were to suffer considerable bombing during the ensuing London Blitz of 7 September 1940 - 11 May 1941 and in later attacks during 1944 -1945. Oxford Street yesterday, from Oxford Circus up to Marble Arch, completely empty of traffic, and only a few pedestrians, with the late afternoon sun shining straight down the empty roadway and glittering on innumerable fragments of broken glass.    Iconic locations in the West End, including Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, Oxford and Regent Streets, Piccadilly and the up-market Café de Paris nightclub on Coventry Street were badly damaged or destroyed. The price paid by Londoners in the Blitz was heavy. Across London during 1940-1945 nearly 30,000 people were killed and over 50,000 injured. Over one million buildings were destroyed or otherwise damaged. Wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill would later describe London's resilience and the courageous response of its inhabitants to the Blitz as a pivotal moment in Britain's national survival. On Oxford Street, home since the mid-19th century to the West End's showcase retail emporia, the Blitz arrived with shocking effect in September 1940. Oxford Street's personal nemesis came during the night and early hours of 17-18 September 1940. The work of generations of retailers and architects disappeared overnight as 268 Heinkel 111 and Dornier Do 17 bombers dropped their ordinance on London. Oxford Street was hit repeatedly, from Tottenham Court Road to Marble Arch. That night, fires along the street raged out of control for several hours, acting as a reference point for new waves of Luftwaffe bombers. When dawn broke, on 18 September, no fewer than four of the West End's most prestigious department stores were ablaze, had been badly damaged or destroyed. They were household names: John Lewis, Selfridges, Bourne & Hollingsworth and Peter Robinson. In 2010, two of these retailers continue to trade robustly, two are consigned to history. Of the four buildings attacked, three survive; two are new businesses inhabiting older, grander facades. All carry the marks of September 1940. At the eastern end of Oxford Street and at Oxford Circus two longstanding Oxford Street retail names were hit during the raid of 17-18 September 1940: Bourne & Hollingsworth (today's Plaza Shopping Centre at No 120) and Peter Robinson (today's Niketown at No 200-236). Bourne & Hollingsworth - an imposing edifice built in 1894 and remodelled in art deco style in 1928 - was hit in the night raid of 17 September by high explosive bombs which gouged a huge hole in the store's interior and severely damaged several shop floors. Shards of glass carpeted its Oxford Street locale and adjoining Berners Street. But the next day, in a powerful example of the 'Blitz spirit', the staff were back at work, unfurling large Union Flags to cover bomb damage to the store front. A week later, part of the eastern wing of the store was reopened for business. Today, the former Bourne & Hollingsworth still impresses. Although the site is occupied by the modern Plaza shopping centre and adorned by a bronze ballerina statue, much of the art deco department store's upper stories survive, the letters 'BH' in 1920s' script still proclaiming the building's heritage proudly. Also hit that night was the 1924 Peter Robinson's department store on Oxford Circus (200-236 Oxford Street). The upper right section of the store's neo-classical façade was ripped open; three floors were destroyed; plate glass windows and debris was blown into Oxford Circus. Parts of Peter Robinson's were reopened four days later, but its Oxford Circus storefront was boarded up and subsequently used to display war advertising hoardings. Later in the war, the store's basement menswear department was converted by the BBC into broadcast studios for its Eastern Service. The writer George Orwell made several wartime radio broadcasts at No 200 for the BBC's Indian Section during 1941-1943. West of Oxford Circus, John Lewis's - at 278 Oxford Street on the corner with Holles Street - was next in the bomb-aimers' sights, suffering catastrophic fire damage. The store was hit by several incendiary and high explosive bombs in the early hours of 18 September. Two hundred people were sleeping in the store's basement air raid shelter. The store's attractive West House, completed in 1897 and facing Oxford Street, was hit by a German oil bomb (flammenbombe), showering the building with a mixture of burning oil and petrol. Fire rapidly took hold and was spread by the wind across Holles Street to destroy most of the store's East House (a 1928 tunnel-linked extension today occupied by British Home Stores, Royal Bank of Scotland, the London College of Fashion and the Carphone Warehouse). No casualties were reported among the staff or in the basement shelter but three firemen arriving at the scene were killed by an additional falling bomb. The western end of Oxford Street was sealed off: thirty fire engines tackled the blaze; crews struggled until 20 September to bring the flames under control. City of Westminster Civil Defence records, including original pencil messages written by volunteer ARP wardens and support staff, reveal that fire broke out again on 25 September. By then, John Lewis's was almost entirely burnt out, the building reduced to a fire-scorched shell. In the following days, George Orwell walked past the smouldering John Lewis bomb site and noted the disconcerting sight of shop window mannequins piled up outside. To him they looked alarmingly like corpses. Fellow wartime journalist Kingsley Martin later described the remnants of John Lewis's as ""like the ruins of a Greek temple"". Staff salvaged what was left from the rubble; the store struggled back to its feet. A small tin was found containing the staff's tea money - welded to the metal base by the heat of the fire. Three weeks later, part of John Lewis's East House was reopened for business. In October 1940, the store's General Manager noted in a letter that although 'all woodwork and everything else inflammable has been destroyed completelywe shall be able to deal in the regular way with all orders by post addressed to us at Oxford Street. The staff of our Furnishing Departments will wait upon customers in their own homes up to thirty miles from London and at greater distances if the order is substantial"". As noted by the Daily Mail, John Lewis's accounts department was also unaffected and was issuing its monthly invoices as normal. Repair teams were kept busy at John Lewis's until 23 November 1940. As the war progressed, John Lewis continued to do its bit for the war effort, hosting a series of popular public exhibitions in its basement air raid shelter. But the building was now beyond repair. John Lewis's - a presence on Oxford Street since 1864 - remained a bomb site until 1954. Staff at John Lewis get back to work after a bombing raid in 1940 The store was completely rebuilt by architects Slater & Uren during 1958-1960. The rebuilt store is celebrating its 50th anniversary in October 2010. The night raiders' work was not over. Further west, Selfridges department store on Oxford Street was also struck early on 18 September. As John Lewis's burned, Selfridges was hit by a single high explosive bomb and by several incendiaries. The store's elegant roof gardens - famous in the 1920s and 1930s as a place for strolling after shopping - were badly damaged. They were never to open again. Broken glass from Selfridges' many upper storey windows fell into surrounding streets. Owner H. Gordon Selfridge's own prized signature window - autographed by dozens of celebrity visitors to the store since its opening in 1909 - was shattered. The sight reportedly reduced the 84-year-old American retail magnate to tears. The store's impressive art deco lifts, installed in 1928, suffered extensive damage and would not carry shoppers again until 1945. After the raid, the ground floor windows - normally used for Selfridges' world famous shop front displays - were bricked up for the war's duration. Selfridges had survived, but with deep internal wounds. St Marylebone Civil Defence records detail further incendiary bomb damage inflicted in a night raid of 17 April, 1941. In this attack, fire destroyed the store's beautiful Palm Court Restaurant, venue for the rich and famous. Despite the damage of 1940-41, Selfridges was keen to show its continuing commitment to Allied victory. The store hosted Utility fashion shows and mounted exhibitions and window displays with wartime themes. It was also to play a more important role as the war progressed. One of Selfridges' sub-basements was converted to hold a secret Bell Telephone 'X-System' communications system. Codenamed 'Sigsaly', and operated by US Army technicians, specialist cryptographic signal equipment scrambled top-secret phone calls between Britain and her Allies. From 1943, this system - linked from Selfridges to the Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall - provided Prime Minster Winston Churchill with a secure phone link to his US counterpart, President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Selfridges' war was not over. At 11pm, 6 December 1944, a V2 rocket hit the Red Lion pub in Duke Street, just off Oxford Street and yards from Selfridges. A canteen situated in the Selfridges Annex building - bordering Somerset, Wigmore and Orchard streets and nicknamed the SWOD - was badly damaged. Eight American servicemen were killed with 32 injured. Ten British civilians were also killed and seven injured. Selfridges' shop-front Christmas tree displays were scattered into the street. Although the Food Hall was undamaged, other departments had to be cleaned throughout. Flooding also threatened operation of the Sigsaly system. In a memo to staff, H. Gordon Selfridge praised their swift response and their courage. The next day, 7 December 1944, Selfridges was again open for business. Seventy years on Oxford Street retains its usual frenetic pace and reputation as one of the West End's major retail arteries. But the memories of 17-18 September 1940 lie just under the surface of today's bustle. The devastation of four of Oxford Street's world famous department stores during just a few hours in September 1940 still bears powerful witness to one of the toughest yet ultimately proudest periods of London's rich and turbulent history.

773,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
774,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

777,"Jacob Zuma's advisers say he has nothing to hide South Africa's opposition leader has called for an investigation into whether President Jacob Zuma has broken the government's strict ethics code. This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "

782,"   Engels lived a double life in Manchester. By day he worked for his father’s firm of ‘capitalist exploiters’, while at night he became a social investigator. He met with other industrialists and businessmen and followed the lifestyle of his bourgeois station. Meanwhile he devoted his spare time to exploring the political scene and the lives of the Manchester working class.     He wrote for several socialist and radical papers during this period, both in England and continental Europe, on a variety of issues. For Robert Owen’s ‘The New Moral World’ and the Chartist papers, the ‘Northern Star’ and ’Democratic Review’, he wrote on the campaigns of the day such as the ten hours bill and others that were attempting to improve peoples working conditions. He highlighted the lessons that could be learnt from them. He also described the characteristics of socialism and other political developments on the continent. For the continental papers he wrote about the economic developments and the lessons that could be learnt from the class struggle taking place in England.     Soon after his arrival in Manchester he began a relationship with a young woman, named Mary Burns. She was to become his partner until her death twenty years later. It is not certain where they met, although it is widely believed that she was a probably an employee at the Engel’s and Ermine mill. It was Mary who introduced and guided him through the dwellings of the Manchester working class.     Words: Danny Crosby                  "

784,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
785,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
786,"Cardinal Emmanuel Delly made the request in his Christmas message.  Mr Aziz, who is himself a Christian, gave himself up to US forces after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 but no charges have been brought against him.  He was seen in court last year in his pyjamas, testifying for the defence in the trial of Saddam Hussein.  ""In terms of Tariq Aziz,"" Cardinal Delly said, ""we have to demand the release of all those who were captured and which have no evidence against them.""  The Chaldean patriarch of Baghdad, who criticised the US-led invasion in 2003, said his requests to visit Mr Aziz in prison had been turned down.  Iraqi prosecutors say he could face charges in connection with the crushing of the Shia Muslim uprising after the 1991 Gulf War.  In January last year, Mr Aziz's lawyer said his client had suffered a stroke.  In his message, Cardinal Delly also called for religious freedom in Iraq, where many Christians have been kidnapped, killed or forced to flee."

The Coffin Works were constructed in 1892 to the design of Richard Harley for Newman Brothers who were brass founders and manufactured metal coffin fittings in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter in the C19. The company was founded by Alfred Newman and his three sons: Horace, George and John. Newman Bros. Made coffin furniture in solid brass, electro-brass, silver plate and nickel plate, and later from resins with oxy-silver, oxy-bronze and oxy-copper finishes. The company also made shrouds. In the 1950s the company was exporting widely to such countries as West Africa, India, Ceylon, South Africa, West Indies, Canada and Malta. The family firm, which had been operating for over 100 years, was forced out of business due to the mass production of cheap fittings made from resins and plastics. At the time of its closure (1999) Newman Bros was one of only three remaining coffin furniture manufactures in England. A campaign to save some of Britain's most historic buildings from collapse is being launched as part of a ten part series on BBC 2 in August. The ""Restoration"" programme will feature thirty buildings at risk of decay and neglect, including Birmingham's Coffin Factory in the Jewellery Quarter. They'll all be competing to win the ultimate prize - rescue from ruin! Newman Brothers Coffin Factory     A fascinating bit of history dating back to 1882 has been unearthed amidst the bustle of twenty first century Birmingham. At Newman Brothers they once employed one hundred people making traditional features for coffins. Rest in Peace?     The company was reknowned all over the world until it closed in 1999. At the time of its closure, it was one of only three remaining coffin furniture manufacturers in England. But despite that it's not yet 'Rest in Peace' for the factory, there are plans to turn it into a museum. In the Press Shop many of the machines used to make brass plates remain untouched while upstairs many of the shrouds are still on display. Grave secrets     But it's not just a case of preserving the past, part of the building is also planned to be converted into workshops for today's small businesses. So it seems the Newman Brothers factory isn't quite ready to take its secrets to the grave...... Newman Bros Coffin Factory will be featured on BBC2 on August 26 at 9pm in a three-way Midlands battle with Cromford Mill in Derbyshire and Bethesda Chapel in Stoke-on-Trent.

791,"A new weekly midweek ""official chart update"" is set to launch on BBC Radio 1.  The half-hour show beginning on 10 March will air every Wednesday between 3.30-4pm in the run-up to the traditional Sunday chart countdown.  Up until now official midweek chart numbers have been issued to workers in the industry but not broadcast in this format.  Martin Talbot, managing director of the Official Charts Company, said: ""The launch of this official chart update will mean that, for the first time, music fans will get a reliable insight into how the race for number one is shaping up.""  The update will be based on the ""sales flashes"" which are already circulated by the Official Charts Company to the music industry on Wednesday mornings.  98% of singles are now downloaded. There have been close chart races in recent weeks between the likes of Rage Against The Machine and Joe McElderry for the Christmas number one.  Greg James will be hosting the new weekly show. He said: ""I want to shine a light on all the songs going in and dropping out of the charts.  ""Why are people buying a specific record? Why aren't they buying that one? Reasons like that.""  Artists have been having their say on the news.  Rapper Tinie Tempah, promoting his single Pass Out, has mixed feelings.  ""I always used to look forward to the Sunday chart and then I found that when I got into the music industry we had the opportunity to see midweeks - at first I didn't really like it,"" he said.  ""So for me personally it was ruining the suspense of watching for a whole week.  ""I guess there are two sides to it, when people go and buy music, as well as liking the song, they're also supporting the artists and buying into the artist.  Dizzee Rascal, who enjoyed three number one singles in 2009, said: ""It might be good for people to know who's there and make people more excited I guess. It might kill the anticipation a bit or it might add to it - we'll see.""  London electro-poppers Hot Chip, who release their fourth album One Life Stand today (1 February), added: ""It's not something I get too involved with really, the chart positions.  ""I definitely used to like it as a kid, I used to listen to the radio every Sunday and listen to the countdown and watch Top Of The Pops on a Thursday.  ""It'd be nice to have that excitement back again. Maybe something like this could help with that.  ""I guess what music fans have demanded is free music.""  The official charts company will also publish the official midweek chart updates on single and album sales on Radio 1's website, Facebook and Twitter.  Read now - Glastonbury line-up 'nearly done'"

796,"The NHS's drugs watchdog has released guidance which says Velcade's cost-effectiveness has not been proven and more research is needed.  Patients and health charities have condemned the ruling by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.  Velcade slows the advance of myeloma - cancer of bone marrow plasma cells.  An announcement from NICE had not been expected until Tuesday, but it was brought forward after the ruling was apparently leaked to the press.  Andrea Sutcliffe, who led the drug appraisal, said she was concerned at ""misleading coverage"" in some national newspapers.  ""It is one thing to criticise our decision not to recommend the use of this drug, but quite another to unfairly raise patient expectations about the effect of this drug and its availability in other parts of the UK,"" she added.  Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with myeloma in the UK each year.  The charity, Myeloma UK, said no patient in the UK should die without having access to the drug.  A trial last year showed Velcade (bortezomib) could extend the life expectancy of a patient by an average of six months more than standard treatment. Treatment costs about £18,000 per patient.  The drug was approved for use in Scotland in 2004, where it is mainly used as a last resort.  The Daily Mail earlier reported that it had seen a leaked ruling, which said the drug was more clinically effective than chemotherapy but was not regarded as ""cost effective"".  Jacky Pickles, 44, one of three women with bone marrow cancer from Keighley in West Yorkshire, is campaigning to get the drug approved.  ""If NICE is going to get away with not backing these drugs, then we will be stuck in the dark ages.  ""Isn't three years of my life worth anything?""  Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said the NHS had become a ""Scottish and a separate English health service"".  NICE, which regulates primary care trusts in England and Wales, has come under repeated fire over its decisions not to fund drugs.  The guidance will be formally issued before the end of the year.  Objectors however can appeal against their decision.  Ms Sutcliffe, who led the appraisal for NICE, said the committee had considered comments received during consultation on an earlier draft and had not changed its conclusion.  ""Although the drug is clinically effective compared with high dose dexamethasone, its cost-effectiveness has not been satisfactorily demonstrated and therefore further research is required.""  A NICE spokesman added: ""NICE has appraised 26 cancer treatments to date, and we have recommended 25 of them for use by the NHS.""  A spokeswoman for Myeloma UK said the charity was taking legal advice over the ruling.  ""This represents probably the single biggest setback in the history of the treatment of myeloma.""  She said the entire myeloma community, including Myeloma UK and the other charities involved in the appraisal, were devastated.  ""Velcade is a proven and licensed treatment and, quite simply, no myeloma patient in the UK should die without having access to it."""

798,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. You might not think you know much about Malawian music, but chances are you have heard it, or at least musicians influenced by it. African music in general first came to international attention in the 1950s with the popularity of ""kwela"" in the urban townships of Johannesburg. Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other    South Africa claims kwela for its own, but Kenny Gilmore, the director of a documentary that charts the history of Malawian music, says kwela was actually popularised in South Africa by Malawian musicians. ""The founding fathers of kwela kwela, a lot, not all of them, were Malawian, Malawi's never been that famous so nobody hears about them,"" he told the BBC World Service. ""Then they take a holiday down to South Africa, play some music, then, boom, the kwela kwela revolution [happens] and everybody thinks its South African."" Even a capella made famous by groups like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and more contemporary styles like Afro-jazz, both owe much of their distinct style to Malawian musicians according to Mr Gilmore. Malawi has nine tribal and linguistic groups, each possessing its own traditional dances and indigenous rhythms. ""True African music all comes from a traditional dance somewhere... and Malawi has got unique dances with unique rhythms,"" he says. He cites dances such as the Chewa's masked ""Gule Wamkulu"" (the big dance); the Ngoni's ""Ingoma"" war dance; the Beni military dance; and the healing ""Vimbuza"" spirit dance of the Tumbuka. But sadly only a handful of these were recorded in the 1940s and 1950s. Inspired by the late musical archivist Alan Lomax's famous journey to collect early blues recordings in the deep American South, for six weeks last year Mr Gilmore and his team travelled to villages across Malawi hoping to document and record some of this musical heritage, both past and present. He hoped to record as much as possible of what is left of these traditions before the memories and the music are gone forever. ""Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other. I went to Cape Town record shops, nothing, London, nothing, America, New York, nothing. These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms... we've got a unique musical melting pot    ""I'm on a mission to change it, I think the world needs to hear music and Malawi in the same sentence."" Using a portable studio, musicians from Malawi's most rural and remote areas were given the opportunity to record, promote and preserve their musical heritage. What the team got was a mix of individual musicians, small groups and cultural dance troupes, some of it purely traditional, some of it more of a fusion of traditional with contemporary and jazz influences. ""Sometimes you get these places in the world when you get these really interesting melting pots of cultures,"" says Mr Gilmore. ""You have the Congolese influence just above Malawi, you've got the Zambian influence to the west, you've got Zimbabwe to the east and you've got South Africa to the south. ""These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms - so all these great influences come into Malawi, mixing - we've got a unique musical melting pot."" Well-known Malawian musician and politician Lucius Banda says what makes Malawi music so special and deserving of greater interest is the way it has absorbed other influences into its musical traditions, making them their own. ""Malawi music is different, the special thing about Malawi music is [that it is] so cultural,"" he says. ""South Africa has disco and other Western influences. But Malawian music is quite unique in its own perspective."" One such influence which dramatically influenced the country's musical style was the banjo. The banjo was brought back to Malawi by soldiers who had served in East and Western African battalions during WWII. The banjo and blue grass influences were infused with traditional beats and dominated the country's music for nearly 20 years. In the 1970s jazz made an appearance in Malawi, then in more recent times has come gospel, reggae and pop influences. But what is most special about Malawi music according to Mr Gilmore is not the way it has fused the traditional with the contemporary - it is its energy and passion. ""I've played round the world and most of the times you get the beginning and it's warming up, people not getting too excited, then there's a kind of warm phase. ""In Malawi, from the first song boom, the whole club just kind of ignites in a fire bomb and it carries on until the last. ""The bartenders have left the bar, security have left the gate, someone's climbed over the fence you can see the whole nearby village dancing next to the gate, ""It's just a massive riotous party and it just leaves me filled with so much happiness.""

799,"Mr Van Rompuy was widely tipped, but Baroness Ashton was not EU leaders have chosen the Belgian Prime Minister, Herman van Rompuy, to be the first permanent European Council President. The other top job created by the Lisbon Treaty - foreign affairs supremo - has gone to the EU Trade Commissioner, Baroness Catherine Ashton from the UK. Both are seen as consensual politicians with limited foreign policy experience. Both had unanimous backing from the 27 EU leaders at the summit in Brussels, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Earlier, the UK government had said it was no longer pushing for former PM Tony Blair to get the presidency post. Mr Van Rompuy, 62, had crucial French and German support. He has a reputation as a coalition builder, having taken charge of the linguistically divided Belgian government and steered it out of a crisis. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations,"" he told a news conference after his appointment. ""Even if unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth,"" he said, stressing the individuality of EU member states. Baroness Ashton, 53, said she felt ""deeply privileged"" to get the foreign affairs post. ""I was the first woman British commissioner, the first woman trade commissioner, so I am also proud to be the first woman High Representative,"" she said. ""I think there was a strong push to have at least one woman in a senior position,"" she told the BBC later, adding that she hoped Europe would become ""an economic superpower"". US President Barack Obama said the appointments would ""strengthen the EU and enable it to be an even stronger partner to the United States"". ""The United States has no stronger partner than Europe in advancing security and prosperity around the world,"" the White House said in a statement. Earlier, a UK government spokesman revealed the dramatic twist in the British position. Against all expectations this deal was done in a matter of hours, the pre-summit deadlock broken by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His decision to abandon Tony Blair's bid for the new post of President of the European Council meant the field was left clear for the Belgian prime minister, Herman van Rompuy. It also meant that he could bag for a Briton the second job of the night - one arguably more important and probably higher-profile - that of High Representative, something close to a foreign minister for Europe. Neither Mr Van Rompuy nor Baroness Ashton are what might be called big-hitters. Their selection indicates a preference for a low-key start to these new jobs.    The UK persuaded the other six leaders in the socialist group to back Baroness Ashton, having dropped Tony Blair. EU leaders met in Brussels especially to select their first full-time president and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs - new posts created by the Lisbon Treaty, which will come into force on 1 December. The idea under Lisbon is to give the EU more coherence and continuity in key policy areas. Up until now the presidency has been held by member states in turn, on a six-month rotation. Going into the meeting the leaders had various candidates to choose from. There were fears that the negotiations would go on late into the night, but it quickly emerged that a deal had been struck. Mr Brown praised Mr Van Rompuy as ""a consensus builder"" who had ""brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty"". Turning to Baroness Ashton's appointment, he said ""it gives Britain a powerful voice within the Council and the [EU] Commission. He is camera-shy, a man who some refer to as the ""grey mouse""    ""It will ensure that Britain's voice is very loud and clear. It will ensure that Britain remains at the heart of Europe."" Baroness Ashton ""is the first woman to hold such a high position in the EU,"" he added. Commenting on the choice, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: ""It's so important that Britain remains at the heart of the European project."" The foreign policy chief will have a seat as vice-president of the European Commission, as well as a budget worth billions of euros and a new diplomatic service of up to 5,000 people. For months Mr Blair had been a favourite for president, backed by the UK government, and he was the highest-profile candidate. Another contender, Dutch PM Jan-Peter Balkenende, ruled himself out of the contest as the meeting got under way. The EU leaders had a working dinner together to negotiate the appointments. Drives forward the work of EU Council of Ministers Represents the EU on the world stage They were reported to be striving for a balance in the two posts, with one filled by a candidate from one of the bigger EU states, the other from a smaller country. Similarly, the presidency was expected to go to a centre-right politician and the post of foreign affairs chief to the centre-left. The combination of Mr Van Rompuy and Baroness Ashton achieves that balance, the BBC's Jonny Dymond says. Mr Barroso said Mr Van Rompuy's appointment was ""a tribute to Belgium"", noting Belgium's key role as host of the EU's main institutions. The EU president will chair regular meetings of the European Council at which decisions are taken about the political position of the bloc. However, correspondents say the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, as the post is officially known, could have an even more powerful role.

800,"A Dutch court has fined the owner of the Netherlands' biggest cannabis-selling coffee shop 10m euros (£9m, $13.3m) for breaking drugs laws.  Owner Meddie Willemsen, who was tried along with 15 staff of the Checkpoint coffee shop in Terneuzen, was also sentenced to a 16-week prison term.  He was convicted for keeping more than the maximum tolerated amount of 500g (18oz) of drugs at the cafe.  Checkpoint served up to 3,000 people a day before being closed last year.  On a couple of occasions, police found 200kg (440lb) of cannabis when they raided the coffee house.  Willemsen was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, but was released as he had already spent the time in jail ahead of the trial.  He and his staff were convicted of breaking drugs laws, exporting drugs and membership of a criminal organisation.  The 10m euro fine was lower than the 28m euro fine prosecutors had asked for because of the ""role of the authorities"" in allowing Checkpoint to grow unchecked.  ""Checkpoint could not have expanded as much as it did without collaboration from the municipality of Terneuzen,"" a court statement said.  The town, close to the Belgian border, put up road signs showing the way to the Checkpoint and built a car park near it to reduce traffic congestion in town.  Though technically illegal, the Netherlands decriminalised the consumption and possession of under 5g (0.18oz) of cannabis in 1976 under an official ""tolerance"" policy."
801,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

804,"By BBC News Online's Jo Kettlewell On a clear midsummer night in AD 1178, five men gazing at the sky witnessed something astonishing; a mystery which remains unsolved. Stunned, they watched as the Moon began to spew out fire and sparks, and writhe as if in pain. Several times it did this, before taking on a blackish appearance. The events of that night are recorded in the medieval chronicles of Gervase of Canterbury, and they have puzzled historians and scientists alike for most of a millennium. What could possibly explain this deeply strange phenomenon?    The body of the Moon, which was below writhed... throbbed like a wounded snake    The most widely accepted theory is that the five men witnessed a huge meteoroid hitting the surface of the Moon; an impact so big it could have wiped out civilisation, had it occurred on our planet. It is said that this impact could have created the 22-kilometre- (14-mile-) diameter lunar crater Giordano Bruno. But, according to a US researcher, this theory does not quite add up. Paul Withers, a graduate student at the University of Arizona, suggests in this month's issue of Meteoritics and Planetary Science that a collision this big would have resulted in millions of tonnes of moon rock showering down to Earth. There is no record of such a shower ever taking place. It was about an hour after sunset on June 18, AD 1178, that the group of five eyewitnesses saw the upper horn of the bright, new crescent Moon ""suddenly split in two. From the midpoint of this division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out... fire, hot coals and sparks... The body of the Moon, which was below writhed... throbbed like a wounded snake"". A geologist suggested in 1978 that this dramatic passage from the chronicles of Gervase of Canterbury might be an account of the formation of the Giordano Bruno lunar crater. Giordano Bruno is in a position that could be consistent with this description; it is also the youngest crater of its size or larger on the Moon, meaning 1178 could conceivably be its birth date.    An impact this size on the Moon is predicted to happen once every 15 million years or so    Giordano Bruno was made when an asteroid almost three kilometres (two miles) wide slammed into the surface of the Moon. Had it hit Earth, it is likely that none of us would be here today. ""An impact this size on the Moon is predicted to happen once every 15 million years or so,"" Paul Withers told BBC News Online. ""Having one happen in the past 1,000 years would suggest that the predictions might be dangerously incorrect and the Earth might be in more danger from colliding space rocks than is currently thought."" So a sigh of relief should greet Withers' claim that, whatever those men saw that night, it was not the creation of Giordano Bruno. An asteroid impact that size on the Moon would have catapulted 10 million tonnes of debris into the Earth's atmosphere, Withers said, causing an impressive meteor storm. ""I calculate that this would cause a week-long meteor storm comparable to the peak of the 1966 Leonids,"" he said. ""They would be very bright, very easy to see. It would have been a spectacular sight! Everyone around the world would have had the opportunity to see the best fireworks show in history."" But no-one ever reported this firework extravaganza. Historical records show nothing, including the European, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese and Korean astronomical archives. Paul Withers thinks the witnesses might have seen a small meteor that was directly in front of the Moon coming straight towards them through the Earth's atmosphere, as they looked up at the sky that night. Perhaps they did, but we cannot be sure. The events of June 18, 1178, remain a tantalising mystery."
805,"With coal a nationalised industry, and some British mines unprofitable, coal mining was ripe for repositioning - and even privatisation - by Margaret Thatcher's right wing Conservative government of the 1980s. In the early 1980s, the National Union of Miners (NUM) was very strong, with high membership and strong links to the Labour Party. It was also defiantly left wing and militant, with no compunction against threatening industrial action. In 1981, there was the threat of strike when pit closures were mooted, and the government backed down, not feeling its position was strong enough. In 1983, Thatcher appointed Ian MacGregor head of the National Coal Board, which oversaw the industry. He had a reputation for swingeing cutbacks and closures from his previous role at British Steel. The coal industry was ripe for further confrontation between the NUM and the government, and resolutions were passed by various NUM regions to strike if pits were closed for reasons other than geological or resource exhaustion. By the end of 1983, with the Falklands War won and a mandate from that year's general election, Thatcher felt far more secure in her position and was willing to tackle the unions. The struggle over the mining industry would largely come to define her premiership.  In 1984, the announcement came that 20 pits were to close, with 20,000 jobs to go. It was later disclosed that the government, in preparation for the much-anticipated industrial action, had been stockpiling coal to take Britain through the winter. Initial locally-organised strikes across the UK became a national NUM strike in March 1984. But NUM leader Arthur Scargill decreed that NUM regions could decide whether or not to strike on an independent basis. Margaret Thatcher ratcheted up the pressure by referring to striking miners as ""the enemy within"". She continually referred to the action as ""the rule of the mob"". Scargill, in turn, compared the government's techniques in crowd control to those of a ""Latin American state"". The dispute had little chance of ending amicably or quickly. As the strike continued, strains and stresses began to be felt. The workers earned no money and were ineligible for benefits as the strike was deemed illegal; they had to rely on scrimping, saving and handouts. Personal relationships strained and sometimes broke as some decided to work through the strike, becoming 'scabs' in the lexicon of industrial relations. On the picket lines, buses carrying 'scabs' were attacked, and other disturbances took place. Miners clashed with massed ranks of police repeatedly and fiercely all over the country. Some industrial unions supported the miners and some disagreed, to the extent that the government gathered information from them. Observance of the strike within Wales differed from north to south. In the north, only 35% of the 1,000 men employed went on strike, and this had dwindled to 10% by the strike's end in 1985. By contrast, the south Wales coalfield contained the staunchest supporters of industrial action. At the start of the strike, 99.6% of the 21,500 workers joined the action. This reduced to 93% by the end. No other area retained such a level. With so many men not working in an area which was almost single-industry, South Wales suffered hugely with deprivation and community breakdown. Some areas broke down irretrievably, with the effects visible for years afterwards in ghost villages in the Valleys.  One incident in south Wales accelerated the ending the strike and turned some otherwise sympathetic members of the public against the miners. The killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver, was a tragedy and a public relations disaster for the NUM. Wilkie was driving David Williams, a working miner, to the Merthyr Vale mine with a police escort on 30 November 1984. Two striking miners dropped a 21kg concrete block from a bridge onto the car, killing Wilkie instantly. This coincided with a gradual slide in public and media support for the action, amid scandals and accusations. Families found it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves and the NUM funds were running too low to pay for pickets' transport. The official end of the strike came on 3 March 1985, when a vote was passed to return to work even without a new agreement with management. The pits closed rapidly over the next few years, and in 1994 the industry was finally privatised. In 1995 miners famously bought the Tower Colliery in the Cynon Valley, which opened in 1805, to keep it as a going concern. It became Wales' only working coal mine, and the oldest continuously worked deep-coal mine in the UK. That too, is closing due to dwindling coal seams, bringing to an end an industry which once employed almost 200,000 men."

Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
808,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

810,"In 1917 people were astounded by harbours full of colourful ships. But some of the visual impact of Wilkinson’s camouflage is lost today in the black and white images we have of World War One. The striking colours can still be seen on hundreds of model ships in the collection of the Imperial War Museum.  These were made by the Dazzle Section at the Royal Academy of Arts, at Burlington House in London. Scale models were painted and used to test dazzle designs. They were placed on a rotating turntable and viewed through a periscope.  This allowed Wilkinson’s team to see how dazzle distorted a ship’s form as if it were travelling in different directions. Wilkinson believed that using strong contrasts, with light and dark greys, blues and greens, was most effective.  Wilkinson appointed dock officers at ports around Britain. They supervised the painting of ships from the finished designs. One dock officer was the artist Edward Wadsworth. He was a founder of Vorticism - a British art movement that grew out of Cubism.  The Admiralty experimented with various camouflage ideas during WW1. They had considered similar proposals by US artist Abbot H Thayer and the Scottish zoologist John Graham Kerr.  However, it was Wilkinson’s scheme that won them over. After the war the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors awarded him £2000 and recognised him as the creator of dazzle."

813,"The Red Knights group of wealthy supporters mulling a takeover of Manchester United has put plans to make a bid for the club on hold.  The group said media speculation of ""inflated valuation aspirations"" had hampered its plans.  It added that it had always maintained it would only pay a sensible price for Manchester United.  Last week, United reiterated it was not for sale and that the Glazer family owners would not listen to offers.  The Glazer family bought Manchester United for £800m in 2005.  However, critics say the family has saddled the club with massive debts. In the last annual accounts, to July 2009, debts at the club's parent company Red Football Joint Venture increased to £716.5m.  The Red Knights group - which includes the former Football League chairman Keith Harris and Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill - had said that one of its priorities was to reduce debt levels.  The group had been expected to make a bid of about £1bn for United, however reports have suggested that the Glazer family put a much higher value on the club.  Last week, Manchester United said the club was not for sale and that the Glazer family owners would ""not entertain any offers"", adding that the Glazers remained ""fully committed to their long-term ownership of the club"".  In a statement, the Red Knights said that it remained committed to pursuing its efforts ""to try and help bring ownership of Manchester United to its supporters, and under a structure with materially less debt"".  ""As we have maintained however since news of our ambitions first emerged in March, we will only attempt to purchase the club at a sensible price, consistent with the long term interests of the club,"" the group added.  ""Persistent speculation in the media of inflated valuation aspirations has made our goals less attainable, as potential investors have strongly reinforced our views that we should not move forward at a price uneconomic for the future of the club.""  Manchester United fans have launched a campaign to oust the Glazers, with many boycotting the traditional red shirts and scarves and instead wearing green and gold, the original colours of Newton Heath, the amateur side which was founded in 1878 and became Manchester United.  There has also been talk of supporters not renewing season tickets, in an attempt to hit revenue streams at the club.  The Manchester United Supporters Trust, which has backed the Red Knights' campaign, said last month that it had not called for a boycott.  However, it added it was ""encouraging supporters to delay renewal of season tickets and executive facilities until at least the first deadline and ideally until a Red Knight bid comes forward"".  ""If the Glazers reject a bid or indeed are still here next season we will review that position accordingly,"" it added.  The trust also said it believed the Red Knights had not totally walked away, but were waiting for the price of Manchester United to fall.  ""We understand the intention of the statement from the Red Knights is to remove the time deadline pressure and set more realistic expectations with regard to a bid,"" the trust said.  In its statement, the Red Knights group said: ""We understand that many supporters were hoping that we might be in a position to make a bid before the season ticket renewal deadline.  ""We have never taken a stance on season ticket renewals, it is a personal choice for all supporters."""

815,"Mr Herzog and his wife Christiane were the guests of the Queen and Prince Philip in the first state visit to the castle since the 1992 fire.  The president's four-day visit to the UK is aimed at developing closer relations between the two countries.  It was commissioned by the Dresden Trust, a UK organisation which raised around £300,000 from individuals, charities and companies across the country.  The Queen herself contributed directly to the fund.  It is a symbol of reconciliation between the UK and Germany, and was presented as a gift for the people of Dresden.  Until then it will go on display at Coventry Cathedral, which was itself severely damaged in German bombing raids.  Alan Smith's father piloted a Lancaster bomber which took part in the air raids on the German town.  Mr Smith, a silversmith, said: ""It was one of the things he was never really happy over himself, after the bombing of Dresden.  ""This is now a monument to him, to say sorry, or everything's going to be OK.""  Before the ceremony, a guardsman was injured when his horse reared backwards, missing the Queen's car by inches. He was later discharged from hospital after treatment for a shoulder injury."
816,"An ancient city in what is now Peru was built at the same time as the great pyramids of Egypt, archaeologists have revealed. New evidence indicates the desert site at Caral, on the slopes of the Andes, was built between 2,600 BC and 2,000 BC.    What we're learning from Caral is going to rewrite the way we think about the development of early Andean civilisation    This date pushes back the emergence of the first complex society in the New World by nearly 800 years. And it suggests that the people behind the project were advanced enough to organise the labour needed to create the architectural wonder of the day. Caral is one of 18 sites in central Peru's Supe Valley, which stretches eastward from the Pacific coastline, up the slopes of the Andes. All the inland settlements once had architecture on a grand scale, including the six huge platform mounds seen at Caral. Because of its size and complexity, archaeologists had thought Caral was built about 1,500 BC. But carbon dating of plant samples found at the site add another 1,000 years or so to this figure. That puts Caral in the same period as the great pyramids of Egypt, and long before the huge stone structures of Mexico. ""What we're learning from Caral is going to rewrite the way we think about the development of early Andean civilisation,"" said study leader Jonathan Haas of the Field Museum in Chicago, US. The Peruvian-American archaeological team says the pyramids and irrigation system show an organised society in which masses of people were paid, or compelled, to work on centralised projects. This suggests that power and wealth were held by an elite group at a time when, in most of the Americas, people were still hunting and gathering in much smaller communities. ""The size of a structure is really an indication of power,"" said Haas. ""It means that leaders of the society were able to get their followers to do lots of work."" What is surprising to archaeologists is that the city was created by a society that had yet to invent pottery or cultivate grain. Its people grew peppers, beans, avocadoes and potatoes - all of which they roasted, having no pots to boil them in. They also ate lots of anchovies, which may have been used in dried form as a kind of currency, as grain was later. The research is published in the journal Science."
817,"Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Michael Walker said the media's coverage may have prompted Iraqi insurgents to attack the soldiers.  He told BBC Two's Newsnight programme attacks were ""enhanced"" by reports.  Five members of the 850-strong battlegroup died during attacks when they moved closer to Baghdad.  ""The contribution towards the initial attacks against the Black Watch was certainly enhanced by, if you like, a media picture that was being laid across a number of channels in all sorts of places,"" he said.  The reports meant ""there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and meet us with something like a bomb"", he said.  Most of the attacks on the Black Watch happened during the early stages of their redeployment from Basra to near the Iraqi capital, where they relieved US forces preparing for an attack on the city of Falluja.  They included roadside bombs as well as mortar and small arms attacks on their base at Camp Dogwood.  Gen Walker said: ""Certainly the attacks against the Black Watch happened at that stage.  ""I'm certain, too, that the media coverage would have made it easier for anybody who wanted to conduct those attacks to do so.""  His comments come as debate rages over reporting of military operations in Iraq.  Many reports come from reporters ""embedded"" with units whose coverage is heavily restricted by military censors.  Gen Walker made clear that he did not expect the Black Watch's tour of duty in central Iraq to have won it a reprieve from the re-structuring of the Army.  ""There's no doubt that the way that the Army Board have approached the re-organisation is, in my mind, absolutely right,"" he told Newsnight.  ""We need to get greater flexibility and we need more infantry capability available to be able to conduct the sort of operations we have.""  He declined to give a timetable for British withdrawal from Iraq, saying only: ""In real terms, we know we must stay engaged there for as long as necessary for us to be able to hand off as much of the security apparatus (as possible) to the Iraqi security forces.""  Gen Walker also rejected estimates, published in The Lancet, that around 98,000 Iraqis had died as a result of the war and occupation.  ""I don't think we can put any credibility on that study in straight terms,"" he said.  ""The difficulty with casualties, particularly when they are not your own casualties and are members of the civilian population or the anti-coalition forces is that we don't control the casualty evacuation, so one will never quite know what the figures are."""

824,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

826,"They have filed corruption charges against first lady Wu Shu-chen and three former presidential aides over the alleged misuse of state funds.  President Chen has been undermined by a series of scandals involving his family and his office in recent months.  He has already survived two opposition attempts, including one last month, to remove him from office.  The ruling Democratic Progressive Party said it was meeting on Friday evening to discuss the latest developments.  The charges relate to the handling of a secret presidential fund used for diplomatic work overseas. Officials say around US$500,000 could not be properly accounted for.  During the four-month investigation, officials looked at six separate cases involving the use of the fund. They said the president's explanation for two were verified, but three were questionable and one was described as pure fiction.  The Public Prosecutor's Office of the Taiwan High Court announced on Friday it was filing charges of embezzlement and forgery of documents against Wu Shu-chen.  ""Prosecutors found that Wu and three other suspects jointly claimed 14.8m Taiwan dollars (US$448,484) with false receipts... between July 2002 and March 2006,"" Chang Wen-cheng, of the prosecutor's office, said.  The first lady has previously denied any wrongdoing.  ""Evidence also showed Chen is suspected of graft and forgery... but since he is protected by constitution against criminal charges, he can only be prosecuted after he leaves office,"" Mr Chang said.  Ma Ying-jeou, of the opposition Nationalist Party, said Mr Chen must resign as soon as possible.  ""He has lost the people's trust and respect, and as he is burdened with scandals, he can no longer lead the people nor effectively represent the country,"" he said.  There was no immediate comment from the presidential office.  President Chen has been facing growing calls for his resignation in recent months over the scandals to hit his family and office.  Last month, Wu Shu-chen was cleared of accepting vouchers from a department store in return for her influence.  In May, her son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, was arrested and later charged with insider trading.  Mr Chen, whose term of office is due to run until 2008, has apologised for the scandals and did cede some powers to Prime Minister Su Tseng-chang in June to placate his critics, but has refused to resign.  The scandals have brought tens of thousands of people - both supporters and opponents of the president - out on to the streets to voice their views."

829,"Former Top Gear host Richard Hammond has been flown to hospital after a crash while filming in Switzerland.  The 47-year-old was on a practice run for a race in an electric car for Amazon Prime show The Grand Tour.  Mr Hammond ""climbed out of the car himself before the vehicle burst into flames"", the show said in a statement.  Co-host Jeremy Clarkson tweeted that it was the ""most frightening"" accident he had ever seen but said Mr Hammond, who fractured a knee, was ""mostly OK"".  The show's statement said Mr Hammond had been involved in a ""serious crash"" after completing the Hemberg Hill Climb in Switzerland, where a race takes place on Sunday.  He had been driving a ""Rimac Concept One, an electric super car built in Croatia, during filming for The Grand Tour Season 2 on Amazon Prime, but very fortunately suffered no serious injury"".  Mr Hammond was ""conscious and talking"" after the crash, the show said, and had been flown to hospital in St Gallen ""to be checked over"".  ""Nobody else was in the car or involved in the accident, and we'd like to thank the paramedics on site for their swift response.  ""The cause of the crash is unknown and is being investigated,"" the statement added.  The Hemburg organisers said the official race would take place as planned on Sunday.  A statement said: ""The vehicle left the track and landed in the meadow.""  They added that rescuers had been ""very fast"" to reach the scene.  The crash comes 11 years after Mr Hammond nearly died when he lost control of a Vampire dragster while filming for Top Gear.  He was in a coma for two weeks after the accident at Elvington Airfield, near York.  Mr Hammond, who had been driving at speeds of up to 288mph (463km/h), suffered brain injuries but made a full recovery.  A ""catastrophic disintegration"" of the jet car's front tyre, probably caused by an object like a nail, caused the crash, a BBC report later concluded.  In early March 2017, Mr Hammond said he had fallen off a motorbike ""many times"" while filming an episode of The Grand Tour in Mozambique and ""banged my head"".  But he also said he was ""fine"", although Mr Clarkson told the Sun newspaper that Mr Hammond had ""hurt himself quite badly""."

831,"Home Secretary Theresa May has been criticised for claiming that an illegal immigrant avoided deportation because of his pet cat.  She told the Conservative conference the ruling illustrated the problem with human rights laws, but England's top judges said she had got it wrong.  Her Cabinet colleague Ken Clarke said he had been ""surprised"" by the claim and could not believe it was true.  And human rights campaigners said Mrs May should get ""her facts straight"".  Mrs May made the remark during a speech in which she repeated her belief that the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, ""needs to go"".  She also outlined how she planned to rewrite immigration rules to prevent ""misinterpretation"" of Article 8 of the convention - the right to family life.  She said the meaning of Article 8 had been ""perverted"" and used to prevent the removal of foreign national prisoners and illegal immigrants - more than 100 of whom successfully used it last year to avoid deportation.  She pledged to clear up any ""misconception"" by judges about what it meant.  ""We all know the stories about the Human Rights Act... about the illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat.""  But a spokesman for the Judicial Office at the Royal Courts of Justice, which issues statements on behalf of senior judges, said the pet had ""had nothing to do with"" the judgement allowing the man to stay.  Mrs May told the BBC her speech had been checked before it went out and that the case was ""just one example"" of where she believed the law was being misconstrued.  But she promised she would have ""another look at the case"", if it was proved to be wrong.  Asked about the reference, her Conservative cabinet colleague, Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, told the BBC: ""The cat surprised me. I cannot believe anyone was refused deportation just because they owned a cat.""  Later he told a fringe meeting that the case ""certainly has nothing to do with the Human Rights Act and nothing to do with the European Convention on Human Rights"".  And he said repealing the UK Human Rights Act would mean ""all the cases go back to Strasbourg"", adding: ""I think it is a good idea that we remain adhering to the Convention on Human Rights and the cases are heard here by British judges.""  Mr Clarke said he had not discussed with Mrs May her plan to change immigration rules to reduce the number of foreign criminals successfully using Article 8 to avoid deportation.  But he said it was ""fine"" to ""remind people"" about the scope of Article 8 as he believed there had to be an ""extremely compelling"" reason for convicted foreign criminals to remain in the UK.  For Labour, shadow policing minister Vernon Coaker said the government was not enforcing the rules that already existed.  ""We have the ludicrous spectacle of the home secretary blaming cats whilst letting into the country a sheikh the home secretary thought she had banned and ending up paying him compensation as a result.""  And Amnesty International said Mrs May's comments only fuelled ""myths and misconceptions"" about the Human Rights Act.  ""That someone in Theresa May's position can be so misinformed as to parade out a story about someone being allowed to stay in Britain because of a cat is nothing short of alarming,"" the campaign group said.  ""She urgently needs to get her facts straight.""  The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said what had been intended as a major policy announcement had turned into a public relations shambles with Mrs May ""overreaching herself"" and Mr Clarke appearing out of the loop.  The case at the centre of the row occurred in 2008 and involved a Bolivian student who said he could show he had a proper permanent relationship with his partner and should not be deported.  The Bolivian man eventually won his case on appeal because the Home Office had ignored its own immigration rules on unmarried couples."

837,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure.

840,"As people in South Korea debate the merits of eating dog meat ahead of the football World Cup, dog restaurants in Vietnam are doing well.  Dog is a popular dish in the country, where it is eaten for its protein and also for good luck.  It is particularly popular in the urban areas of the north where increasing incomes have sparked a search for new and more exotic recipes.  At a busy restaurant in Hanoi, a woman weighs and chops up small puppies for her customers.  There are about seven dishes featuring dog meat, and they often include the head, feet and internal organs.  Dog meat has a strong smell and taste. It is heavily spiced and usually served with alcohol.  Diners are mostly men - they believe it will make them more virile. But eating dog is reserved for the second half of the lunar month. Dog meat sellers do good business then, with many customers who believe they will dispel their misfortunes by eating the meat.  The dogs are small with long bodies and short legs, best eaten at about a year old. They come from puppy farms or are collected from the countryside.  It is common to see them in the streets of the capital, crammed into wire cages or cooked and skinned on the backs of motorbikes. They are killed with a blow, boiled to remove the fur and roasted.  People who keep dogs as pets are very cautious of their safety, and if a dog is seen on the street, it is usually an exotic breed being watched by one of the family.  Many people are comfortable with the idea of loving their pet and following what they see as the natural order of eating chicken, pork or dog meat.  While eating dog is permitted, eating cats has been made illegal in an effort to reduce the number of rats and mice.  Cats are usually kept tied up or in cages, partly so that their miaows frighten the rodents and partly, as many believe, to protect them from being stolen for illicit cat restaurants."
841,"The Irish Citizen Army (ICA) was formed during the Dublin labour dispute in 1913. Its purpose was to enable the locked-out men to defend themselves in clashes with the Dublin Metropolitan Police and to counteract the demoralizing effects of unemployment by providing discipline, cohesion and purpose. The idea of forming a force appears to have been first formally proposed by Captain JR White in 1913 - an ex-army officer from County Antrim, who had been educated at Winchester College and Sandhurst. During a speech in August, James Larkin had already suggested that the workers form a force as Carson had done; he publicly repeated this instruction on 13th November 1913. James Connolly likewise urged the men to train ""as they are doing in Ulster"". Two weeks later drilling began. According to the ICA constitution, its members were to ‘work for an Irish republic and for the emancipation of labour’. Larkin was anxious that those who enlisted should not only espouse these principles but also be members of unions recognised by the Irish Trade Union Congress.  Despite competition from the Irish Volunteer Force - launched 25th November 1913 - ICA membership quickly reached over 1,000. However, after the dispute was over (January 1914) and the men returned to work, the ‘army’ all but disappeared. But it was Connolly above all who, after his appointment as its commandant and as leader of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (October 1914), rescued it from terminal decline and welded it into a potent force and potential weapon for his own use. He determined its structure, vetted its officers and imposed a rigid discipline. He also demanded an ideological commitment to revolution and the goal of an independent Irish socialist republic. The force’s guiding principle was that ‘the ownership of Ireland, moral and material, is vested by right in the people of Ireland’. Its membership remained small – 220 in 1916 – but it was otherwise superior to the much larger IVF in its unity of purpose, lack of factional and ideological division and in the quality of its training.  After the outbreak of World War I, Connolly had become increasingly committed to fomenting an insurrection in Ireland. This was reflected in his military preparations with the ICA; he used its headquarters, Liberty Hall as his base. Fearing he might act on his own, and recognising the merits of collaboration, the Irish Republican Brotherhood Military Council informed him of their own clandestine plans for a rising and an agreement was reached. During Easter week, 219 ICA men fought alongside over 1,300 from the IVF. As the appointed leader of both forces in Dublin, Connolly skilfully ensured that the ideological and social divisions and personality clashes, which had hitherto blighted their relationship, were largely overcome. ICA forces were mainly concentrated at the GPO, the College of Surgeons and Dublin’s City Hall. They won volunteer admiration for their professionalism, dedication, and ruthlessness. Two of their leaders were subsequently executed – Connolly and Michael Mallin (ICA Chief of Staff); Countess Markievicz (Mallin`s second-in command) was reprieved. Others were imprisoned or interned. The ICA was not revived after the insurrection. The new leadership of the ITGWU focussed instead on building up the union, safeguarding members’ wages and improving working conditions."
842,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.

843,"      Have your say    What happens when you take recently found recordings of a legendary (and now deceased) singer from West Asia and give them to a reggae obsessed, Italian DJ in London in 2007? The result is Dub Qawwali, an album released to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the passing of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.      Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (1948-1997) was a Pakistani Sufi praise singer whose music was called “qawwali”. Nusrat was the latest in an unbroken family lineage of qawwali singers stretching back over the last 600 years. Among other honorary titles bestowed upon him, Nusrat was called Shahenshah-e-Qawwali, meaning The Emperor of Qawwali. His multi-octave voice possessed such transcendent power that he became the first Pakistani musician to win over substantial international audiences. Gaudi DJs at clubs and events across the globe while somehow finding time to release – so far - eleven solo albums and soundtracks, plus 80 remix albums. He calls his personalized, flowing techno-reggae style “Gaudi-dub.”      In 2005 Gaudi began conceiving a new production—composing original music for unreleased Nusrat recordings recently discovered in Pakistan. Slowly building loops of sound around Nusrat’s huge, curling vocal, Gaudi began to build the project he states he is today most proud of: Dub Qawwali. “Stylistically, I’m trying to fuse different cultures, genres and sounds while keeping the unifying element of love,” Gaudi explains.      Considered a legend both in and outside of his home country, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was dubbed the ‘Elvis of the East’ and travelled the world promoting his unique brand of music inspired by the mystical faith of Sufi Islam. His untimely death left behind a vast repertoire of performances that have been sampled by countless DJs and composers over recent years. Even more potent in spreading the Nusrat legend has been the use of Khan’s voice on the soundtracks to several acclaimed films including Bandit Queen, The Last Temptation of Christ and Dead Man Walking. Directors find the huge (yet subtle) spiritual power conveyed by Nusrat appropriate accompaniment to cinematic scenes of great emotional impact.      Gaudi’s understanding of Jamaican dub technology lets him build an epic soundscape around Khan’s magisterial voice. Dub Qawwali takes the legendary art of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan into new musical territory.     Garth Cartwright    http://www.myspace.com/gaudimusic  CD Review on BBC Music     Read other people's comments then  Tell us what you think:     Naseem Zia, Australia  Please dont think like HALF GLASS IS EMPTY, I am surprised on Gaudi's selection. He selected the one and only one Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Best wishes Guadi Amir Khan, U.S.A  I am Pakistani/American World Music composer. So I was excited to learn that a European musician has utilized NFAK's recently found recordings in his new album.However, I am very disappointed to hear the result. I am sure Gaudi is good at what he does. Unfortunately, often, eastern classical singing cannot be simply backed with western chords. The result is that within the first 12 sec of the recording, NFAT sounds ""off"" (which I am sure he is not but rather due to orchestration/chords used in the background). The same thing happens again at 2:08 min into the recording.I think the overall sound or feeling of the song has to be appealing to your ears. In my humble opinion, this song is not. irfan pakistan  what a classic excellent remix...great gaudi keep it up. Rob Constantin  This album Dub Qawwali is simply fantastic! Excellent production, quality songs, fresh ideas and innovative style crossing reggae culture with sufi, for me this is a masterpiece! maya (BZH) & london  This album is just fantastic!!!I fly every day on it...beautifulthanks soo muchmaya DJ Don't F*** About  Gaudi rules, he should easily win one of your awards Sarah Flavell  No, no, no, no, no, no!This is an awful desecration of wonderful music. It sounds like someone is just playing bad reggae in the background. hasan khalid, US  i am a huge fan of Nusrat and Gaudi gave it new style, i liked it Naveed Awan Khan, London  Qawalli is timeless and doesnt but this album will age and is wrong. Its like the Bally Sagoo production which is rubbish. Gaudi has tried but it falls short. KANWALJIT SINGH INDIA  I LOVE NUSRAT SONGS. THIS SONG IS ALSO VERY EXCELLENT AS OTHERS SONGS OF NUSRAT stephan wikkler (Sweden)  I really love this cd, Sufi music and reggae music combined in the most beautiful way. the production in here is perfect!! Gaudi did an incredible job, and of course the inimitable voice of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan gives to this album a unique and ""top level"" touch! thank you. Stephan mark (brighton - uk)  this album Dub Qawwali is a gem!!! superb production by Gaudi, gives an extra amazing ""dub touch"" to the beautiful voice of a true legend: Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Gaudi/Khan a perfet combination! Shafat, Kashmir, India  Just Awesome!!!! Just a step behind Night Song. Remixed very well otherwise considering that Nusrat was around in this one as he was very much active during Night Song Karen B. Manchester UK  The album ""Dub qawwali"" by Gaudi + Nusrat is simply splendid! OMG when i bought it 2 months ago i couldn't believe my ears....reggae/dub and Qawwali music together in perfect symbiosis, Gaudi did an incredible job! The production of this album is truly immaculate! K.B.

847,"Malcolm Glazer, the billionaire who led a controversial takeover of Manchester United, has died aged 85.  The Glazer family purchased United for £790m in May 2005 amid protests from the Premier League club's fans.  ""Malcolm Glazer never set foot in Old Trafford but was a figurehead of that controversial takeover of Manchester United. ""In terms of practicalities and the day-to-day running of the club, very little will change and the business will continue to be run on the same basis it has been for a number of years. ""The club's debt payments have been reduced, but I think it is fair to say fan anger over those debts remains and will not go away.""  However, they went on to win five Premier League titles and the Champions League under his ownership.  The New York-born American's sons, Joel and Avram, took over the day-to-day running of the club after their father suffered a stroke in April 2006.  ""The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United are with his family,"" said a spokesman for the Premier League club.  The club's Dutch striker Robin van Persie, 30, tweeted: ""My condolences go out to the Glazer family and friends.""  The Glazer family retain a 90% share in United - split equally among Glazer's six children - with 10% listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Glazer, who never actually set foot inside Old Trafford, gradually bought out United shareholders between 2003 and 2005.  His takeover was largely funded by loans secured against the club's assets, a move that took them heavily into debt and sat uneasily with many fans at Old Trafford.  Manchester United Supporters' Trust vice-chair Sean Bones said: ""It would be inappropriate for me to make any comment about the death of Malcolm Glazer as I didn't know him or his family personally.  ""However, as a supporter, I am aware of the detrimental effect the Glazers have had on the football club and the huge debt that has been placed on Manchester United.""  Supporters' group Shareholders United were one of the most vociferous anti-Glazer voices during the takeover, and in the aftermath.  In 2010, a group of lifelong United fans made up of City bankers and lawyers set up the Red Knights consortium in an attempt to buy the club with the support of fans, but their plans failed.  The club had no debts before the Glazer family takeover but now owe around £400m. Yet, despite a turbulent 2013-14 season which resulted in the sacking of manager David Moyes, United still generate record revenue, with turnover set to exceed £418m in the 2013-14 financial year.  Football finance expert Professor Tom Cannon from the University of Liverpool told BBC Radio 5 live: ""He had a massive impact on the club. He loaded them with a lot of debt while at the same time building up their commercial side until it became a global phenomenon, so two very striking differences.  ""Floating 10% of the club on the New York Stock Exchange made the club more exposed to the vagaries of the stock market and some would argue one of the factors that led to the dismissal of David Moyes was the fact that the stock market was declining, the price was declining.""  Glazer was also the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he will be remembered much more fondly for turning one of American football's least successful franchises into Super Bowl winners following his takeover in 1995.  Former Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden, who led the team to that Super Bowl triumph, said: ""He was a friend and a trailblazer. I'll miss him and I thank him for believing in me. My condolences to the Glazer family and to the Bucs organization.""  The Glazers are a very close knit but large family. There's no doubt Malcolm Glazer was the patriarch who led the initiative and in a sense held them together. One of the concerns now might be whether you get the situation you've seen in the past, even in English football, where you get divided opinions within members of the family - some wanting to sell, to cash in, some wanting to hold on.

""His dedication to the community was evident in all he did, including his leadership in bringing Super Bowls to Tampa Bay. Malcolm's commitment to the Bucs, the NFL and the people of the Tampa Bay region are the hallmarks of his legacy.""  Glazer's business career started when he took over the family watch-parts business aged 15, following the death of his father.  He invested in other businesses and acquired a diverse portfolio of international holdings and public companies, including First Allied, Zapata Corporation, Houlihan's Restaurant Chain, Harley Davidson, Formica, Tonka, Specialty Equipment and Omega Protein.  Glazer is survived by his wife Linda, his six children and 14 grandchildren."

849,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
850,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

852,"               The Duke of Kent has presented a replica orb and cross to Dresden's cathedral to mark the 55th anniversary of the allied bombing of the German city.      The gilded orb and cross replaces those destroyed in the devastating bomb attack by Allied planes on February 13, 1945, which killed tens of thousands of civilians.       [It is a] symbol of peace and reconciliation for the future    The raid, by 796 Lancasters and nine Mosquitos, was part of the Allied policy of saturation bombing German cities.      Ata a ceremony attended by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Saxony Governor Kurt Biedenkopf, the Duke praised German efforts to rebuild the former East German city and the famous Frauenkirche Lutheran cathedral.    Duke of Kent (right) is president of the Dresden Trust   The Duke described the orb and cross as a potent symbol of suffering, reconciliation and rebirth.      They will stand 300ft above the ground, topping the stone dome of the 18th-century baroque cathedral, which collapsed after two days of Allied bombing, when the temperature of the masonry reached an estimated 1,000C.      Crowning feature      The eight-metre high orb and cross were made in London by goldsmiths Grant Macdonald and paid for by British donations to the Dresden Trust, of which the Duke is president.    One of the craftsmen, Alan Smith, is the son of a British pilot involved in the 1945 Dresden raid. Mr Smith, 52, led an eight-month project to recreate the 23ft crowning feature of the Frauenkirche.      His late father, Frank, was a pilot in 57 Squadron which carried out the raid.      The chairman of the Dresden Trust, Alan Russell, said: ""I think what we have been able to do has had a very considerable healing effect not only for the Dresdeners but also for the British people involved,"" he said.      The Foundation for the Reconstruction of the Frauenkirche was formed in 1990 and money has been raised for the fund in Germany, America and Britain.      The rebuilding programme began in 1993 and is scheduled to be completed in 2006 - Dresden's eighth centenary."
853,"Gerry Conlon, who was wrongly convicted of the 1974 Guildford IRA pub bombing, has died aged 60 after an illness.  He was one of the Guildford Four, who spent 15 years in prison before their convictions were quashed in 1989.  Mr Conlon's family said his fight for justice had ""forced the world's closed eyes to be opened to injustice"".  His case was highlighted in the 1993 Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.  The Guildford Four were convicted amid the backdrop of an IRA bombing campaign targeting pubs in England.  High-profile attacks were carried out in Guildford, Woolwich and Birmingham in 1974.  Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson were jailed for life in 1975 for an attack on the Horse and Groom pub in Guildford which killed four soldiers and a civilian, as well as injuring scores more.  All those involved vigorously protested their innocence.  The Court of Appeal quashed their sentences in October 1989, amid doubts raised about the police evidence against them.  An investigation into the case by Avon and Somerset Police found serious flaws in the way Surrey Police handled the case - considered to be one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in Britain.  The perpetrators of the Guildford bomb attack have never been brought to justice.  When he emerged from court after his conviction was quashed, Mr Conlon said: ""I have been in prison for something I did not do. I am totally innocent.""  In 2009, he wrote about the emotional problems he endured as a result of his incarceration, revealing that he had suffered two breakdowns, and attempted suicide. He also developed an addiction to alcohol and drugs.  Mr Conlon died at his home in the Falls Road area of west Belfast after an illness.  In a statement issued through his lawyer Gareth Peirce, Mr Conlon's family said: ""He brought life, love, intelligence, wit and strength to our family through its darkest hours.  ""He helped us to survive what we were not meant to survive.  ""We recognise that what he achieved by fighting for justice for us had a far, far greater importance - it forced the world's closed eyes to be opened to injustice; it forced unimaginable wickedness to be acknowledged; we believe it changed the course of history.  ""We thank him for his life and we thank all his many friends for their love.""  After Mr Conlon was jailed for the pub bombing, seven people were arrested because of a family connection to him.  Among them was Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe, who was arrested while travelling to London from Belfast to help his son.  They became known, as the Maguire Seven and were convicted and jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited.  The sentences given the Maguire Seven were overturned by the Court of Appeal in June 1991.  Annie Maguire, who was one of the Maguire Seven, described Mr Conlon's death as ""very sad news"".  ""I am sad to hear he has died so young, and am sorry for his sisters,"" she said.  Paul Hill said: ""I think he suffered a great deal more than the other individuals involved, myself included, because Gerard could never have release of his father.  ""I always said that Gerard's father was continuously imprisoned in Gerard's mind.  ""Not only did he feel responsible (for his father's death in prison), but every time he looked at his mother, the late Sarah, I think he seen his father. That was Gerard's problem.""  SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell said Mr Conlon had been a ""close friend"".  ""Gerry had a strong sense of social justice and an uncompromising desire to right the wrongs that had been suffered by others,"" he said.  ""The miscarriage of justice that Gerry, his father and friends suffered was terrible and appalling.  ""He was a shining light in the search for truth and a tireless campaigner for justice.""  Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said: ""Gerry and his father Giuseppe were two of the most infamous examples of miscarriages of justice by the British political and judicial system.""  In 2005, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a public apology to the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven for the miscarriages of justice they had suffered."

856,"      Aspects of Iain Duncan Smith's CV, relating to his education, are inaccurate and misleading, an investigation by BBC Newsnight reveals.    The investigation into the Conservative Party leader's education and early career - broadcast at 10.30pm on BBC TWO last night (Wednesday 18 December 2002) - was presented by Michael Crick, author of the best-selling biography of Jeffrey Archer.    If any of the following material is used BBC Newsnight must be credited.       Iain Duncan Smith's biography on the Conservative Party website, his entry in Who's Who, and various other places, state that he went to the Universita di Perugia in Italy.    This is not true: his office now admit that he went to the Universita per Stranieri, which is also in Perugia.    The Universita per Stranieri - or University for Foreigners - was founded in 1921 and is a totally separate institution to the medieval Universita di Perugia, founded by the Pope in 1308.    Although the Universita per Stranieri is a respected language school, it did not grant degrees when he studied there in 1973, although some students attained diplomas.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now admitted to Newsnight that he didn't get any qualifications in Perugia or even finish his exams.       The first line of Iain Duncan Smith's biography, on the Conservative Party website, claims he was ""educated at Dunchurch College of Management"".    In fact, Dunchurch was the former staff college for GEC Marconi, for whom he worked in the 1980s.    Mr Duncan Smith's office has now confirmed to Newsnight that he did not get any qualifications there either, but that he completed six separate courses lasting a few days each, adding up to about a month in total.    Newsnight has now spoken to 19 former tutors at Dunchurch. Most agree it is over-emphasising his experience at Dunchurch to describe it in the way he does.    John Garside, a former Dunchurch tutor, says: ""I'm puzzled, flattered, but puzzled. What we did was offer short courses... it was not a continuous form of education by any means.""    Newsnight has shown these details to some of Iain Duncan Smith's constituents in Chingford.    Several people assumed he must have been at both the University of Perugia and Dunchurch for several years, and obtained qualifications in either or both places.

857,"The latest two sub-kiloton tests were carried out on the Pokhran range in the Rajasthan desert at 1221 Indian Standard Time (0621 GMT).  The statement said that the tests were fully contained and there was no release of radioactivity into the atmosphere.  The statement added that the government of India reiterated its offer of considering to adhere to some of the undertakings in the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty under the framework of the proposals in a statement made on May 11.  The BBC Delhi correspondent says that supported by public opinion, the Indian Government is confident it can deal with the consequences.  The opposition Congress party in India has criticised the government for carrying out the series of nuclear tests.  Party spokesman, Salman Khursheed, accused the governing Bharatiya Janta Party of trying to use the tests for political ends rather than to enhance the country's national security.  Mr Khursheed said the government had failed to clearly explain why the tests were necessary.  President Clinton has signed documents imposing sanctions against India for conducting the nuclear testing programme. American officials say that full details will be announced later.  Pakistan says India 'has gone berserk'  Pakistan has bitterly condemned the latest Indian tests. The Pakistani Foreign Minister, Gohar Ayub Khan, said that the Indian leadership seemed to have gone ""berserk"" and was acting in a totally unrestrained way.  Japan has suspended its 3.5bn yen annual grant aid to India in protest at New Delhi's first round of testing.  The spokesman for the BJP, the dominant party in India's coalition government, IK Malkani, stood by the decision and attacked American ""hypocrisy"" in imposing sanctions.  He also denied that his party was making political capital out of grassroots support for the tests. ""For 30 years, our party has been urging that India should go nuclear and now that we have the power and the opportunity we have gone nuclear - that's all,"" he told BBC World Television.  On Monday, the Indian Government moved to counter widespread international criticism it incurred after conducting its first three nuclear tests.  The Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee wrote to leaders of the world's major powers to explain the reasons for the tests."
858,"All accounts of the British constitution start with Professor Albert Venn Dicey (1835-1922).  As Vernon Bogdanor acknowledges, it was Dicey who first analysed the British constitution and emphasised its historic nature.  It was also Dicey who explained that much of our constitution is based on conventions.  These conventions are customs or rules that are respected as a fundamental part of our constitution even though they are not enforceable as rules of law.  Here are some of the examples quoted by Dicey in 1885:  When the House of Lords acts as a court of appeal, peers who are not law lords take no part in the proceedings. These conventions remain part of our constitution. Others have developed since Dicey's time. Indeed, the whole system of cabinet government depends on constitutional conventions. Take the Prime Minister, for example. Britain has had one since the eighteenth century, but not because parliament sat down one afternoon and said so. Indeed, it was not until 1917 that a statute first noticed we had such a person, when the official 'now popularly known as Prime Minister' was allowed to live at Chequers. By the same reckoning the cabinet was first spotted in 1937 when parliament decided its members would receive salaries; likewise the Leader of the Opposition. The Ministers of the Crown Act 1937 did mention in passing that there were such things as political parties, but it was not until 1969 that MPs came out of the closet and allowed party descriptions to be printed on ballot papers. Constitutional conventions do not last for ever. As they have not been created by law they do not need formal repeal: people simply stop observing them. There was apparently once a convention that the Home Secretary should be present at a royal birth. Times change - and so do constitutional conventions."

In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect.

""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.

Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
861,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government.

The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests.""

865,"With coal a nationalised industry, and some British mines unprofitable, coal mining was ripe for repositioning - and even privatisation - by Margaret Thatcher's right wing Conservative government of the 1980s. In the early 1980s, the National Union of Miners (NUM) was very strong, with high membership and strong links to the Labour Party. It was also defiantly left wing and militant, with no compunction against threatening industrial action. In 1981, there was the threat of strike when pit closures were mooted, and the government backed down, not feeling its position was strong enough. In 1983, Thatcher appointed Ian MacGregor head of the National Coal Board, which oversaw the industry. He had a reputation for swingeing cutbacks and closures from his previous role at British Steel. The coal industry was ripe for further confrontation between the NUM and the government, and resolutions were passed by various NUM regions to strike if pits were closed for reasons other than geological or resource exhaustion. By the end of 1983, with the Falklands War won and a mandate from that year's general election, Thatcher felt far more secure in her position and was willing to tackle the unions. The struggle over the mining industry would largely come to define her premiership.  In 1984, the announcement came that 20 pits were to close, with 20,000 jobs to go. It was later disclosed that the government, in preparation for the much-anticipated industrial action, had been stockpiling coal to take Britain through the winter. Initial locally-organised strikes across the UK became a national NUM strike in March 1984. But NUM leader Arthur Scargill decreed that NUM regions could decide whether or not to strike on an independent basis. Margaret Thatcher ratcheted up the pressure by referring to striking miners as ""the enemy within"". She continually referred to the action as ""the rule of the mob"". Scargill, in turn, compared the government's techniques in crowd control to those of a ""Latin American state"". The dispute had little chance of ending amicably or quickly. As the strike continued, strains and stresses began to be felt. The workers earned no money and were ineligible for benefits as the strike was deemed illegal; they had to rely on scrimping, saving and handouts. Personal relationships strained and sometimes broke as some decided to work through the strike, becoming 'scabs' in the lexicon of industrial relations. On the picket lines, buses carrying 'scabs' were attacked, and other disturbances took place. Miners clashed with massed ranks of police repeatedly and fiercely all over the country. Some industrial unions supported the miners and some disagreed, to the extent that the government gathered information from them. Observance of the strike within Wales differed from north to south. In the north, only 35% of the 1,000 men employed went on strike, and this had dwindled to 10% by the strike's end in 1985. By contrast, the south Wales coalfield contained the staunchest supporters of industrial action. At the start of the strike, 99.6% of the 21,500 workers joined the action. This reduced to 93% by the end. No other area retained such a level. With so many men not working in an area which was almost single-industry, South Wales suffered hugely with deprivation and community breakdown. Some areas broke down irretrievably, with the effects visible for years afterwards in ghost villages in the Valleys.  One incident in south Wales accelerated the ending the strike and turned some otherwise sympathetic members of the public against the miners. The killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver, was a tragedy and a public relations disaster for the NUM. Wilkie was driving David Williams, a working miner, to the Merthyr Vale mine with a police escort on 30 November 1984. Two striking miners dropped a 21kg concrete block from a bridge onto the car, killing Wilkie instantly. This coincided with a gradual slide in public and media support for the action, amid scandals and accusations. Families found it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves and the NUM funds were running too low to pay for pickets' transport. The official end of the strike came on 3 March 1985, when a vote was passed to return to work even without a new agreement with management. The pits closed rapidly over the next few years, and in 1994 the industry was finally privatised. In 1995 miners famously bought the Tower Colliery in the Cynon Valley, which opened in 1805, to keep it as a going concern. It became Wales' only working coal mine, and the oldest continuously worked deep-coal mine in the UK. That too, is closing due to dwindling coal seams, bringing to an end an industry which once employed almost 200,000 men."

867,"All accounts of the British constitution start with Professor Albert Venn Dicey (1835-1922).  As Vernon Bogdanor acknowledges, it was Dicey who first analysed the British constitution and emphasised its historic nature.  It was also Dicey who explained that much of our constitution is based on conventions.  These conventions are customs or rules that are respected as a fundamental part of our constitution even though they are not enforceable as rules of law.  Here are some of the examples quoted by Dicey in 1885:  When the House of Lords acts as a court of appeal, peers who are not law lords take no part in the proceedings. These conventions remain part of our constitution. Others have developed since Dicey's time. Indeed, the whole system of cabinet government depends on constitutional conventions. Take the Prime Minister, for example. Britain has had one since the eighteenth century, but not because parliament sat down one afternoon and said so. Indeed, it was not until 1917 that a statute first noticed we had such a person, when the official 'now popularly known as Prime Minister' was allowed to live at Chequers. By the same reckoning the cabinet was first spotted in 1937 when parliament decided its members would receive salaries; likewise the Leader of the Opposition. The Ministers of the Crown Act 1937 did mention in passing that there were such things as political parties, but it was not until 1969 that MPs came out of the closet and allowed party descriptions to be printed on ballot papers. Constitutional conventions do not last for ever. As they have not been created by law they do not need formal repeal: people simply stop observing them. There was apparently once a convention that the Home Secretary should be present at a royal birth. Times change - and so do constitutional conventions."

869,"Renegade soldiers in Mali have looted the presidential palace in the capital, Bamako, after a coup.  The coup leaders went on state TV to announce that they have seized control of the country and closed the borders.  A government official told the BBC that President Amadou Toumani Toure is safe and not in the custody of mutineers.  There has been widespread international condemnation of the coup, with the African Union describing it as a ""significant setback for Mali"".  The UN Security Council called for the ""immediate restoration of constitutional rule and the democratically elected government"".  The World Bank and African Development Bank announced they were suspending all aid until the crisis is resolved.  The mutiny comes as no surprise. Last Friday, Ecowas made an announcement that it is going to support, militarily, the national army to defeat the Tuareg. Discussions are still under way but they need to go beyond discussions and act promptly. The region is still failing to anticipate early warning signs, such as the downfall of Libya's [former leader] Muammar Gaddafi and the anticipated impact this would have on security in the Sahel. African leaders need to choose when it is proper for dialogue and when it is proper to protect the territorial integrity of the country using the means that are at their disposal. President Amadou Toumani Toure failed to anticipate this and I think most African leaders failed to advise him wisely on this issue.  Kenya's Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula and his delegation are stranded in the country, as Bamako's airport is closed, after attending an AU meeting on peace and security.  The West African regional body Ecowas said the mutinous soldiers' behaviour was ""reprehensible"" and ""misguided"".  The soldiers, calling themselves the Committee for the Re-establishment of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDR), said they would hand over power to an elected government.  ""The objective of the CNRDR does not in any way aim to confiscate power, and we solemnly swear to return power to a democratically elected president as soon as national unity and territorial integrity are established,"" they said in a statement.  The soldiers said they had led Wednesday's mutiny because the government had not giving them enough arms to tackle a rebellion by ethnic Tuareg in the north of Mali.  They attacked the presidential palace, traded gunfire with soldiers loyal to the government and took over the state radio and TV broadcaster in Bamako and took it off air.  After several hours of footage of traditional Malian music and dancing, a group of soldiers appeared on screen early on Thursday morning.  The leader of the mutiny was revealed to be Capt Amadou Sanogo, who appeared briefly to announce the imposition of a national curfew, although he did not specifying the time and said the constitution had been suspended.  The BBC's Martin Vogl, who is in the capital, says soldiers were seen taking televisions and other goods out of the palace following the coup announcement.  Our correspondent says it is possible that the coup may falter, pointing out that the mutinous troops are poorly equipped, led by a mid-ranking soldier and they do not have the backing of all Malian forces.  The well-trained and organised Red Berets unit is loyal to the president and he is believed to be under their protection, our reporter says.  If those officers decide to push back, they could perhaps overturn the coup, he says.  In a second statement, read on state television on Thursday morning, the renegade troops called on soldiers who took part in the mutiny to stop shooting in the air in order to restore calm in Bamako.  They announced that all borders were closed and asked for civil servants to resume activities next week.  A source told the BBC that the foreign minister and a number of other ministers had been arrested by the renegade soldiers.  A government official, who told the BBC the president was safe, did not give any further details about his whereabouts.  Meanwhile, in the northern town of Gao, renegade soldiers said they had detained loyalist military chiefs in military barracks, according to the AFP news agency.  Mali has had democratic rule for the last 20 years, during which it has come to be considered as a model which other emerging democracies can look to.  The unrest began on Wednesday as the country's defence minister started a tour of military barracks north of the capital.  Soldiers upset with the government's handling of the Tuareg rebellion fired in the air during the inspection, prompting an immediate strengthening of security around the presidential palace.  The Tuaregs have forced the army out of several northern towns in recent months.  A presidential election was due to take place in the country in just under a month.  The government had so far refused to postpone the poll, despite the unrest involving Tuareg-led rebels.  Both the US and France have urged the soldiers and government to resolve their dispute through peaceful means."

871,"Malcolm Glazer, the billionaire who led a controversial takeover of Manchester United, has died aged 85.  The Glazer family purchased United for £790m in May 2005 amid protests from the Premier League club's fans.  ""Malcolm Glazer never set foot in Old Trafford but was a figurehead of that controversial takeover of Manchester United. ""In terms of practicalities and the day-to-day running of the club, very little will change and the business will continue to be run on the same basis it has been for a number of years. ""The club's debt payments have been reduced, but I think it is fair to say fan anger over those debts remains and will not go away.""  However, they went on to win five Premier League titles and the Champions League under his ownership.  The New York-born American's sons, Joel and Avram, took over the day-to-day running of the club after their father suffered a stroke in April 2006.  ""The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United are with his family,"" said a spokesman for the Premier League club.  The club's Dutch striker Robin van Persie, 30, tweeted: ""My condolences go out to the Glazer family and friends.""  The Glazer family retain a 90% share in United - split equally among Glazer's six children - with 10% listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Glazer, who never actually set foot inside Old Trafford, gradually bought out United shareholders between 2003 and 2005.  His takeover was largely funded by loans secured against the club's assets, a move that took them heavily into debt and sat uneasily with many fans at Old Trafford.  Manchester United Supporters' Trust vice-chair Sean Bones said: ""It would be inappropriate for me to make any comment about the death of Malcolm Glazer as I didn't know him or his family personally.  ""However, as a supporter, I am aware of the detrimental effect the Glazers have had on the football club and the huge debt that has been placed on Manchester United.""  Supporters' group Shareholders United were one of the most vociferous anti-Glazer voices during the takeover, and in the aftermath.  In 2010, a group of lifelong United fans made up of City bankers and lawyers set up the Red Knights consortium in an attempt to buy the club with the support of fans, but their plans failed.  The club had no debts before the Glazer family takeover but now owe around £400m. Yet, despite a turbulent 2013-14 season which resulted in the sacking of manager David Moyes, United still generate record revenue, with turnover set to exceed £418m in the 2013-14 financial year.  Football finance expert Professor Tom Cannon from the University of Liverpool told BBC Radio 5 live: ""He had a massive impact on the club. He loaded them with a lot of debt while at the same time building up their commercial side until it became a global phenomenon, so two very striking differences.  ""Floating 10% of the club on the New York Stock Exchange made the club more exposed to the vagaries of the stock market and some would argue one of the factors that led to the dismissal of David Moyes was the fact that the stock market was declining, the price was declining.""  Glazer was also the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he will be remembered much more fondly for turning one of American football's least successful franchises into Super Bowl winners following his takeover in 1995.  Former Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden, who led the team to that Super Bowl triumph, said: ""He was a friend and a trailblazer. I'll miss him and I thank him for believing in me. My condolences to the Glazer family and to the Bucs organization.""  The Glazers are a very close knit but large family. There's no doubt Malcolm Glazer was the patriarch who led the initiative and in a sense held them together. One of the concerns now might be whether you get the situation you've seen in the past, even in English football, where you get divided opinions within members of the family - some wanting to sell, to cash in, some wanting to hold on. That's going to be the big question in the short to medium term and of course the next few weeks are crucial for Manchester United and it may be there's a hiatus while they sort out that kind of issue.  Hall of Fame defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who played a major part in the Super Bowl XXXVII success, tweeted: ""One time for my owner & great man #RipBoss.""  Buccaneers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy also took to Twitter to pay tribute: ""Rest in peace to the driving force that helped transform the organization that changed my life forever.

872,"Mr Van Rompuy was widely tipped, but Baroness Ashton was not EU leaders have chosen the Belgian Prime Minister, Herman van Rompuy, to be the first permanent European Council President. The other top job created by the Lisbon Treaty - foreign affairs supremo - has gone to the EU Trade Commissioner, Baroness Catherine Ashton from the UK. Both are seen as consensual politicians with limited foreign policy experience. Both had unanimous backing from the 27 EU leaders at the summit in Brussels, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Earlier, the UK government had said it was no longer pushing for former PM Tony Blair to get the presidency post. Mr Van Rompuy, 62, had crucial French and German support. He has a reputation as a coalition builder, having taken charge of the linguistically divided Belgian government and steered it out of a crisis. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations,"" he told a news conference after his appointment. ""Even if unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth,"" he said, stressing the individuality of EU member states. Baroness Ashton, 53, said she felt ""deeply privileged"" to get the foreign affairs post. ""I was the first woman British commissioner, the first woman trade commissioner, so I am also proud to be the first woman High Representative,"" she said. ""I think there was a strong push to have at least one woman in a senior position,"" she told the BBC later, adding that she hoped Europe would become ""an economic superpower"". US President Barack Obama said the appointments would ""strengthen the EU and enable it to be an even stronger partner to the United States"". ""The United States has no stronger partner than Europe in advancing security and prosperity around the world,"" the White House said in a statement. Earlier, a UK government spokesman revealed the dramatic twist in the British position. Against all expectations this deal was done in a matter of hours, the pre-summit deadlock broken by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His decision to abandon Tony Blair's bid for the new post of President of the European Council meant the field was left clear for the Belgian prime minister, Herman van Rompuy. It also meant that he could bag for a Briton the second job of the night - one arguably more important and probably higher-profile - that of High Representative, something close to a foreign minister for Europe. Neither Mr Van Rompuy nor Baroness Ashton are what might be called big-hitters. Their selection indicates a preference for a low-key start to these new jobs.    The UK persuaded the other six leaders in the socialist group to back Baroness Ashton, having dropped Tony Blair. EU leaders met in Brussels especially to select their first full-time president and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs - new posts created by the Lisbon Treaty, which will come into force on 1 December. The idea under Lisbon is to give the EU more coherence and continuity in key policy areas. Up until now the presidency has been held by member states in turn, on a six-month rotation. Going into the meeting the leaders had various candidates to choose from. There were fears that the negotiations would go on late into the night, but it quickly emerged that a deal had been struck. Mr Brown praised Mr Van Rompuy as ""a consensus builder"" who had ""brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty"". Turning to Baroness Ashton's appointment, he said ""it gives Britain a powerful voice within the Council and the [EU] Commission. He is camera-shy, a man who some refer to as the ""grey mouse""    ""It will ensure that Britain's voice is very loud and clear. It will ensure that Britain remains at the heart of Europe."" Baroness Ashton ""is the first woman to hold such a high position in the EU,"" he added. Commenting on the choice, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: ""It's so important that Britain remains at the heart of the European project."" The foreign policy chief will have a seat as vice-president of the European Commission, as well as a budget worth billions of euros and a new diplomatic service of up to 5,000 people. For months Mr Blair had been a favourite for president, backed by the UK government, and he was the highest-profile candidate. Another contender, Dutch PM Jan-Peter Balkenende, ruled himself out of the contest as the meeting got under way. The EU leaders had a working dinner together to negotiate the appointments. Drives forward the work of EU Council of Ministers Represents the EU on the world stage They were reported to be striving for a balance in the two posts, with one filled by a candidate from one of the bigger EU states, the other from a smaller country. Similarly, the presidency was expected to go to a centre-right politician and the post of foreign affairs chief to the centre-left. The combination of Mr Van Rompuy and Baroness Ashton achieves that balance, the BBC's Jonny Dymond says. Mr Barroso said Mr Van Rompuy's appointment was ""a tribute to Belgium"", noting Belgium's key role as host of the EU's main institutions. The EU president will chair regular meetings of the European Council at which decisions are taken about the political position of the bloc. However, correspondents say the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, as the post is officially known, could have an even more powerful role.

875,"Nothe Fort in Weymouth is a monument to a time when military sea defence was an important part of life not only for Weymouth and Portland, but was considered a priority for the whole country.  Fearing an attack from the French, Prime Minister Palmerston endorsed an 1860 report that recommended building a series of sea defences in strategic positions around the UK coast.  But by the time Nothe Fort was completed in 1872, the threat from the French had long passed and the fort's firepower had been superceded – resulting in Nothe Fort, and the other forts that had been built as part of the plans, becoming known as Palmerston's Follies – said to be the most expensive programme of fixed defence ever built in peacetime.  During World War II, the fort had an anti-aircraft gun stationed inside it, but its main role was storing anti-aircraft ammunition for the south west.  The fort remained in service until 1956, and Weymouth and Portland Borough Council took over responsibility in 1961.  Abandoned, the building fell into disrepair at the hands of trespassers and squatters, but its prime location and spectacular views of Weymouth seafront and Portland ensured it was never totally forgotten.  But since the building's takeover by the Weymouth Civic Society, the fort, since 1980, has slowly been restored to its former glory, plus a military museum, and is one of Weymouth's most popular tourist attractions with up to 45,000 visitors a year.  David Joy, Director of Nothe Fort, says: ""It's a very important building and it's a part of our heritage. It was built to defend this part of the coast and it's a monument to the endeavours of the Victorian engineers.  ""It shows their brilliance in construction - thousands of tonnes of rock were brought in and a lot of it was put in place by hand - it's a testament to their ingenuity.""  And as well as a reminder of Dorset's contribution to military history, the fort is also developing a new community-based role, staging plays by local theatre groups in the central courtyard.  The fort is run by a team of five paid staff members and a dedicated team of 70 volunteers.  Says Brian: ""Lots of work has been done on the fort and there's great comradeship between all of the volunteers.""  Anyone interested in volunteering at the fort can contact Director David Joy.  David says: ""We're always on the look out for volunteers. We couldn't run the fort without them. There's always a role for someone to play here, whatever your skills may be."""
876,"The judgement clears the way for prosecutions of officials suspected of human rights abuses during military rule between 1976 and 1983.  President Nestor Kirchner, who called the amnesties ""shameful"", said the ruling restored faith in the judiciary.  Civil liberties groups say about 30,000 people were killed or went missing under the former dictatorship.  The Supreme Court upheld a decision by the Argentine Congress in August 2003 to scrap the amnesty laws.  The court voted by seven to one, with one abstention, to strike down two amnesty laws which had been in effect since 1986.  The campaign ended with the country's return to civilian rule in October 1983.  President Kirchner said: ""The court's decision has restored our faith in justice. This is a blast of fresh air that signifies the end of impunity.""  About 3,000 military officers - about 300 of whom still serve in the armed forces - could be accused, the Associated Press news agency reported.  Ahead of the ruling, Argentine Defence Minister Jose Pampuro said some officers were anxious pending the outcome.  ""In a personal capacity, some men who might be involved in some situation are expressing worry,"" he was quoted by AP as saying.  The Supreme Court ruling came in the case of former police officer Julio Simon, accused in the disappearance of a couple and of having taken their daughter as his own.  Under Argentine law, the decision will act as a precedent in other cases involving the Dirty War."

878,"It is from here that Rahul Gandhi makes his political debut, the constituency which elected his father, Rajiv, to parliament.  An hour away is the larger town of Rae Bareilly, which Rajiv's widow, Sonia, is contesting.  The news that two Gandhi family members have decided to stand in these two seats has delighted local residents.  ""We can never forget what the Gandhi family has done for Rae Bareilly,"" says Bharat Lal Yadav, who owns a restaurant on the main road leading into the town in Uttar Pradesh state.  ""After they stopped contesting, we have been forgotten. But now we are looking forward to backing one of them again.""  But it is the decision to field Rahul Gandhi that has really excited people in Amethi, 80km (50 miles) down the road.  ""We were really hoping that Rahul would contest from Amethi,"" says Rajendra Prasad as he scans the local newspaper.  ""It is the age of the youth - time for the younger generation to lead the way,"" he explains as he sips milky tea from a stained glass.  ""The Gandhis are the only ones who motivate the people of this town to rise above caste and religious lines,"" he says as everyone in the teashop nods in agreement.  ""Look at us here - a cross-section of voters with upper and lower-caste Hindus and a Muslim. We will all support them.""  Amethi has a long association with the Gandhi family, with Indira Gandhi's second son, Sanjay, first contesting from here in 1980.  When he died in a plane crash, his brother, Rajiv, was voted in from Amethi during a by-election.  ""It was then that the children, Rahul and Priyanka, began making visits to the constituency along with their mother, Sonia,"" says Dharmendra Shukla, a local Congress Party official.  Mr Shukla escorted the Gandhi siblings during a visit in January, when they came on a trip to test the political waters.  ""They spent a lot of time asking us questions, checking the progress of projects that their mother had initiated and generally had a really good time.""  Amethi was represented in the outgoing parliament by Sonia Gandhi, who has now chosen to shift to the neighbouring constituency of Rae Bareilly.  As you drive through town the Gandhi presence is very evident.  The town's main college was set up by her husband Feroze, who was also elected from Rae Bareilly.  ""You could describe this as the Gandhi's pocket borough,"" says BP Singh, a retired government employee.  He explains that the town grew in prominence with its long association with the Gandhis.  ""In 1969 my house rent was five rupees,"" he said.  ""Now it is 2,500 rupees. If that is not a sign of our growth and prosperity, what is?"" he asks with a smile.  The family association is what brings the Gandhis back to these two constituencies in a state where the fortunes of their Congress Party is fast dwindling.  In the last elections, Congress won a mere 10 seats out of a total 80.  ""If anyone other than a Gandhi had stood from here, we would have thought of voting for someone else,"" says Ramesh Kumar, a tailor.  ""But now there is no question.""  This thinking is put in perspective by Ameeta Singh, who belongs to one of Amethi's most influential families and is herself a politician.  ""People here do not look at the Gandhis as mere politicians,"" she says.  ""There is a strong emotional bond between them. You cannot break it."""

880,"McFly are surfing on a wave of borrowed riffs, and quite right too  Just over 40 years ago, The Shadows first picked up their electric guitars. Soon after, The Beatles followed suit and the British band as we know it was born. Two guitars, one bass, one drummer, and the rest is pop-rock history.  And then in the late 90s, post-Britpop, the major labels unleashed their weapon of mass destruction: the vocal harmony group. Today, having churned out boy band after girl band after boy band to little avail, they needed something fresh to sell to the kids. And what did they come up with? Busted. A bunch of young guys that play guitar and bass in front of an oddly-anonymous drummer. Genius. But it's not exactly rock science, is it?  Enter McFly, with their debut album Room On The Third Floor. But where their mentors, Busted, have remoulded the fresh putty of American pop-punk into something that still sounds new, McFly's influences are ancient in comparison, making the end product sound rather retrospective.  But that's not to say it's a bad record.  Already home to two striking chart-toppers ('Five Colours in Her Hair' and 'Obviously'), 'Surfer Babe' could easily be a third. The unmistakable summertime blues of the Beach Boys' 'Fun Fun Fun' flows through the album's veins (see 'Saturday Night' and 'Down By The Lake') and to many youthful ears this will no doubt sound just as good as it did in the 60s.  Elsewhere, McFly resurrect that Chuck Berry riff for the intro to 'That Girl', adapt the bassline from 'Blister In The Sun' on 'Met This Girl', and, rather cheekily, use Madness' 'It Must Be Love' for their album-closer, 'Broccoli'.  Lyrically, Room On The Third Floor is a bit hit-and-miss. For every moment of cheeky adolescent innocence (""she's getting married and I'm in misery cos her fiancé's so much bigger than me"") there's a worn-out cliché that no amount of co-writing with James Busted could cover up (""when she walks in the room, my heart goes boom"").  For the time being, then, McFly are surfing on a wave of borrowed riffs, and quite right too; firstly, because that's how you get yourself noticed in today's pop market, and secondly, because the riffs they've borrowed are some of the best ever written.  Just remember boys, it's all fun fun fun until the label takes your T-Bird away."

It is believed the weapon jammed when one of the men placed a gun to the back of his head and tried to fire it.

883,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
884,"Gerry Conlon, who was wrongly convicted of the 1974 Guildford IRA pub bombing, has died aged 60 after an illness.  He was one of the Guildford Four, who spent 15 years in prison before their convictions were quashed in 1989.  Mr Conlon's family said his fight for justice had ""forced the world's closed eyes to be opened to injustice"".  His case was highlighted in the 1993 Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.  The Guildford Four were convicted amid the backdrop of an IRA bombing campaign targeting pubs in England.  High-profile attacks were carried out in Guildford, Woolwich and Birmingham in 1974.  Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson were jailed for life in 1975 for an attack on the Horse and Groom pub in Guildford which killed four soldiers and a civilian, as well as injuring scores more.  All those involved vigorously protested their innocence.  The Court of Appeal quashed their sentences in October 1989, amid doubts raised about the police evidence against them.  An investigation into the case by Avon and Somerset Police found serious flaws in the way Surrey Police handled the case - considered to be one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in Britain.  The perpetrators of the Guildford bomb attack have never been brought to justice.  When he emerged from court after his conviction was quashed, Mr Conlon said: ""I have been in prison for something I did not do. I am totally innocent.""  In 2009, he wrote about the emotional problems he endured as a result of his incarceration, revealing that he had suffered two breakdowns, and attempted suicide. He also developed an addiction to alcohol and drugs.  Mr Conlon died at his home in the Falls Road area of west Belfast after an illness.  In a statement issued through his lawyer Gareth Peirce, Mr Conlon's family said: ""He brought life, love, intelligence, wit and strength to our family through its darkest hours.  ""He helped us to survive what we were not meant to survive.  ""We recognise that what he achieved by fighting for justice for us had a far, far greater importance - it forced the world's closed eyes to be opened to injustice; it forced unimaginable wickedness to be acknowledged; we believe it changed the course of history.  ""We thank him for his life and we thank all his many friends for their love.""  After Mr Conlon was jailed for the pub bombing, seven people were arrested because of a family connection to him.  Among them was Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe, who was arrested while travelling to London from Belfast to help his son.  They became known, as the Maguire Seven and were convicted and jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited.  The sentences given the Maguire Seven were overturned by the Court of Appeal in June 1991.  Annie Maguire, who was one of the Maguire Seven, described Mr Conlon's death as ""very sad news"".  ""I am sad to hear he has died so young, and am sorry for his sisters,"" she said.  Paul Hill said: ""I think he suffered a great deal more than the other individuals involved, myself included, because Gerard could never have release of his father.  ""I always said that Gerard's father was continuously imprisoned in Gerard's mind.  ""Not only did he feel responsible (for his father's death in prison), but every time he looked at his mother, the late Sarah, I think he seen his father. That was Gerard's problem.""  SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell said Mr Conlon had been a ""close friend"".  ""Gerry had a strong sense of social justice and an uncompromising desire to right the wrongs that had been suffered by others,"" he said.  ""The miscarriage of justice that Gerry, his father and friends suffered was terrible and appalling.  ""He was a shining light in the search for truth and a tireless campaigner for justice.""  Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said: ""Gerry and his father Giuseppe were two of the most infamous examples of miscarriages of justice by the British political and judicial system.""  In 2005, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a public apology to the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven for the miscarriages of justice they had suffered."
885,"In 1997 Labour ended 18 years in the political wilderness in spectacular style.  The party returned to power with a parliamentary landslide, winning the biggest majority held by any government since 1935.  Tony Blair's New Labour had gained a staggering 179-seat overall majority in the Commons as the Conservatives were tossed aside by the voters.  The election also saw the Liberal Democrats put in a remarkable performance, more than doubling their number of MPs despite taking a reduced share of the vote compared with 1992.  In the election's aftermath, commentators speculated whether it was at all possible for the Conservatives to overturn such a huge majority in a single election."
886,"Singer Sir Cliff Richard will face no further action over allegations of historical sex abuse, prosecutors say.  The Crown Prosecution Service said it had decided there was ""insufficient evidence to prosecute"".  Sir Cliff said he was ""obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close"".  But he said his naming by the media, despite not being charged, meant he had been ""hung out like live bait"".  Four men claimed offences took place between 1958 and 1983, the CPS said.  It is understood that one of the complainants intends to use the Victims' Right to Review Scheme to appeal against the decision not to bring charges.  In a statement, Sir Cliff said: ""I have always maintained my innocence, co-operated fully with the investigation, and cannot understand why it has taken so long to get to this point.""  He criticised the ""high-profile fumbling of my case from day one"".  ""Other than in exceptional cases, people who are facing allegations should never be named publicly until charged,"" he said.  ""I was named before I was even interviewed and for me that was like being hung out like 'live bait'.  ""It is obvious that such strategies simply increase the risk of attracting spurious claims which not only tie up police resources and waste public funds, but they forever tarnish the reputations of innocent people.""  Sir Cliff Richard's anger, mixed with relief, seeps from every line of his 366-word statement. The phrase ""hung out like live bait"" stands out - and it's designed to.  Sir Cliff wants to stop the reputations of other people being tarnished by publicity about allegations that haven't crossed the threshold for a prosecution, let alone been proven.  Although it's not police practice to identify suspects who haven't been charged - unless there are exceptional circumstances - names occasionally leak out and journalists sometimes discover the details through other routes.  A statutory ban on naming would put a stop to that. But would it allow sex offenders to get away with their crimes?  The concern is that if they hadn't been named in the media at an early stage, thereby emboldening other victims to come forward, some recently convicted celebrities would have got away with it.  Last year an independent investigation concluded that South Yorkshire Police should not have released ""highly confidential"" information to the BBC about a planned search of Sir Cliff Richard's home.  BBC film crews, including one in a helicopter, filmed the raid in August 2014.  In a statement, South Yorkshire Police apologised ""wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused"" to Sir Cliff by the force's ""initial handling of the media interest"" in its investigation.  The investigation is estimated to have cost ""in the region of £800,000"" including staffing costs, the force added.  ""Non-recent allegations are, by their very nature, complex and difficult matters to investigate and can take a considerable amount of time,"" it said.  ""We appreciate that waiting for a conclusion will undoubtedly have caused additional distress. However, it is in the interests of justice to investigate such matters thoroughly.""  Prosecutors received the full evidence file from police on 10 May, and BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said that meant the CPS had made its decision ""quite quickly"".  But he said the CPS had been working alongside the police for many months and there would now be ""serious questions for the police about why this has taken so long"".  He also said there would be ""serious questions for the BBC in terms of its coverage"".  Commenting on the claims against Sir Cliff, our correspondent said this ""isn't necessarily the end of the matter"", as the CPS maintains it must ""keep every case under review"" and every complainant has the right to a review of a decision not to bring charges - as one has said he will.  Responding to questions about the BBC's coverage, a BBC spokesman said: ""We applied normal editorial judgements to a story that was covered widely by all media and have continued to report the investigation as it developed including the CPS's decision today - which is running prominently across our news output.""  Conservative MP David Davis said Sir Cliff's case was ""another high-profile arrest which resulted in no prosecution"".  ""It is time for a complete review of police procedures surrounding high-profile sex abuse cases, and the publicity surrounding these cases,"" he said.  ""Whilst it is important to protect victims and maximise the chances of a successful prosecution, this must not result in the gratuitous destruction of people's reputation.""  Broadcaster and campaigner Nick Ross agreed with Sir Cliff's comment that he was ""hung out like live bait"".  He said police faced an ""impossible dilemma"" trying to balance justice for victims with ""trying not to have a witch hunt against people, some of whom are celebrities"".  But he said police did not handle Sir Cliff's case correctly, both in terms of Sir Cliff's name being released and by taking ""so long"" over the investigation.  Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck said he had not expected the CPS to come to any other decision when it came to his friend.  Tarbuck was released without charge in 2014 after his arrest over allegations of historical child sex abuse.  He said: ""I have known this man since we were 19 years of age, that's a long time, and I knew him then as a nice fellow.  ""I can tell you so many things about him, he's a decent human being. And why keep him waiting all this long?"""

889,"Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has been confronted by angry residents in an area badly hit by flooding.  Farmers and MPs in the Somerset Levels have accused the government and the Environment Agency of failing to take action by dredging the rivers.  The agency has said increased dredging would not have prevented recent flooding.  Mr Paterson promised an action plan would be drawn up to provide a long-term solution.  The Environment Agency currently has 14 flood warnings in place, 10 of which are in south-west England, where more rain is forecast over the coming days.  An agency spokesman said: ""We're doing everything we can to pump water off the Somerset Levels as quickly as river and tide levels allow.  When Owen Paterson arrived, a chorus of shouts from angry, placard-waving residents rose just above the roar of the billions of gallons of water being pumped off the levels into the River Parrett, here near Moorland. They want government action and they wanted to show the environment secretary just how mad they are. After nearly a month underwater, many had lost money, all had lost patience. They seemed pleased he had come to see the vast waterscape for himself, but disappointed he hadn't brought his cheque book with him and only seemed focused on a long-term plan rather than dishing out any extra cash today. One woman who had reached the end of her tether told me her life had been ruined by the floods. Fighting back the tears, she said it was all too little too late.  ""We have brought in extra manpower and pumping equipment from around the country and have 65 pumps working around the clock. This is the single largest pumping operation ever undertaken in Somerset.""  But he added: ""Dredging is often not the best long term or economic solution and increased dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels would not have prevented the recent widespread flooding.""  As Mr Paterson visited the Somerset Levels - a wetland, which is one of the lowest and flattest areas of the country - local farmer Becky Riley said more should have been done sooner.  She asked: ""Why was this not done last year, when this happened last year? Why have we just had the pumps put in now, why?""  Mr Paterson said he wanted to see a ""concrete plan"" from ""all the interested parties"" - including the local authorities, the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Transport, the internal drainage boards and the Department for Communities and Local Government - to provide a long-term solution, submitted to him within the next six weeks.  The minister added the plan would ""almost certainly"" involve clearing the Parrett and Tone rivers, acknowledging that national guidelines on dredging did not apply in the area as so much of it is below sea level.  Mr Paterson said: ""I've come down here to see what can be done. It appears from what everyone's telling me that we do need to dredge these two rivers but also we need to do more to hold water back, way back in the hills.""  He said he understood the impact of flooding on the community, adding: ""It is absolutely shocking and horrifying to people's private lives, to their business lives, it is incredibly disruptive.""  Ian Liddell-Grainger, Tory MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset, said of the River Parrett: ""Once it's dredged we can then maintain it but the Environment Agency has to stop this mucking around and get on with it.""  He dismissed as ""pathetic"" the Environment Agency's claims that the rain would have overwhelmed the river system even if it had dredged the waterways.  ""It is an absolutely ridiculous excuse,"" he said. ""This never flooded to this level ever in living memory, and we've got people who have been here for a long time. If you look back into the mists of time you don't have this.""  It comes as the National Famers Union in the South West said the floods had left farmers in a state of ""utter despair"". and the Environment Agency said about 40 properties in the Somerset Levels had flooded.  Prime Minister David Cameron said he thought the Environment Agency had done ""excellent work"" helping communities deal with flooding.  But he added that it had to listen - and address - concerns over flooding.  BBC weather forecaster Susan Powell said frequent showers from 21:00 GMT through to midnight on Tuesday could bring up to 25mm (1in) of rain in parts of southern England, with a risk of up to 40mm (1.5in) of rain on higher ground in south-west England.  The Environment Agency said there was also ""a risk of groundwater flooding in Hampshire until Wednesday"" and that ""parts of Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, West Berkshire and Surrey may also experience localised groundwater flooding over the next five days"".  And the Met Office is warning that persistent rain will fall on to already saturated ground in northern and eastern areas of Scotland creating a risk of localised flooding.  Flood warnings in England are in place for parts of the Midlands, North East, South East and South West. are also more than 140 flood alerts - indicating flooding is possible - in places across England and Wales.  Parts of northern England and Scotland have seen snow, but so far there has been little travel disruption in the majority of the UK, although ferry crossings between Weymouth and the Channel Islands were cancelled due to adverse weather.  One sporting event hit by the weather was the racing at Plumpton, east Sussex, which was abandoned on Monday due to a waterlogged course."
890,"The Church of Christ The Redeemer is Lurgan's most recognizable landmark. This Church Of Ireland, gothic building is situated in Church Place, in the centre of Lurgan and can be seen miles away from the town. The original church was sited in Shankill Graveyard, which is half a mile from the present building. The old church became too small for the congregation and had fell into dilapidation.   So in the early 18th century a new church was built in ""The Green"" in Lurgan. The site of Shankill graveyard itself and the old church has historic importance dating to pre-christian times. It is also known that there was a Mediaeval church here which was probably destroyed in the ""Nine years War"" at the end of the 16th Century.  William Roulston explains that in the early 17th Century the land was granted to the Brownlow family, who founded Lurgan. They restored the church as a place of worship for the influx of English settlers during the plantation. The most dominant feature in the churchyard is the Brownlow Mausoleum where ""the most noble family of Abercorn"" are buried. Not surprisingly, the graveyard has changed several times and the earliest legible headstone today dates back to April 1690. Kieran Glendinning has written a considerable number of documents about this graveyard and he talks to Mary Ferris about the Brownlows and some of the other families who are buried here. He also tells the fascinating story of one Margorie McCall, a woman who's famed in these parts for having been buried twice! Mary spoke next to Mrs Greer. The Greers, who were formerly the McGregors, were proscribed in their native Scotland and settled in Cumbria. They came to Northern Ireland during the plantation - originally to Dungannon and Moy - and then to Lurgan in 1757 where they bought the family home at Woodville which still stands today. Mrs Greer who continues to live in the family home has plotted the family tree which is so complex she used a roll of wallpaper to write it on! She tells Mary Ferris of how her recent ancestors were involved in both Whiskey and Linen... Woolsey Gracey is the archivist at the Church of Ireland and has a great understanding of local history and heritage. The archived records go back to 1675. He shows us the minutes of a vestry meeting just after the first church on the site was built in 1725. Many of those whose signatures appear on the document are buried outside in the churchyard. One of them is Rev Arthur Ford who was rector in the parish for twenty years. He insisted in his will that he would be buried in the North end of the graveyard in a bid to dispel an old superstition that the Northern end was 'unholy ground' and only for paupers. Particularly interesting are the records Woolsey holds of the deaths and burials during the period of the famine, which was at its worst in 1847. Charles Brownlow, first Baron of Lurgan died of Typhus whilst helping the poor and needy of the town. John Neill, a member of the congregation is a solicitor for the firm which is responsible for the Brownlow estate. He tells how his recent ancestors raised funds to buy new bells for the church. Gerard McAtasney is the author of the book ""This dreadful visitation"" which recounts stories surrounding the famine in the Lurgan and Portadown area. He tells us how the Shankill graveyard had more burials than any other graveyard in Ireland at that time. Conditions in the workhouses were appalling and many new recruits were brought in and given clothing left behind by those who had died of disease. The survival rate was dismally low. The workhouse graveyard was bursting. Often there were 5 bodies to one coffin and up to 30 bodies to a grave. When it eventually overflowed, a 'paupers pit' was opened in the Shankill graveyard. These would have been unmarked graves. At the height of the famine there were 492 burials in Shankill which included 233 'workhouse burials', the worst workhouse death-rate in Ireland. Today no-one really knows whereabouts in the Shankill graveyard the workhouse bodies are buried."
891,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.

893,"They have filed corruption charges against first lady Wu Shu-chen and three former presidential aides over the alleged misuse of state funds.  President Chen has been undermined by a series of scandals involving his family and his office in recent months.  He has already survived two opposition attempts, including one last month, to remove him from office.  The ruling Democratic Progressive Party said it was meeting on Friday evening to discuss the latest developments.  The charges relate to the handling of a secret presidential fund used for diplomatic work overseas. Officials say around US$500,000 could not be properly accounted for.  During the four-month investigation, officials looked at six separate cases involving the use of the fund. They said the president's explanation for two were verified, but three were questionable and one was described as pure fiction.  The Public Prosecutor's Office of the Taiwan High Court announced on Friday it was filing charges of embezzlement and forgery of documents against Wu Shu-chen.  ""Prosecutors found that Wu and three other suspects jointly claimed 14.8m Taiwan dollars (US$448,484) with false receipts... between July 2002 and March 2006,"" Chang Wen-cheng, of the prosecutor's office, said.  The first lady has previously denied any wrongdoing.  ""Evidence also showed Chen is suspected of graft and forgery... but since he is protected by constitution against criminal charges, he can only be prosecuted after he leaves office,"" Mr Chang said.  Ma Ying-jeou, of the opposition Nationalist Party, said Mr Chen must resign as soon as possible.  ""He has lost the people's trust and respect, and as he is burdened with scandals, he can no longer lead the people nor effectively represent the country,"" he said.  There was no immediate comment from the presidential office.  President Chen has been facing growing calls for his resignation in recent months over the scandals to hit his family and office.  Last month, Wu Shu-chen was cleared of accepting vouchers from a department store in return for her influence.  In May, her son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, was arrested and later charged with insider trading.  Mr Chen, whose term of office is due to run until 2008, has apologised for the scandals and did cede some powers to Prime Minister Su Tseng-chang in June to placate his critics, but has refused to resign.  The scandals have brought tens of thousands of people - both supporters and opponents of the president - out on to the streets to voice their views."

896,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
897,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

899,"For Sir Alex Ferguson, it is the most critical week of the season so far.  Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday followed by the return leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich. And all to be negotiated without Wayne Rooney.  Away from events on the pitch, the even more important battle for the future ownership of the club is also reaching a critical point.  Despite last week's announcement from the Red Knights that there would be no takeover bid until the end of the season, the campaign to wrest control from the Glazer family gathers momentum.  A Manchester United supporter wears a scarf in the colours of the anti-Glazer movement. Credit: AP  Earlier this week, leading Knights figures held a key strategy meeting to discuss the final structure of the bid being drawn up by Japanese investment bank Nomura and City lawyers Freshfields. According to well-placed sources, the favoured option is now for a £1.2bn bid working in two phases.  Having decided to retain the £500m bond recently used to refinance the Glazers' debts, the Knights are discussing a plan whereby two thirds of the remaining £700m would be raised from 30-40 super rich United supporters. The final third would come from fundraising among ordinary fans. If necessary, the Knights say they will borrow money to complete the bid.  In phase two - once the club was secured - a general share offer would be launched allowing supporters the chance to own a stake in their club.  Once this structure is agreed, Nomura will begin the process - perhaps as early as next week - of asking the 30 or 40 wealthy Knights to commit their cash.  So far, we only know the names of four of the Knights. They are Jim O'Neill, a lifelong United supporter and head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, Paul Marshall from hedge fund Marshall Wace, Mark Rawlinson from Freshfields and Guy Dawson from Nomura.  All four have major City reputations and, perhaps more importantly, serious United credentials. In the case of O'Neill, he was on the United PLC board at the time of the Glazer takeover in 2005 and is close friends with Ferguson and chief executive David Gill.  But, even if this wealthy group of United fans can raise the money, would the Glazers sell?  Despite rumours of financial problems at home, the American family have insisted publicly they are in it for the long run. They have to say that.  But privately, too, they have been sending the same message to the Knights. Investment bank Rothschild, which advised the Glazers on their £800m takeover, has not been retained at this stage but it is understood it has made informal contact with the Knights in the last few weeks to tell them they are wasting their time.  Besides, as the club points out, United under the Glazers are hardly a disaster story. Since the takeover, Sir Alex's side have won the Champions League and three Premier League titles. They have increased commercial income by 65% and have, to date, only taken out £23m, although it is worth noting the bond issue allows them to take out many millions more in the future.  So the key questions are these:  Can the fans actually raise the money to persuade the Glazers to sell?  Until we see the colour of the Knights' money, this is impossible to predict but the sums involved would make it very difficult for ordinary fans to do it on their own.  A recent survey suggested 83% of United fans would be prepared to put an average of £600 towards the takeover. With 150,000 supporters now signed up to the Manchester United Supporters Trust that would amount to just £90m - 7.5% of what is required. That is not insignificant but fans would need to be prepared to put in thousands and thousands of pounds - not hundreds.  Even if the Knights were successful, what would actually change?  If it is accepted United are doing well on the pitch - in spite of Cristiano Ronaldo's sale to Real Madrid - and the club is making more money than ever, the touchstone issue is the £716m of debt the Glazers have saddled the club with.  But the Knights say they will keep the £500m bond. The interest payments currently draining out of the club at around £60m a year will not stop. And the longer-term problems - replacing Ferguson and rebuilding an ageing squad - will need even more money to solve.  Will the wealthy Knights just hand over the club to fans?  Rich men do not become rich through philanthropy. They will expect a return. The challenge for O'Neill and the Knights is persuading multi-millionaires to put their fortunes into the club and then allow their shares to be sold on to supporters for little if any profit. Is there not a danger that United could simply be swapping one group of wealthy owners for another?  For now, most United fans will worry only about results on the pitch - and with their team still in the hunt for a remarkable domestic and European double, they will leave the Knights to their plotting.  The crunch point will come when it becomes clear where the £80m United received for selling Ronaldo to Real has gone. Quarterly results - one of the requirements of the bond issue - due to be published on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange before the end of the month will show that the money is still sitting in the bank.  But if, as everyone suspects, it is eventually used to start paying down the Glazer's £202m of PIK (payment in kind) loans and not for strengthening Ferguson's team in the summer, then that's the point when things could really start to get interesting"

902,"At its simplest, journalism is about telling people things they don't know. So when the Ministry of Defence approached the BBC - along with other parts of the UK media - to ask us not to tell our audiences about a possible deployment of Prince Harry to Afghanistan, it was something we thought long and hard about.  A news black-out is unusual, but not unique. An agreement exists between the police and the media over the reporting of kidnaps - the police have the right to request that media organisations don't report an abduction while negotiations are under way, in case it makes the release of the hostage more difficult; in return, they accept the responsibility to update the media regularly and reveal the full story, on camera, once the situation has been resolved. When lives are at risk, it's not always helpful to have things played out in the glare of publicity.  Last summer - on the day my colleague Alan Johnston was released in Gaza - the Chief of the General Staff, Sir Richard Dannatt, met editors to make the case for a voluntary agreement. He was very candid; Harry wanted a career in the Army and he needed to be able to be deployed to do what he'd been trained to do, even if it was just for a day.  After five months of discussions, using the kidnap agreement as our model, the MoD and the UK media reached an understanding; we wouldn't speculate or report on the prince's deployments to minimise the danger to him and to others. In return, we'd get access to him before, during and after his time in Afghanistan. It was a voluntary agreement - any of the organisations could have decided to leave at any time. We - and the other UK broadcasters and newspapers - were clear that we would not report his deployment.  So, for the past ten weeks, the BBC, ITV and Sky News have been filming with Prince Harry - the first time we've been up close and personal with him. We interviewed him at Clarence House in mid-December, just before he was sent to Afghanistan, we spent some time with him at the start of January when he was settling in at a remote base in Southern Helmand Province, and most recently, we filmed with him last week at a new location in Helmand Province.  In truth, the surprise is that the agreement lasted so long. We - and the other UK broadcasters - were clear that we would not report his deployment. But nor would we deceive our audiences.  On Christmas Day, when neither Prince William nor Prince Harry attended the regular service with other members of the Royal Family at Sandringham, we agreed with the Ministry of Defence that they would say that both princes were spending Christmas with their regiments - William volunteered for Christmas duty to help out his brother! It prompted some inquiries from one US TV network who had to be briefed on the story.  More recently, on Tuesday, the German newspaper Bild ran a diary story asking ""where's Prince Harry?"" and speculating that the gossip was that ""he'd gone to war"". We agreed that while the story was speculative and confined to diary pages, that we would not break the agreement we'd reached with the MoD.  Then yesterday, the Drudge Report - the online US website famous for breaking the story of Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky - put the story on its front page. The game was up. We, and the other broadcasters, agreed with the Ministry of Defence that the story was out and it would be wrong not to tell our audiences what had been going on.  We don't do this stuff lightly - there are no other ""voluntary agreements"" in place at the moment, there's nothing else we're not telling you. Until yesterday, only a handful of people in the BBC knew about the story - trust me, keeping secrets from other journalists is hard work! Our job normally is to make these things public, not keep them from you. But this was never just about Prince Harry's safety, it was also about the security of the soldiers serving with him. No editor wants to be responsible for increasing the risk they already face from the Taleban. Nor do I think our audiences would have thanked us for doing so.  "

904,"The UK economy has returned to recession, after shrinking by 0.2% in the first three months of 2012.  A sharp fall in construction output was behind the surprise contraction, the Office for National Statistics said.  A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2011.  BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders says it ""adds to the picture that the economy is bumping along the bottom"".  She said economic output was slightly smaller now than it was in the autumn of 2010.  Wednesday's figure is an early estimate and is subject to at least two further revisions in the coming months. It is compiled using 40% of the data gathered for later revisions.  The UK economy was last in recession in 2009.  Prime Minister David Cameron said the figures were ""very, very disappointing"".  ""I don't seek to excuse them, I don't seek to try to explain them away,"" he said at Prime Minister's Questions.  ""There is no complacency at all in this government in dealing with what is a very tough situation, which frankly has just got tougher.""  He said it was ""painstaking, difficult"" work, but the government would stick with its plans and do ""everything we can"" to generate growth.  Labour leader Ed Miliband said the figures were ""catastrophic"" and asked Mr Cameron what his excuse was.  ""This is a recession made by him and the chancellor in Downing Street. It is his catastrophic economic policy that has landed us back in recession,"" Mr Miliband said.  The ONS said output of the production industries decreased by 0.4%, construction decreased by 3%. Output of the services sector, which includes retail, increased by 0.1%, after falling a month earlier.  These figures are slightly worse than many expected, but the fact that the UK is now technically back in recession should not detract from the underlying reality, which is very much as predicted. The UK economy has been bumping along the bottom for more than a year and is still struggling to gain momentum. Many have questioned the dire numbers for the construction sector, which accounts for less than 7% of the economy, but has done much to pull the GDP figure into negative territory. The sharp fall in output from the production sector is also at odds with recent business surveys (though manufacturing has not fallen as the sector overall). However, this preliminary figure is consistent with the message coming from official and private data - that the UK was once again relying heavily on services and consumption by households. That suggests the recovery will continue to be weak, though whether we will see further quarters of negative growth is very much an open question.  It added that a fall in government spending had contributed to the particularly large fall in the construction sector.  ""The huge cuts to public spending - 25% in public sector housing and 24% in public non-housing and with a further 10% cuts to both anticipated for 2013 - have left a hole too big for other sectors to fill,"" said Judy Lowe, deputy chairman of industry body CITB-ConstructionSkills, said.  Some have questioned the validity of the ONS's figures, particularly on the construction industry, which has been particularly volatile in recent quarters.  But Joe Grice, chief economic adviser to the ONS, said the construction data was based on a survey of 8,000 companies and had been carefully checked and double checked.  The latest figures supported the view that the economy had been ""flattish"" in the past few quarters, he added.  Over the last year and a half, the economy has fluctuated between quarters of growth and contraction.  Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King has previously warned that the economy will continue to ""zig zag"" this year.  He had forecast growth in the first quarter but then a contraction in the second quarter, when the extra bank holiday for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee is expected to reduce output.  ""It is clearly not good news, the missing link in the economy has been confidence,"" said Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors told BBC News.  ""These are relatively small falls, so we shouldn't be too alarmist.  ""[But] regardless of the figures, it is the message that comes out to business - to be cautious - exactly when we want them to be a little more aggressive in terms of recruitment and investment.""  However, some pointed to other recent business surveys, which painted a more positive picture of the economy.  ""These figures are at odds with the experiences of many UK businesses, which continue to operate with guarded optimism,"" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.  He added that he expected the preliminary estimate to be revised upwards when more information became available.  The estimate for construction output is based on published data for the first two months of the quarter, and an estimation for the third month.  But the ONS pointed out that, while there was ""a tendency for upward revisions"" to construction, March would need to be ""exceptionally strong"" in the construction sector to produce growth in the quarter.  The first estimate of GDP for the last three months of 2011 showed a contraction of 0.2%, which was later revised to a contraction of 0.3%."

A taxi driver, he had been detained on suspicion of attempted rape. The police interrogation was so relentless, he says, that it brought him to the brink of suicide. ""When I first started saying I was innocent the intimidation and the pressure on me grew stronger,"" he said. ""They kept saying, 'Your family is giving up on you, they're very disappointed in you.' They kept repeating over and over. Mr Yanagihara spent two years in jail for a crime he was later cleared of ""I got to the stage of there's really nothing I can do about this. Anything I say they're not going to listen to, there's nothing I can do. I just said yes, one word yes. That led them to arrest me."" That confession was enough to see Hiroshi Yanagihara convicted and spend more than two years behind bars, even though a footprint at the scene did not match his shoe size. He was only cleared after he was released, when another man was found guilty of the crime. His is one of several high-profile cases of forced confessions in Japan. Amnesty International has now called on Japan's new government to immediately implement reforms of the police interrogation system to avoid such miscarriages of justice. Suspects can be held for up to 23 days before they are charged in what the campaign group says is a brutal system that has no place in modern Japan. The conviction rate is more than 99%, often based on confessions. Amnesty International says some are extracted from suspects under duress. In its manifesto the Democratic Party, which won a general election in August, pledged to introduce full videotaping of interrogations. Japan's courts have a conviction rate of more than 99% - although it cannot be compared directly to other countries because there is no plea bargaining. At the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did?    Prosecutors usually proceed with a case only if they are sure they will win and a confession has been called the king of evidence. ""The detainee has absolutely no access to his defence lawyers, has no idea how long the interrogation session would go,"" said Rajiv Narayan of Amnesty International. ""And this also involves many, many hours of repeated questions and sometimes sleep deprivation, and where the detainee is given the impression he would only be released once he confesses. ""In that kind of system, what's of great concern is the confessions extracted could even be used to sentence a person to death."" Amnesty International says it is impossible to know how many miscarriages of justice there have been. A British man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC about his experience of police detention in Japan. ""The first thing I was told, and this was by the officers, was you're going to hell with your eyes open,"" he said. The man had been caught trying to smuggle two kilograms of cannabis into Japan. He admits his guilt, but claims he was interrogated for up to 16 hours a day for weeks on end as officers tried to get him to confess to further crimes. He says he was handcuffed, tied with a rope to his chair and not allowed to use the toilet. Every day he was presented with papers in Japanese, which he did not understand, and told to sign them. Each time he refused, he says, things got worse. ""He says to me, 'Just co-operate and you'll find things will be just co-operate with him',"" the man said. ""He wanted me to agree that I'd brought marijuana to Japan before, I'm in a gang. They started shouting at me. They tried to force me to sign the papers. They put one inmate in my cell and he started to do all the kung fu like he was going to attack me."" The police and the Ministry of Justice were unable to respond to these particular allegations because the charity representing the prisoner wants to maintain his anonymity with a view to future compensation. However, they were prepared to discuss the case of Hiroshi Yanagihara, wrongly convicted of attempted rape. ""Regarding this case the prosecutor's office investigated the problems in August 2007 to prevent it happening again,"" said Ministry of Justice spokesman Yoshio Nakamura. ""They released the report. And we believe the report will be used in order to prevent it from happening again."" Trial by jury has just been introduced in Japan, and campaigners hope it will cast light on the justice system. But Amnesty International says this is not enough. They are calling on Japan's new government to immediately fulfil an election pledge to videotape interrogations to stop abuses in police detention. There is no commitment to reduce the length of time suspects can be held by police. ""Wrongful convictions should not happen, and I hope they won't in the future,"" said Keiko Chiba, the new minister of justice. ""People in the justice system and politicians knew there was a problem and were concerned. ""But at the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did? And they thought there's no way the investigators would do such a thing. That's why it didn't come to changing it as much as it should have done.""     "

African music in general first came to international attention in the 1950s with the popularity of ""kwela"" in the urban townships of Johannesburg. Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other    South Africa claims kwela for its own, but Kenny Gilmore, the director of a documentary that charts the history of Malawian music, says kwela was actually popularised in South Africa by Malawian musicians. ""The founding fathers of kwela kwela, a lot, not all of them, were Malawian, Malawi's never been that famous so nobody hears about them,"" he told the BBC World Service. ""Then they take a holiday down to South Africa, play some music, then, boom, the kwela kwela revolution [happens] and everybody thinks its South African."" Even a capella made famous by groups like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and more contemporary styles like Afro-jazz, both owe much of their distinct style to Malawian musicians according to Mr Gilmore. Malawi has nine tribal and linguistic groups, each possessing its own traditional dances and indigenous rhythms. ""True African music all comes from a traditional dance somewhere... and Malawi has got unique dances with unique rhythms,"" he says. He cites dances such as the Chewa's masked ""Gule Wamkulu"" (the big dance); the Ngoni's ""Ingoma"" war dance; the Beni military dance; and the healing ""Vimbuza"" spirit dance of the Tumbuka. But sadly only a handful of these were recorded in the 1940s and 1950s. Inspired by the late musical archivist Alan Lomax's famous journey to collect early blues recordings in the deep American South, for six weeks last year Mr Gilmore and his team travelled to villages across Malawi hoping to document and record some of this musical heritage, both past and present. He hoped to record as much as possible of what is left of these traditions before the memories and the music are gone forever. ""Outside Malawi you never hear the words 'music' and 'Malawi' next to each other. I went to Cape Town record shops, nothing, London, nothing, America, New York, nothing. These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms... we've got a unique musical melting pot    ""I'm on a mission to change it, I think the world needs to hear music and Malawi in the same sentence."" Using a portable studio, musicians from Malawi's most rural and remote areas were given the opportunity to record, promote and preserve their musical heritage. What the team got was a mix of individual musicians, small groups and cultural dance troupes, some of it purely traditional, some of it more of a fusion of traditional with contemporary and jazz influences. ""Sometimes you get these places in the world when you get these really interesting melting pots of cultures,"" says Mr Gilmore. ""You have the Congolese influence just above Malawi, you've got the Zambian influence to the west, you've got Zimbabwe to the east and you've got South Africa to the south. ""These country boundaries actually mean nothing in cultural terms - so all these great influences come into Malawi, mixing - we've got a unique musical melting pot."" Well-known Malawian musician and politician Lucius Banda says what makes Malawi music so special and deserving of greater interest is the way it has absorbed other influences into its musical traditions, making them their own. ""Malawi music is different, the special thing about Malawi music is [that it is] so cultural,"" he says. ""South Africa has disco and other Western influences. But Malawian music is quite unique in its own perspective."" One such influence which dramatically influenced the country's musical style was the banjo. The banjo was brought back to Malawi by soldiers who had served in East and Western African battalions during WWII. The banjo and blue grass influences were infused with traditional beats and dominated the country's music for nearly 20 years. In the 1970s jazz made an appearance in Malawi, then in more recent times has come gospel, reggae and pop influences. But what is most special about Malawi music according to Mr Gilmore is not the way it has fused the traditional with the contemporary - it is its energy and passion. ""I've played round the world and most of the times you get the beginning and it's warming up, people not getting too excited, then there's a kind of warm phase. ""In Malawi, from the first song boom, the whole club just kind of ignites in a fire bomb and it carries on until the last. ""The bartenders have left the bar, security have left the gate, someone's climbed over the fence you can see the whole nearby village dancing next to the gate, ""It's just a massive riotous party and it just leaves me filled with so much happiness.""

907,"Jacob Zuma's advisers say he has nothing to hide South Africa's opposition leader has called for an investigation into whether President Jacob Zuma has broken the government's strict ethics code. This says all members of the cabinet must declare their financial interests within 60 days of taking office. He has not done so nine months after his inauguration - his spokesman said there was a difference of opinion. But the president is now compiling the list in case legal advice says he should declare his interests. ""Mr Zuma is not hiding anything,"" his spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told local media. His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government    But opposition Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille retorted: ""If he had nothing to hide... he would simply declare his interests and the presidency would not be doing legal somersaults to find a reason for him not to declare."" The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Zuma seems to be buckling under the mounting pressure. Local media reported at the weekend that Mr Zuma has not declared his business dealings, leading to renewed calls from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, Cosatu - a partner of the ANC in government. ""We believe that you cannot be a people's champion during the day but at night you count shares that have been obtained through exploitation,"" said the union's General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, the Sapa news agency reports. The DA says Mr Zuma's apparent lack of transparency had cast a shadow on his intentions to end corruption in government and uphold the constitution. Ms Zille wants the Public Protector to investigate whether Mr Zuma had violated the Code of Conduct by his actions and warns the delay may cause mistrust. ""His failure to declare demonstrates the level of contempt this president has for transparency in government,"" said party MP Athol Trollip. ""President Zuma needs to stop trying to bend the law to suit his interests. President Mbeki declared his interests. The law is absolutely explicit that a president must declare his interests."" Mr Zuma is the latest to be called upon to reveal his interests, after he recently rejected calls from Cosatu for government ministers and politicians to undergo a ""lifestyle audit"" to ensure they are not living beyond their stated means. Our reporter says this decision may now be closely scrutinised. Mr Zuma's attorney Michael Hulley, who also handled his rape trial, is currently handling the matter - the list will include records of the interests of his three wives and 20 children.     "

About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.

In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.

911,"The UK economy has returned to recession, after shrinking by 0.2% in the first three months of 2012.  A sharp fall in construction output was behind the surprise contraction, the Office for National Statistics said.  A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2011.  BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders says it ""adds to the picture that the economy is bumping along the bottom"".  She said economic output was slightly smaller now than it was in the autumn of 2010.  Wednesday's figure is an early estimate and is subject to at least two further revisions in the coming months. It is compiled using 40% of the data gathered for later revisions.  The UK economy was last in recession in 2009.  Prime Minister David Cameron said the figures were ""very, very disappointing"".  ""I don't seek to excuse them, I don't seek to try to explain them away,"" he said at Prime Minister's Questions.  ""There is no complacency at all in this government in dealing with what is a very tough situation, which frankly has just got tougher.""  He said it was ""painstaking, difficult"" work, but the government would stick with its plans and do ""everything we can"" to generate growth.

912,"Mr Van Rompuy was widely tipped, but Baroness Ashton was not EU leaders have chosen the Belgian Prime Minister, Herman van Rompuy, to be the first permanent European Council President. The other top job created by the Lisbon Treaty - foreign affairs supremo - has gone to the EU Trade Commissioner, Baroness Catherine Ashton from the UK. Both are seen as consensual politicians with limited foreign policy experience. Both had unanimous backing from the 27 EU leaders at the summit in Brussels, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Earlier, the UK government had said it was no longer pushing for former PM Tony Blair to get the presidency post. Mr Van Rompuy, 62, had crucial French and German support. He has a reputation as a coalition builder, having taken charge of the linguistically divided Belgian government and steered it out of a crisis. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations,"" he told a news conference after his appointment. ""Even if unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth,"" he said, stressing the individuality of EU member states. Baroness Ashton, 53, said she felt ""deeply privileged"" to get the foreign affairs post. ""I was the first woman British commissioner, the first woman trade commissioner, so I am also proud to be the first woman High Representative,"" she said. ""I think there was a strong push to have at least one woman in a senior position,"" she told the BBC later, adding that she hoped Europe would become ""an economic superpower"". US President Barack Obama said the appointments would ""strengthen the EU and enable it to be an even stronger partner to the United States"". ""The United States has no stronger partner than Europe in advancing security and prosperity around the world,"" the White House said in a statement. Earlier, a UK government spokesman revealed the dramatic twist in the British position. Against all expectations this deal was done in a matter of hours, the pre-summit deadlock broken by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His decision to abandon Tony Blair's bid for the new post of President of the European Council meant the field was left clear for the Belgian prime minister, Herman van Rompuy. It also meant that he could bag for a Briton the second job of the night - one arguably more important and probably higher-profile - that of High Representative, something close to a foreign minister for Europe. Neither Mr Van Rompuy nor Baroness Ashton are what might be called big-hitters. Their selection indicates a preference for a low-key start to these new jobs.    The UK persuaded the other six leaders in the socialist group to back Baroness Ashton, having dropped Tony Blair. EU leaders met in Brussels especially to select their first full-time president and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs - new posts created by the Lisbon Treaty, which will come into force on 1 December. The idea under Lisbon is to give the EU more coherence and continuity in key policy areas. Up until now the presidency has been held by member states in turn, on a six-month rotation. Going into the meeting the leaders had various candidates to choose from. There were fears that the negotiations would go on late into the night, but it quickly emerged that a deal had been struck. Mr Brown praised Mr Van Rompuy as ""a consensus builder"" who had ""brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty"". Turning to Baroness Ashton's appointment, he said ""it gives Britain a powerful voice within the Council and the [EU] Commission. He is camera-shy, a man who some refer to as the ""grey mouse""    ""It will ensure that Britain's voice is very loud and clear. It will ensure that Britain remains at the heart of Europe."" Baroness Ashton ""is the first woman to hold such a high position in the EU,"" he added. Commenting on the choice, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: ""It's so important that Britain remains at the heart of the European project."" The foreign policy chief will have a seat as vice-president of the European Commission, as well as a budget worth billions of euros and a new diplomatic service of up to 5,000 people. For months Mr Blair had been a favourite for president, backed by the UK government, and he was the highest-profile candidate. Another contender, Dutch PM Jan-Peter Balkenende, ruled himself out of the contest as the meeting got under way. The EU leaders had a working dinner together to negotiate the appointments. Drives forward the work of EU Council of Ministers Represents the EU on the world stage They were reported to be striving for a balance in the two posts, with one filled by a candidate from one of the bigger EU states, the other from a smaller country. Similarly, the presidency was expected to go to a centre-right politician and the post of foreign affairs chief to the centre-left. The combination of Mr Van Rompuy and Baroness Ashton achieves that balance, the BBC's Jonny Dymond says. Mr Barroso said Mr Van Rompuy's appointment was ""a tribute to Belgium"", noting Belgium's key role as host of the EU's main institutions. The EU president will chair regular meetings of the European Council at which decisions are taken about the political position of the bloc.

913,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.

918,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Hiroshi Yanagihara cannot forget the day he was forced to confess to a crime he did not commit. A taxi driver, he had been detained on suspicion of attempted rape. The police interrogation was so relentless, he says, that it brought him to the brink of suicide. ""When I first started saying I was innocent the intimidation and the pressure on me grew stronger,"" he said. ""They kept saying, 'Your family is giving up on you, they're very disappointed in you.' They kept repeating over and over. Mr Yanagihara spent two years in jail for a crime he was later cleared of ""I got to the stage of there's really nothing I can do about this. Anything I say they're not going to listen to, there's nothing I can do. I just said yes, one word yes. That led them to arrest me."" That confession was enough to see Hiroshi Yanagihara convicted and spend more than two years behind bars, even though a footprint at the scene did not match his shoe size. He was only cleared after he was released, when another man was found guilty of the crime. His is one of several high-profile cases of forced confessions in Japan. Amnesty International has now called on Japan's new government to immediately implement reforms of the police interrogation system to avoid such miscarriages of justice. Suspects can be held for up to 23 days before they are charged in what the campaign group says is a brutal system that has no place in modern Japan. The conviction rate is more than 99%, often based on confessions. Amnesty International says some are extracted from suspects under duress. In its manifesto the Democratic Party, which won a general election in August, pledged to introduce full videotaping of interrogations. Japan's courts have a conviction rate of more than 99% - although it cannot be compared directly to other countries because there is no plea bargaining. At the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did?    Prosecutors usually proceed with a case only if they are sure they will win and a confession has been called the king of evidence. ""The detainee has absolutely no access to his defence lawyers, has no idea how long the interrogation session would go,"" said Rajiv Narayan of Amnesty International. ""And this also involves many, many hours of repeated questions and sometimes sleep deprivation, and where the detainee is given the impression he would only be released once he confesses. ""In that kind of system, what's of great concern is the confessions extracted could even be used to sentence a person to death."" Amnesty International says it is impossible to know how many miscarriages of justice there have been. A British man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC about his experience of police detention in Japan. ""The first thing I was told, and this was by the officers, was you're going to hell with your eyes open,"" he said. The man had been caught trying to smuggle two kilograms of cannabis into Japan. He admits his guilt, but claims he was interrogated for up to 16 hours a day for weeks on end as officers tried to get him to confess to further crimes. He says he was handcuffed, tied with a rope to his chair and not allowed to use the toilet. Every day he was presented with papers in Japanese, which he did not understand, and told to sign them. Each time he refused, he says, things got worse. ""He says to me, 'Just co-operate and you'll find things will be just co-operate with him',"" the man said. ""He wanted me to agree that I'd brought marijuana to Japan before, I'm in a gang. They started shouting at me. They tried to force me to sign the papers. They put one inmate in my cell and he started to do all the kung fu like he was going to attack me."" The police and the Ministry of Justice were unable to respond to these particular allegations because the charity representing the prisoner wants to maintain his anonymity with a view to future compensation. However, they were prepared to discuss the case of Hiroshi Yanagihara, wrongly convicted of attempted rape. ""Regarding this case the prosecutor's office investigated the problems in August 2007 to prevent it happening again,"" said Ministry of Justice spokesman Yoshio Nakamura. ""They released the report. And we believe the report will be used in order to prevent it from happening again."" Trial by jury has just been introduced in Japan, and campaigners hope it will cast light on the justice system. But Amnesty International says this is not enough. They are calling on Japan's new government to immediately fulfil an election pledge to videotape interrogations to stop abuses in police detention. There is no commitment to reduce the length of time suspects can be held by police. ""Wrongful convictions should not happen, and I hope they won't in the future,"" said Keiko Chiba, the new minister of justice. ""People in the justice system and politicians knew there was a problem and were concerned. ""But at the same time a lot of people would say if you didn't do it why did you say you did? And they thought there's no way the investigators would do such a thing. That's why it didn't come to changing it as much as it should have done.""     "

923,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.

924,"Bangladesh are on the worst losing run in the history of one-day cricket, hardly the perfect preparation for the World Cup.  It is almost four years since their last win - the shock victory over Pakistan at the 1999 World Cup.  They have suffered 25 defeats over four years, a world record that surpasses the one they established in losing their first 22 matches between 1986 and 1998.  In that period they have lost to each of the nine other sides that compete in Test cricket.  It is a sorry state of affairs and Bangladesh's place as the 10th Test-playing nation at cricket's top table has been seriously questioned.  For as well as their woeful one-day record, Bangladesh have yet to win a Test match in 17 outings.  Their present run of eight successive losses is also a record for the longer version of the game.  ""We still have a long way to go and need to work hard and concentrate harder to reach that kind of level.  ""But otherwise the morale in the side is fine and the discipline is excellent, which is very important.""  He is the third coach to occupy the post since Gordon Greenidge was sacked on the morning of that famous victory over Pakistan.  The West Indian was replaced by South African Eddie Barlow, a man held in high esteem in his adopted country before he left the post after suffering a brain haemorrhage.  Australian Trevor Chappell subsequently oversaw a relative downturn in the team's fortunes before he was, in turn, replaced by Kamal.  Never once in the run of defeats he has watched over has Kamal's team looked like winning.  A highest score of 226 was easily surpassed by Sri Lanka and would not have been enough in any of the 13 matches they have played over the last year.  And Bangladesh's bowlers are seemingly incapable of exerting any kind of authority over opponents.  However, a new losing streak is sure to start in the very next match and it remains to be seen how long it will last."

Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."

931,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
932,"Half of all fatal road crashes occur on one-tenth of Britain's roads, according to the Road Safety Foundation charity.  Its report, covering 28,000 miles of A-roads and motorways, says on average Scotland has the highest-risk highways, followed by parts of northern England.  The most dangerous individual road was the A537 between Macclesfield, Cheshire, and Buxton, Derbyshire.  The charity wants government spending to be targeted at improving safety on the most dangerous roads.  Its report, entitled Saving Lives for Less, suggests the high cost of emergency services and hospitals could be avoided by spending small sums in accident blackspots.  The foundation is the British arm of the European Road Assessment Programme, the sister organisation of EuroNCAP, which measures car safety.  It examined accident data relating to roads across Britain. Among its conclusions were:  The most improved road was named as the A40 between Llandovery and Carmarthen.  Improved junctions and markings, along with resurfacing with high friction, anti-skid treatments, saw the number of serious accidents fall from 27 between 2003 and 2005 to seven in the following three years.  Foundation director Dr Joanne Hill said such simple, well-planned engineering measures were relatively inexpensive.  ""Not only can Britain reduce road deaths and serious injuries but, by targeting a relatively small mileage of high-risk roads, we can do so with good economic returns.  ""Too often we pay for emergency services, hospitals and care for the disabled rather than taking easy steps to put road design faults right.""  A quarter of the road length in the survey was in Scotland, where one in nine fatal crashes occurred.  On average ratings across all the regions, Scotland had the most dangerous motorway and A-road network, with 12% in the higher risk categories.  But when it came to the highest risk individual roads, none of the Scottish ones made Britain's top 10.  The study, using figures from 2006 to 2008, divided the road network into ""significant sections"" of various lengths.  It then calculated the risk by dividing the number of fatalities on a given section by the number of kilometres driven on it.  The report said the A537 through the Peak District, known as the Cat and Fiddle, had severe bends, steep falls from the carriageway and was edged by dry-stone walls or rock face for almost all its length.  Fatal and serious collisions on the route - popular with tourists, goods vehicles and motorcyclists - rose from 15 in the three years to 2005 to 34 between 2006 and 2008.  Most crashes happened at weekends during the summer in dry, daylight conditions.  The report also names the highest-risk roads when crashes involving motorcyclists are excluded, with a stretch of the A18 in North East Lincolnshire topping the list.  Most of these roads are single-carriageway A-roads, with nine of the 10 in northern England."
933,"Details of plans for Army restructuring were announced by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon on Thursday. Four infantry battalions are to be axed, reducing the number from 40 to 36. The infantry will be organised into larger, multi-battalion regiments. One battalion will go from the Scottish Division, one from the area west of the Pennines, one battalion from the Prince of Wales's Division in the south of England and one from the Parachute Regiment. Two historic single battalion regiments in Scotland are to merge. The Royal Scots will merge with The King's Own Scottish Borderers. They will combine with the other four Scottish regiments, including the Black Watch, to form a new large regiment, The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Mr Hoon said the identities of the regiments would be preserved by including them prominently in the battalion titles of the new regiment. In England, the King's Own Royal Border Regiment will amalgamate with the King's Regiment and the Queen's Lancashire Regiment to form two new battalions within the new King's Lancashire and Border Regiment. One battalion will go from the Prince of Wales's Division through a merger of elements of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, which will then merge with the Light Infantry, while the rest will merge with the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. The fourth infantry battalion reduction will be found by removing the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment from the infantry structure, and using its manpower as the core of a new, tri-service ranger unit. The Army will not reduce the number of Gurkha or Foot Guards battalions. In addition to these changes, other regiments will also merge to form new larger regiments. The Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Regiment of Wales will combine to become the Welsh Regiment. The Staffordshire Regiment, Cheshire Regiment and Worcester and Sherwood Foresters will combine as the Mercian Regiment. The Duke of Wellington's Regiment, The Prince of Wales' Own Regiment and The Green Howards will come together to form The Yorkshire Regiment . As part of the wider rebalancing of the mix of light, medium and heavy forces, 19 Mechanised Brigade will re-form to a light brigade from next month. It will be ready to be deployed, if required, in 2006 when it will serve as the contingent Nato response force. The 4 Armoured Brigade, which is currently based in Germany, split between Osnabruck and Munster, will begin to convert to a mechanised brigade in 2006. The manpower freed up by the reduction in battalions will be reallocated to key specialities such as communications, engineers, logisticians and intelligence experts, where there are current shortages. Mr Hoon said the Territorial Army will be more closely integrated with the Army for training and operations. Each of the 14 regular TA infantry battalions will be part of a regular parent regiment. There will be a reduction in the Corps of Army Music (CAMUS) by around 280 posts. This will result in the reduction of six Army bands and reduce the size of a seventh. Bands will continue to be identified primarily with regiments and corps and, given the importance of military music to the maintenance of regimental spirit, will continue to be organised on the basis of their primary role - the provision of Army music. Individuals affected by the changes will be provided with the chance to retrain for on new tasks. However the reductions in infantry and bandsmen will require a limited redundancy programme. The Army will continue around its current size. At around 102,000 strong it will continue to require over 11,000 new recruits every year.        "
934,"A Dutch court has fined the owner of the Netherlands' biggest cannabis-selling coffee shop 10m euros (£9m, $13.3m) for breaking drugs laws.  Owner Meddie Willemsen, who was tried along with 15 staff of the Checkpoint coffee shop in Terneuzen, was also sentenced to a 16-week prison term.  He was convicted for keeping more than the maximum tolerated amount of 500g (18oz) of drugs at the cafe.  Checkpoint served up to 3,000 people a day before being closed last year.  On a couple of occasions, police found 200kg (440lb) of cannabis when they raided the coffee house.  Willemsen was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, but was released as he had already spent the time in jail ahead of the trial.  He and his staff were convicted of breaking drugs laws, exporting drugs and membership of a criminal organisation.  The 10m euro fine was lower than the 28m euro fine prosecutors had asked for because of the ""role of the authorities"" in allowing Checkpoint to grow unchecked.  ""Checkpoint could not have expanded as much as it did without collaboration from the municipality of Terneuzen,"" a court statement said.  The town, close to the Belgian border, put up road signs showing the way to the Checkpoint and built a car park near it to reduce traffic congestion in town.  Though technically illegal, the Netherlands decriminalised the consumption and possession of under 5g (0.18oz) of cannabis in 1976 under an official ""tolerance"" policy."

936,"With coal a nationalised industry, and some British mines unprofitable, coal mining was ripe for repositioning - and even privatisation - by Margaret Thatcher's right wing Conservative government of the 1980s. In the early 1980s, the National Union of Miners (NUM) was very strong, with high membership and strong links to the Labour Party. It was also defiantly left wing and militant, with no compunction against threatening industrial action. In 1981, there was the threat of strike when pit closures were mooted, and the government backed down, not feeling its position was strong enough. In 1983, Thatcher appointed Ian MacGregor head of the National Coal Board, which oversaw the industry. He had a reputation for swingeing cutbacks and closures from his previous role at British Steel. The coal industry was ripe for further confrontation between the NUM and the government, and resolutions were passed by various NUM regions to strike if pits were closed for reasons other than geological or resource exhaustion. By the end of 1983, with the Falklands War won and a mandate from that year's general election, Thatcher felt far more secure in her position and was willing to tackle the unions. The struggle over the mining industry would largely come to define her premiership.  In 1984, the announcement came that 20 pits were to close, with 20,000 jobs to go. It was later disclosed that the government, in preparation for the much-anticipated industrial action, had been stockpiling coal to take Britain through the winter. Initial locally-organised strikes across the UK became a national NUM strike in March 1984. But NUM leader Arthur Scargill decreed that NUM regions could decide whether or not to strike on an independent basis. Margaret Thatcher ratcheted up the pressure by referring to striking miners as ""the enemy within"". She continually referred to the action as ""the rule of the mob"". Scargill, in turn, compared the government's techniques in crowd control to those of a ""Latin American state"". The dispute had little chance of ending amicably or quickly. As the strike continued, strains and stresses began to be felt. The workers earned no money and were ineligible for benefits as the strike was deemed illegal; they had to rely on scrimping, saving and handouts. Personal relationships strained and sometimes broke as some decided to work through the strike, becoming 'scabs' in the lexicon of industrial relations. On the picket lines, buses carrying 'scabs' were attacked, and other disturbances took place. Miners clashed with massed ranks of police repeatedly and fiercely all over the country. Some industrial unions supported the miners and some disagreed, to the extent that the government gathered information from them. Observance of the strike within Wales differed from north to south. In the north, only 35% of the 1,000 men employed went on strike, and this had dwindled to 10% by the strike's end in 1985. By contrast, the south Wales coalfield contained the staunchest supporters of industrial action. At the start of the strike, 99.6% of the 21,500 workers joined the action. This reduced to 93% by the end. No other area retained such a level. With so many men not working in an area which was almost single-industry, South Wales suffered hugely with deprivation and community breakdown. Some areas broke down irretrievably, with the effects visible for years afterwards in ghost villages in the Valleys.  One incident in south Wales accelerated the ending the strike and turned some otherwise sympathetic members of the public against the miners. The killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver, was a tragedy and a public relations disaster for the NUM. Wilkie was driving David Williams, a working miner, to the Merthyr Vale mine with a police escort on 30 November 1984. Two striking miners dropped a 21kg concrete block from a bridge onto the car, killing Wilkie instantly. This coincided with a gradual slide in public and media support for the action, amid scandals and accusations. Families found it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves and the NUM funds were running too low to pay for pickets' transport. The official end of the strike came on 3 March 1985, when a vote was passed to return to work even without a new agreement with management. The pits closed rapidly over the next few years, and in 1994 the industry was finally privatised. In 1995 miners famously bought the Tower Colliery in the Cynon Valley, which opened in 1805, to keep it as a going concern. It became Wales' only working coal mine, and the oldest continuously worked deep-coal mine in the UK. That too, is closing due to dwindling coal seams, bringing to an end an industry which once employed almost 200,000 men."

939,"At its simplest, journalism is about telling people things they don't know. So when the Ministry of Defence approached the BBC - along with other parts of the UK media - to ask us not to tell our audiences about a possible deployment of Prince Harry to Afghanistan, it was something we thought long and hard about.  A news black-out is unusual, but not unique. An agreement exists between the police and the media over the reporting of kidnaps - the police have the right to request that media organisations don't report an abduction while negotiations are under way, in case it makes the release of the hostage more difficult; in return, they accept the responsibility to update the media regularly and reveal the full story, on camera, once the situation has been resolved. When lives are at risk, it's not always helpful to have things played out in the glare of publicity.  Last summer - on the day my colleague Alan Johnston was released in Gaza - the Chief of the General Staff, Sir Richard Dannatt, met editors to make the case for a voluntary agreement. He was very candid; Harry wanted a career in the Army and he needed to be able to be deployed to do what he'd been trained to do, even if it was just for a day.  After five months of discussions, using the kidnap agreement as our model, the MoD and the UK media reached an understanding; we wouldn't speculate or report on the prince's deployments to minimise the danger to him and to others. In return, we'd get access to him before, during and after his time in Afghanistan. It was a voluntary agreement - any of the organisations could have decided to leave at any time. We - and the other UK broadcasters and newspapers - were clear that we would not report his deployment.  So, for the past ten weeks, the BBC, ITV and Sky News have been filming with Prince Harry - the first time we've been up close and personal with him. We interviewed him at Clarence House in mid-December, just before he was sent to Afghanistan, we spent some time with him at the start of January when he was settling in at a remote base in Southern Helmand Province, and most recently, we filmed with him last week at a new location in Helmand Province.  In truth, the surprise is that the agreement lasted so long. We - and the other UK broadcasters - were clear that we would not report his deployment. But nor would we deceive our audiences.  On Christmas Day, when neither Prince William nor Prince Harry attended the regular service with other members of the Royal Family at Sandringham, we agreed with the Ministry of Defence that they would say that both princes were spending Christmas with their regiments - William volunteered for Christmas duty to help out his brother! It prompted some inquiries from one US TV network who had to be briefed on the story.  More recently, on Tuesday, the German newspaper Bild ran a diary story asking ""where's Prince Harry?"" and speculating that the gossip was that ""he'd gone to war"". We agreed that while the story was speculative and confined to diary pages, that we would not break the agreement we'd reached with the MoD.  Then yesterday, the Drudge Report - the online US website famous for breaking the story of Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky - put the story on its front page. The game was up. We, and the other broadcasters, agreed with the Ministry of Defence that the story was out and it would be wrong not to tell our audiences what had been going on.  We don't do this stuff lightly - there are no other ""voluntary agreements"" in place at the moment, there's nothing else we're not telling you. Until yesterday, only a handful of people in the BBC knew about the story - trust me, keeping secrets from other journalists is hard work! Our job normally is to make these things public, not keep them from you. But this was never just about Prince Harry's safety, it was also about the security of the soldiers serving with him. No editor wants to be responsible for increasing the risk they already face from the Taleban. Nor do I think our audiences would have thanked us for doing so.  "
940,"The judgement clears the way for prosecutions of officials suspected of human rights abuses during military rule between 1976 and 1983.  President Nestor Kirchner, who called the amnesties ""shameful"", said the ruling restored faith in the judiciary.  Civil liberties groups say about 30,000 people were killed or went missing under the former dictatorship.  The Supreme Court upheld a decision by the Argentine Congress in August 2003 to scrap the amnesty laws.  The court voted by seven to one, with one abstention, to strike down two amnesty laws which had been in effect since 1986.  The campaign ended with the country's return to civilian rule in October 1983.  President Kirchner said: ""The court's decision has restored our faith in justice. This is a blast of fresh air that signifies the end of impunity.""  About 3,000 military officers - about 300 of whom still serve in the armed forces - could be accused, the Associated Press news agency reported.  Ahead of the ruling, Argentine Defence Minister Jose Pampuro said some officers were anxious pending the outcome.  ""In a personal capacity, some men who might be involved in some situation are expressing worry,"" he was quoted by AP as saying.

941,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."
942,"About 100,000 tonnes of sand has been earmarked to be taken from Montrose to shore up the Aberdeen beachfront.  However golfers in the Angus town say the proposal means that their erosion threatened course could be sacrificed.  The plan to take sand dredged from Montrose harbour in Angus up to Aberdeen was recently unveiled by the Scottish Executive.  Members at Montrose Golf Links argue one of the oldest courses in the world should be preserved.  One member, Montrose Central councillor Terry Wood, told BBC Scotland: ""The golf links is a great asset to Montrose.  ""The golfers believe the sand should be used to protect the golf course dunes.  ""They cannot understand why it is going to Aberdeen when it is needed to protect our own beach from erosion.  ""The Golf Links Trust would have to realign the course.""  The executive announced the funding package to bring in more sand after Aberdeen City Council officials warned that the city's sands could be lost in about 100 years, with homes and businesses destroyed by flooding.  The scheme would replenish Aberdeen with thousands of tonnes of sand from Montrose harbour.  The project was born after a previous funding scheme for the beach was turned down by the executive."

945,"The judgement clears the way for prosecutions of officials suspected of human rights abuses during military rule between 1976 and 1983.  President Nestor Kirchner, who called the amnesties ""shameful"", said the ruling restored faith in the judiciary.  Civil liberties groups say about 30,000 people were killed or went missing under the former dictatorship.  The Supreme Court upheld a decision by the Argentine Congress in August 2003 to scrap the amnesty laws.  The court voted by seven to one, with one abstention, to strike down two amnesty laws which had been in effect since 1986.  The campaign ended with the country's return to civilian rule in October 1983.  President Kirchner said: ""The court's decision has restored our faith in justice. This is a blast of fresh air that signifies the end of impunity.""

948,"A controversial painting showing South Africa's President Jacob Zuma with his genitals hanging out has been vandalised in an art gallery.  The BBC's Andrew Harding at the gallery in Johannesburg said two men covered the art work in black and red paint  It comes as the governing ANC was asking the High Court to force the Goodman Gallery to remove the painting.  The $14,000 (£9,000) 1.85m-high Soviet-style, red black and yellow acrylic painting had already been sold.  Called The Spear, the painting is by Brett Murray, who is known for his political and provocative work.  Footage shown on local television showed a man in a suit painting a red cross over the president's genital area and then his face, AP news agency reports.  Then another man, wearing a hooded top, rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting with his hands.  ""The white middle-aged man was the one who started it off and a young black man finished it off,"" Lance Claasen, a Khaya FM radio reporter who witnessed the defacing, told the AFP news agency.  Our correspondent says he saw one man wielding the paint brush, who was then pounced on by security guards and head-butted at one point.  ""I'm doing this because the painting is disrespectful to President Zuma,"" one of the men told the BBC.  The African National Congress has described the work as ""rude, crude and disrespectful"".  Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
949,"It's a measure of how highly the directors of the British Broadcasting Company rated John Reith that they supported his proposals for a public corporation – even though it meant making themselves redundant in favour of governors on January 1st, 1927. Unfortunately for Reith, those former directors had given him a much freer hand to operate than his new ministerially-appointed board - some even wanted to meet daily. Reith distrusted the new chairman, Lord Clarendon, and called him behind his back 'a silly ass'. He was even more vehement about another governor, Ethel Snowden, wife of Philip Snowden, the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer: ""a truly terrible creature, ignorant, stupid and horrid.""  The feeling was mutual. Mrs Snowden's description of Reith was: ""a man whose overwhelming egoism is as distasteful as his character and ability are overestimated.""  Reith stayed at the helm of the Corporation for another eleven years, but the organisation he had created – and in many ways was still creating – was never the same for him.  ""The Archbishop had on his proper robes… and looked very fine""  Reith was nearly 39 and had been married six years when, in 1928, he and Muriel had a baby boy, Christopher John (they had a daughter Marista four years later).  And it was clear only the best would do for their first-born. Reith immediately decided to put his name down for Eton; and asked his friend the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, to perform the baptism. For a son of a Scottish Manse to ask a Primate of the Church of England to perform the ceremony raised some eyebrows.  A couple of years earlier he had turned down an invitation to become a church elder at St Columba's in London because it was part of the Church of Scotland; he explained he wanted to keep his links with his father's denomination, the even more strictly Protestant United Free Church of Scotland. Now he wanted his son to be baptised into what St Columba's minister reminded him in a letter was 'the Anglican branch of the Catholic Church'. Reith, not for the first time in his life, was impressed by the trappings of British society.  With pleasure he observed after the baptism at Lambeth Palace that 'The Archbishop had on his proper robes with the GCVO ribbon and looked very fine.'  ""I will not read any slower; I am going on announcing""  Reith was no behind-the-scenes administrator.  When it came to historic events, like the General Strike and the 1936 Abdication speech of Edward VIII, Reith himself took to the microphone.  Another occasion was the 1929 election, which was won by Labour's Ramsay MacDonald. Reith had been in contact with the parties beforehand about their election addresses.  'MacDonald was ineffective', he noted, though Prime Minister Baldwin impressed him by asking about the social make-up of the radio audience.  The senior Conservative Neville Chamberlain was more cavalier; and Reith in his memoirs complained he didn't take the power of broadcasting seriously enough:  'Neville Chamberlain on arrival at Savoy Hill said he was going to make a poor show – in fact he did – as he had no time for preparation.  What more important work could he have been doing during the week?'  But Reith's own election performance turned out to be a let-down.  The BBC's election results service had been rehearsed, but during the second bulletin of the evening, Reith announced he would read all the results himself until 1.30am.  He hadn't been doing it long when listeners rang asking for the reader to be clearer and to read slower.  The man with the job of explaining this to his Director General was the announcer Eric Dunstan.  He later recalled: 'I did my best politely to inform him of the position, but all he said was: ""I will not read any slower; I am going on announcing"" and he turned his back on me.'  A furious Dunstan stormed out of the building.  He said afterwards:  'The listening public wants clear and efficient announcing, and this is the announcer's job and no one else's.'  Dunstan was replaced the next day.  ""Under the control of that rare individual who acts according to his spiritual convictions""  Reith's reputation as a hardline religious boss was cemented by events in 1929 involving his chief engineer Peter Eckersley.  Popular perception has it that Reith sacked him for an extra-marital affair.  It wasn't so clear-cut.  Certainly Reith had a religious streak to him; one BBC interviewee in the1920s remembers being asked by the Director-General: 'Do you accept the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ?'  But it was the disapproval of Eckersley's senior engineering colleagues that brought matters to a head.  The 'other woman' was Dorothy Clark, the estranged wife of the BBC's music adviser, Edward Clark. Before their marriage, she seems to have been what is now known as a ""wild-child""; the daughter of affluent parents who became an actress and twice got pregnant while on tour. Eckersley first saw her when she was already separated from Edward and was visiting the BBC's Savoy Hill headquarters.  Once their affair began, it seems Edward had no objections. On one occasion he plotted with Eckersley for both to visit Germany on BBC business and take Dorothy with them.  Later, the chief engineer got bolder, taking Dorothy on a BBC visit to Brussels and regularly being seen with her at Savoy Hill. Colleagues who knew his wife Stella, were outraged.  In January 1929, it was brought to Reith's attention.  Reith acted cautiously.  He first spoke to Eckersley, then invited him and his lover to his flat to explain that Eckersley risked losing his job unless the affair ended.  Reith's wife Muriel broke the news to Stella, who knew nothing about the romance. The governors were consulted.  Ethel Snowden wanted instant dismissal, though the chairman and Reith were more cautious and wanted Eckersley to resign and be reinstated later if his marriage could be patched up.  Reith asked for advice from the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Admiral Byng, who was far more hard-line.  He said a BBC man was like a policeman and never off duty: Eckersley, Byng believed, should be sacked.  But Reith didn't follow the advice. Eckersley promised to end the affair and offered his resignation.  He let Reith decide what to do with it and Reith recommended to the Governors that he should stay. It was a brief respite. In April 1929,  Eckersley ran into Dorothy at a party and decided on the spot to leave his wife. The popular image is of Reith pointing to the door like an Old Testament prophet and condemning Eckersley for straying from the paths of righteousness. In fact, when  the governors accepted the chief engineer's  resignation, they awarded him £1,000 in recognition of his valuable service and kept him on as a consultant for another year.  Eckersley in his memoirs believed Reith, as both a Christian and the head of a national organisation, was entitled to sack him, though he thought a different boss might have been more lenient: ' I happened to come under the control of that rare individual who acts according to his spiritual convictions.'  ""It would have been fun to have had the hammer and sickle flying over Broadcasting House""  During Reith's time, the BBC had three headquarters buildings in London.  It began at Magnet House in Kingsway, with the 2LO studios further down the road in the Strand.  Soon after in 1923, it began moving operations to nearby Savoy Hill.  But as the BBC expanded, it outgrew this too.  Reith seems to have been unimpressed by the new Broadcasting House, which opened in 1932.  He wrote – a decade after he left the Corporation - that he had not been happy with it, and had left the development to others. He thought it was too early for what he called 'a comprehensive headquarters for British broadcasting.'  The BBC flag first flew above the 'prow' of the ship-like BH on May 2, 1932, but when overseas broadcasting dignitaries visited, the flags of their countries would be run up instead.  Impishly Reith wrote:  'To my regret the head of the Russian system never came to London; it would have been fun to have had the hammer and sickle flying over Broadcasting House and hear what some people had to say.'  ""What a miserable lot they are""  Reith's struggles with his Board of Governors continued for years.  The week after Peter Eckersely resigned in 1929, he was surprised how smoothly the governors' meeting went.  Then he found out they had been rushing off to the chairman Lord Clarendon's house for an informal meeting without their Director General.  'What a miserable lot they are, ' he wrote.  He was also annoyed the Governors would lunch at the Savoy without inviting him.  It was a relief when Clarendon was replaced in 1930 and by that time Reith decided he would prefer to be BBC chairman than Director General.  When the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald didn't give it to him, he described himself as disgusted.  He saw MacDonald at a funeral service shortly after and 'I directed a glare of malevolence'.  The new chairman was a former Commons Speaker,  John Henry Whitley who was nervous about working with the fearsome DG.  But the Postmaster General Hastings Lees-Smith told him not to be daunted, telling him Reith wouldn't be long at the BBC ""because he will end up in a lunatic asylum"".  He was wrong, but not wildly so. Reith did receive treatment at the  Psychological Clinic of Glasgow during his break-up with Charlie Bowser a decade earlier; and and in later life received electric shock treatment for depression.  Also, Reith's brother Ernest died in a lunatic asylum.  ""Where does he get his Mussolini traits?""  By the 1930s, Reith had an image problem that never left him.  It was made worse because – in an age of dictators - it was easy to make comparisons.  When Reith took his mother to tea at the House of Commons, the MP Nancy Astor asked if he got his 'Mussolini traits' from her.  During a Commons debate in 1936 on the BBC, the Labour MP George Lansbury said Reith ""would have made a very excellent Hitler for his country."" Another Labour member, Hastings Lees Smith – the former minister who predicted Reith would end up in an asylum – called the BBC 'the nearest thing in this country to Nazi government that can be shown.'  Reith's own comments didn't help.  He said he admired Mussolini and talked in 1939 of Hitler's 'magnificent efficiency'.  He also had a sneaking admiration for the German broadcasters: 'Germany has banned hot jazz and I'm sorry that we should be behind in dealing with this filthy product of modernity.'  ""We are thoroughly disgusted with the false and malignant statements about the Director General""  During the 1930s, Reith fought off attempts to introduce a staff association in the BBC to give employees a bigger say.  One supporter of the idea was  Clement Attlee, later to be Labour's postwar Prime Minister. Attlee suggested that Reith ruled 'a little by fear'. But in a comment that shows his firm belief in managerial hierarchy, Reith denied the charge:  '…unless the awareness and respect which a subordinate should feel of and for his chief is to be called fear – the fear a man should have of not doing as well as he might; of letting himself down; of letting his chief down.'  In 1934 Reith appeared in front of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs.  He expected a rough ride from critics about staff relations, based on newspaper campaigns against him. But when challenged, he passed a letter to the chairman, signed by 800 members of staff that was given to him as he left Broadcasting House for the meeting.  It read:  'The undersigned members of the staff of the BBC, thoroughly disgusted with the false and malignant statements about the director-general being published in certain newspapers, wish to record their detestation of the newspapers concerned, and to reaffirm their loyalty and gratitude to the director-general.'  The committee's critics melted away after that coup de theatre. But then Reith's sense of the dramatic was honed with the BBC's staff amateur dramatic company. The man accused of being aloof from his workforce  regularly appeared in its productions.  His last role was in 1936 playing a butler in a play performed at the Fortune Theatre in London. The Daily Mail reviewer described Reith as 'looking uncommonly like Boris Karloff at his most sinister'.  ""Usually on holiday when significant events in television took place""  Throughout Reith's time at the Corporation, it continued to expand. His determination meant its radio broadcasts spread to the Empire, too. The idea of an Empire Service was well received by politicians, but they could not agree who would pay the costs. It was Reith who took it upon himself – and the British licence payer – to go ahead without them. What became the World Servjce was later described by the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as ""Britain's greatest gift to the world in the 20th century."" On the first day of the Empire Service, in 1932, Reith personally delivered the opening address.  Because of the different time zones, he had to deliver his words live five times over the next 15½ hours.  He was less interested in the development of television.  Anthony Kamm, the biographer of television's inventor, John Logie Baird, says that Reith usually managed to be on holiday when significant events in television took place.  One explanation is his background in the Free Church of Scotland, where the Word was what mattered and church decoration was kept to a minimum  to avoid distractions. The BBC historian A S A Briggs believes Reith saw television as a threat to society: 'he thought it would really corrupt and ruin the nation and you can't go much further than that.'  At the 1937 Coronation of George V Reith declined an invitation to put the BBC in charge of filming. One of his leaving gifts when he left the BBC in 1938 was a television set. He said he would never look at it.  ""Good evening, Reith. Very nice of you to make all these arrangements""  In 1936 the new King Edward VIII renounced the Throne to marry the divorcee Mrs Simpson.  The King wanted to speak to the nation about the affair, but had to wait until the abdication was approved by Parliament.  Reith went personally to Windsor Castle, where engineers had set up a microphone for the 10pm broadcast.  The former King was grateful: 'Good evening, Reith.  Very nice of you to make all these arrangements and to come over yourself.'  Reith made the introduction, calling him 'His Royal Highness the Prince Edward', then slipped out of the chair for the prince to take his place.  As he moved in, Edward kicked the table leg with a bang clearly heard over the microphone.  Listeners thought it was a sign of Reith's disapproval, imagining the moralistic DG had walked out and slammed the door behind him.  Why Reith left the BBC in 1938 is still a mystery, which even he doesn't seem to have understood. He later called his resignation 'a frightful mistake', though his daughter Marista thinks he was trying to cover up the fact that he'd been pushed out. Reith's biographer Ian McIntyre says he wasn't pushed: he jumped.  He'd been announcing for years he wanted to leave.  Indeed as the BBC began a new Charter period in 1937, he offered the Governors his resignation so they could begin this new chapter with a fresh face.  Reith's diaries talk about his constant search for new challenges, though the BBC historian  A S A Briggs says there were challenges enough in the BBC, had he wanted to take them; like developing  television and how to handle mass communication in wartime.  But the facts of his departure are these. He was called to Downing Street early in June 1938 to see the Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's top adviser Sir Horace Wilson. He offered Reith the full-time job as chairman of the struggling government-subsidised Imperial Airways, 'starting tomorrow if possible'.  Reith had already heard his name linked with the job so wasn't surprised, but he insisted on Chamberlain making the job offer personally. His interview with Chamberlain sounds bizarre. Reith didn't fight to keep his BBC job and didn't argue with the Prime Minister. Nor did Chamberlain 'instruct' him to take it.  'He said he wasn't using that word. So I asked if he wanted me to go.  He said again that was maybe too strong but that if I went he would be very glad.'  And that was how, after 18 years in charge of British broadcasting, Reith got a new job. It wasn't an order, he could have refused and he didn't even get a peerage or extra money out of it.  In his memoirs he wrote: 'I said I was getting £10,000 from the BBC and would not require any increase on that.'  ""I resign, I shall resign, I have resigned.  There it is – in all three tenses…""  Reith's had hoped his new job running Imperial Airways would not cut all his links with the BBC and he might be appointed a Governor.  But the chairman, R C Norman, told him that his presence on the board would be unfair on his successor.  The governors also decided he should not help to choose his replacement, who turned out to be Sir Frederick Ogilvie, Vice Chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast.  Reith had wanted an internal appointment, but on the governors' behalf had rung up Ogilvie to see if he was interested.   Reith's view of him: 'a man of fine character and outlook; of personal charm…. I was quite sure he was not the man for the BBC.'  On June 30th, 1938, Reith left Broadcasting House for the last time as DG.  He had asked to go without ceremony and – as he put it – 'one walked out as quietly as one had walked in'.  He carried out one more duty.  Along with his secretary and his deputy Cecil Graves – the man he wanted to replace him – they drove to the BBC transmitter at Droitwich in Worcestershire to switch it off at midnight.  He signed the visitors book: 'J C W Reith – late BBC'.  There was a postscript to this.  A week later, the BBC governors realised Reith had not handed in a written resignation. The chairman had to remind him. In a bitter reply, Reith responded: 'I resign, I shall resign, I have resigned. There it is – in all three tenses…'"

953,"A Dutch court has fined the owner of the Netherlands' biggest cannabis-selling coffee shop 10m euros (£9m, $13.3m) for breaking drugs laws.  Owner Meddie Willemsen, who was tried along with 15 staff of the Checkpoint coffee shop in Terneuzen, was also sentenced to a 16-week prison term.  He was convicted for keeping more than the maximum tolerated amount of 500g (18oz) of drugs at the cafe.  Checkpoint served up to 3,000 people a day before being closed last year.  On a couple of occasions, police found 200kg (440lb) of cannabis when they raided the coffee house.  Willemsen was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, but was released as he had already spent the time in jail ahead of the trial.  He and his staff were convicted of breaking drugs laws, exporting drugs and membership of a criminal organisation.  The 10m euro fine was lower than the 28m euro fine prosecutors had asked for because of the ""role of the authorities"" in allowing Checkpoint to grow unchecked.  ""Checkpoint could not have expanded as much as it did without collaboration from the municipality of Terneuzen,"" a court statement said.  The town, close to the Belgian border, put up road signs showing the way to the Checkpoint and built a car park near it to reduce traffic congestion in town.  Though technically illegal, the Netherlands decriminalised the consumption and possession of under 5g (0.18oz) of cannabis in 1976 under an official ""tolerance"" policy."

956,"In 1917 people were astounded by harbours full of colourful ships. But some of the visual impact of Wilkinson’s camouflage is lost today in the black and white images we have of World War One. The striking colours can still be seen on hundreds of model ships in the collection of the Imperial War Museum.  These were made by the Dazzle Section at the Royal Academy of Arts, at Burlington House in London. Scale models were painted and used to test dazzle designs. They were placed on a rotating turntable and viewed through a periscope.  This allowed Wilkinson’s team to see how dazzle distorted a ship’s form as if it were travelling in different directions. Wilkinson believed that using strong contrasts, with light and dark greys, blues and greens, was most effective.  Wilkinson appointed dock officers at ports around Britain. They supervised the painting of ships from the finished designs. One dock officer was the artist Edward Wadsworth. He was a founder of Vorticism - a British art movement that grew out of Cubism.  The Admiralty experimented with various camouflage ideas during WW1. They had considered similar proposals by US artist Abbot H Thayer and the Scottish zoologist John Graham Kerr.  However, it was Wilkinson’s scheme that won them over. After the war the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors awarded him £2000 and recognised him as the creator of dazzle."

958,"        Magnificent terracotta objects have been found in Nok, in Nigeria, dating back to a period some time between 500 BC and 500 AD. These are the earliest known sculptures on the continent, next to those of Ancient Egypt.       Later around 900 AD, the Igbo-Ukwo was making finely and intricately worked, bronze ceremonial objects. Against this background of creativity and craftsmanship, the Yoruba kingdoms of Benin and Ife sprang up between the 11th and 12th centuries.          In Yoruba mythology, Ife was founded by a senior deity Oduduwa, acting on the order of the supreme deity Olorun (also known as Oludmare). Oduduwa became the first ruler, or Ooni, of Ife.     We know little of how these early Ooni exercised power or how their territory was administered, or precisely when the kingship started. We know that the landscape out of which Ife (and Benin) emerged consisted of a mixture of tropical forests and savannah land, affording very fertile soil and a high rainfall.          One of the keys to understanding the success and wealth of these kingdoms was the ability to provide a significant food surplus. This released labour, which could then be channelled into creating great works of art centred largely on celebrating kingship.      We can still see today an astounding range of objects made of bronze, brass, copper, wood, ceramic and ivory. The superb level of Ife craftsmanship expressed, using the ""lost wax"" method, is comparable with the finest examples of metal-work in Europe from Classical and Renaissance times.       &quotThe art was largely motivated by the culture, the cultural practices of the people. They had to produce certain objects, which they used for certain ritual purposes.&quot   Dr. Ohioma Pogoson, historian and lecturer at University of Ibadan, The African Institute, Nigeria.      Click here to listen to Dr. Pogoson on the political context of art      &quotThe art of Ife and Benin is so important because one gives birth to the other. The Ife art was the most ancient in the forest region of Nigeria, simply because the Ife civilisation goes as far back as 300 - 500 BC. Therefore, it had developed a lot of artefacts, which marks the history of Ife.     Ife later gave birth not only to Benin, but also to the art of Igbo, the Onitsha art, even going as far as to the hinterland of the Igbo, Igbo Ukwu.&quot      Click here to listen to Dr. Eluyemi explaining the relationship between Ife and Benin         Ife was at one time considered the most senior Yuruba state. But by the 17th century it was eclipsed by Oyo. Lying further north, Oyo had the military advantage of a cavalry, and the right agricultural conditions to grow cereal. In the 18th century Oyo reached its peak, largely by profits of the slave trade. With the abolition of slavery its power waned. Today Ife continues to be regarded as the spiritual centre for all Yoruba, and the Ooni of Ife has considerable influence in the country.          The kingship of Benin is closely related to Ife. The first king, or Oba, of Benin is traditionally supposed to be a descendant of Oduduwa, the founder of Ife. The most distinctive examples of Benin craftsmanship are the bronze plaques, which adorned the palace walls. As in the artwork of Ife, the craftsmen of Benin produced bronze and copper heads celebrating the power of the Oba.      The capital of Benin (not to be confused with the modern state of Benin, formerly Dahomey) was south west of Ife. One of the few early written accounts of this centre of power and trade is given by a Portuguese slave trader Joao Afonso Aveiro, who was astounded by what he described as the 'great city of Benin'. Over a hundred years later, a Dutch visitor compared it favourably with Amsterdam. Most of the art was looted by the British in 1897.      &quotA precise model of the object to be made is constructed out of wax. A mould - usually made out of clay - is then formed round the wax model. This is left to harden. The whole thing is then heated. The wax melts away, hence the expression ""lost wax.""      This leaves a hollow space in the shape of the model. Molten metal is then poured into this space, filling it completely. When the metal has cooled down and hardened, the mould is broken, leaving the object in its metal form.&quot       "

960,"The NHS's drugs watchdog has released guidance which says Velcade's cost-effectiveness has not been proven and more research is needed.  Patients and health charities have condemned the ruling by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.  Velcade slows the advance of myeloma - cancer of bone marrow plasma cells.  An announcement from NICE had not been expected until Tuesday, but it was brought forward after the ruling was apparently leaked to the press.  Andrea Sutcliffe, who led the drug appraisal, said she was concerned at ""misleading coverage"" in some national newspapers.  ""It is one thing to criticise our decision not to recommend the use of this drug, but quite another to unfairly raise patient expectations about the effect of this drug and its availability in other parts of the UK,"" she added.  Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with myeloma in the UK each year.  The charity, Myeloma UK, said no patient in the UK should die without having access to the drug.  A trial last year showed Velcade (bortezomib) could extend the life expectancy of a patient by an average of six months more than standard treatment. Treatment costs about £18,000 per patient.  The drug was approved for use in Scotland in 2004, where it is mainly used as a last resort.  The Daily Mail earlier reported that it had seen a leaked ruling, which said the drug was more clinically effective than chemotherapy but was not regarded as ""cost effective"".  Jacky Pickles, 44, one of three women with bone marrow cancer from Keighley in West Yorkshire, is campaigning to get the drug approved.  ""If NICE is going to get away with not backing these drugs, then we will be stuck in the dark ages.  ""Isn't three years of my life worth anything?""  Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said the NHS had become a ""Scottish and a separate English health service"".  NICE, which regulates primary care trusts in England and Wales, has come under repeated fire over its decisions not to fund drugs.  The guidance will be formally issued before the end of the year.  Objectors however can appeal against their decision.  Ms Sutcliffe, who led the appraisal for NICE, said the committee had considered comments received during consultation on an earlier draft and had not changed its conclusion.  ""Although the drug is clinically effective compared with high dose dexamethasone, its cost-effectiveness has not been satisfactorily demonstrated and therefore further research is required.""  A NICE spokesman added: ""NICE has appraised 26 cancer treatments to date, and we have recommended 25 of them for use by the NHS.""  A spokeswoman for Myeloma UK said the charity was taking legal advice over the ruling.  ""This represents probably the single biggest setback in the history of the treatment of myeloma.""  She said the entire myeloma community, including Myeloma UK and the other charities involved in the appraisal, were devastated.  ""Velcade is a proven and licensed treatment and, quite simply, no myeloma patient in the UK should die without having access to it."""
961,"The judge has agreed to the defence's request to admit questions about the complainant's personal history.  About 200 of Mr Zuma's supporters have gathered outside the court tearing up and burning pictures of the woman.  This follows Monday's graphic account of alleged events at Mr Zuma's home. Mr Zuma pleaded not guilty but said he had consensual sex with the woman.  Under cross-examination by the defence team in the Johannesburg High Court, the 31-year-old woman described how Mr Zuma and her father had been good friends while living in exile in the early 1980s.  Her father died in 1985. She explained the special closeness of people in the South African exile community and why it was that she regarded Jacob Zuma both as an uncle and a father figure, even though there was little contact between them for many years.  The complainant was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1999, although she did not tell Mr Zuma about this until two years later.  In 2004 he promised to help her with funding to study in the UK, but the money never materialised.  Earlier on Tuesday, the defence requested that the court admit questions concerning the woman's personal history, a request to which Judge Willem van der Merwe agreed.  On Monday, the judge ordered that the woman's identity not be made public, as the trial got under way after a three-week break.  Three judges earlier assigned to the case stood down - one of them because his sister had a child fathered by Mr Zuma.  The alleged victim testified on Monday that she was raped by Mr Zuma while visiting his home in Johannesburg's Forest Town suburb in November last year.  She also said that she had been ""pressured"" by various people and had been offered money to drop her accusations.  Mr Zuma - a veteran of the ANC struggle to end apartheid and a favourite of the party's left wing - was once thought a likely successor to Thabo Mbeki as South African president.  But the allegations and of rape as well as corruption - for which he will go on trial in July - are thought by many to have ended that prospect.  Mr Zuma remains deputy leader of the ruling ANC although it has been agreed that he should not perform any executive functions.  His support has waned since rape charges were laid, but he remains a popular politician.  Mr Zuma's supporters say the charges against him are the result of a conspiracy."

Earlier a crowd of ANC supporters had gathered near the court house in Johannesburg where the ruling party's challenge to get to the painting removed was being heard.  It was decided that a full bench of the High Court would hear the case on Thursday.  ""This is a matter of great national importance,"" the South African Press Association quotes Judge Kathree Setiloane as saying.  The exhibition at the Goodman Gallery opened earlier this month and was scheduled to close on 16 June.  The ANC is also demanding that the City Press newspaper remove a photograph of the painting from its website.  In an affidavit served on the paper, Mr Zuma said he was shocked by the work saying: ""The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect. It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children.""  ""It is an undignified depiction of my personality and seeks to create doubt about my personality in the eyes of fellow citizens, family and children,"" South Africa's Sunday Independent quotes his statement as saying.  President Zuma, who has four wives, has sued local media companies 11 times for defamation - some of which has been settled, others dropped, but most are outstanding.  The best-known case is a 2008 suit against one of the country's most high-profile artists, Zapiro, after he depicted Mr Zuma about to rape a female figure representing justice - this is due to be heard in October.  Mr Zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006.  Two years ago, the ANC condemned a painting on show at a Johannesburg shopping centre that depicted the body of Nelson Mandela undergoing an autopsy, saying it violated the anti-apartheid icon's dignity."
